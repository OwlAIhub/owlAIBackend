Data Interpretation 
Data interpretation is one of the easiest chapters of NET
Paper 1. It is basically about drawing conclusions and
inferences from comprehensive data presented numeri-
cally in a tabular or graphical form by means of an illus-
tration, such as graphs, pie charts and so on. Therefore,
the act of organizing and interpreting data to get mean-
ingful information is known as data interpretation. The
important aspects of data sources, their acquisition and
interpretation have been covered in Unit II on research
aptitude. In this unit, the main focus is on solving practi-
cal problems as per questions asked in the NET pattern.

Data interpretation needs some mathematical and sta-
tistical skills. It needs good knowledge of the concepts of
percentage, ratio, proportion, average, etc. The other main
input required is to practice a few problems.

Familiarity with graphical representation of data, such
as Venn diagrams, graphs, pie charts, histogram and poly-
gon, is helpful. Once the data is grasped well, questions
based on tables and graphs take little time.

Sometimes, data is presented in more than one table
or graph. The aim is to test not only the quantitative skills
but also relative, comparative and analytical abilities.

While the terms ‘data’ and ‘statistics’ are often used
interchangeably, in scholarly research there. is an impor-
tant distinction between the two.

Data refers to individual pieces of factual information
recorded and used for the purpose of analysis. It is the raw
information from which statistics are created. Statistics
are the results of data analysis through its interpretation
and presentation.

Data is usually collected for research purposes, and
it is closely related with sampling as well. Data sources,
acquisition and classification have been taken care of in
the second unit of research. Acquisition basically means
collecting data and how it is collected with the help of
interviews, questionnaire and so on. Primary and sec-
ondary sources, quantitative and qualitative data have
also been explained there.

raphical Representation

Basically, it is a graphic representation of data. It is one of
the important ways of analysing numerical data. A graph
is a kind of chart through which statistical data is repre-
sented in the form of lines or curves drawn across coor-
dinated points that are plotted on its surface. Graphs are
also easy to understand and are eye catching.

They help us to study the cause and effect relationship
between two variables, to measure the extent of change in
one variable when another variable changes by a certain
amount.

They enable us to study both the time series and the
frequency distribution. They give clear account and pre-
cise picture of a problem.

GENERAL PrincipLes oF GRAPHIC

REPRESENTATION

Some basic algebraic principles apply to all types
graphic representation of data:

1. There are two lines called coordinate axes, where the
vertical one is known as Y-axis and the horizontal One
is called X-axis (Fig. 7.1). :

2. These two lines are perpendicular to each other
Where these two lines intersect each other is calleq
point ‘O’ or origin.

3. On the X-axis, the distances right of the origin have
positive values and the distances left of the origin
have negative values. On the Y-axis, distances above
the origin have positive values and those below the
origin have negative values.

Graphical representation of data may have many for-
mats. According to the NTA-NET syllabus, graphic repre-
sentation of data has been divided into bar chart, histo-
grams, pie chart, table chart and line chart. Here, we are
discussing their brief description and some numerical
problems.

Bar CHart

It is also known as a column graph, a bar graph or a
bar diagram. It is basically a pictorial representation of
data and is shown as rectangles spaced out with equal
spaces between them and having equal width. Here,
the height (or length) of each bar corresponds to the
frequency of a particular observation. We can draw bar
graphs both vertically and horizontally depending on
whether we take the frequency along the vertical or
horizontal axes, respectively. We can take the following
example.

Bar charts are one of the easiest, graphically attractive
and, hence, most commonly used methods of presenting
all types of data. Given quantities can be compared by
the height or length of a bar graph. A bar graph can have

per vertical or horizontal bars. The width of the bars is
gely inessential and is used only for clarity of presen-
jon. We can compare different quantities or the same
uantity at different times.
In bar graphs, the data is discrete. Presentation

s we could see, the bar chart graph depicts discrete
ata, while histograms depict continuous data. The con-
inuous data can take the shape of class intervals. Thus,
histogram is a graphical representation with class
ntervals or attributes as the base and frequency as the
eight (Fig. 7.3).

Histograms have bars without any spaces between
hem and the rectangles need not be of equal width. It can
e understood with the following example.

Class intervals such as 0-5, 5-10, 10-15 and 15--20 are
ontinuous data. We may ignore the values on the right
ertical axis. Thus, for the class interval 0-5, the cor-
esponding frequency is 3. Again, for the class interval
~10, the frequency is 7 and so on.

tion of the data can be determined by a histogram. In
addition, it can show any outliers or gaps in the data.

DISTRIBUTIONS OF A HISTOGRAM

1. A Normal Distribution: Here, points on one side of
the average are as likely to occur as on the other side
of the average (Fig. 7.4).

a

2. A Bimodal Distribution: In bimodal distribution, the
data should be separated and analysed as separate
normal distributions (Fig. 7.5).

3. A Right-skewed Distribution: A right-skewed distri-
bution is also called a positively skewed distribution.
In a right-skewed distribution, a larger number of
data values occur on the left side and a fewer number
of data values on the right side (Fig. 7.6).

4. Aleft-skewed distribution: A left-skewed distribution
is also called a negatively skewed distribution. A larger
number of data values occur on the right side and a
fewer number of data values on the left side (Fig. 7.7).

Figure 7.7 Left-Skewed Distribution

5. Arandom distribution: A random distribution lacks an
apparent pattern and has several peaks. Here, the dif-
ferent data properties are combined. Therefore, the data
should be separated and analysed separately (Fig. 7.8).

ple is a systematic arrangement of data into vertical
ans and horizontal rows. The process of arranging
into rows and columns is called tabulation.

pOSsE

| purpose of tabulation is to present data in such a way
jt becomes more meaningful and can be easily under-
d bya common person. However, in case of voluminous
a, it may require closer reading than graphs of charts
hence, it is difficult and time consuming to interpret.

ENTIAL PARTS OF A TABLE
atistical table is divided into the following eight parts:

Title of the table: A title is a heading at the top of the
table describing its contents. It mainly reflects upon
the nature of the data, where the data is, what time
period the data covers and how the data is classified.
Caption: The headings for various columns and
rows are called column captions and row captions,
respectively.

irections: The following table shows the monthly
come and various expenditures, of six friends A-F in
solute value or in percentage (in terms of monthly

. Incentive Amounts to 15% of salary.

. All six friends save 40% of their monthly income.

A. There is no expenditure other than those given in the table.
Solution:
An Important Note: We need to quick look at ques-
tions first and see what kind of data may be required.
Accordingly, we are starting with friends A — F. This
question needs to have lots of calculations. We are put-
ting all the information in the table directly. We need to
Create special columns for savings and expenditures for
the given MCQs.

3. Box head: The portion of the table containing the col-
umn caption is called the box head.

4. Stub: The portion of the table containing row caption
is called stub.

5. Body of the table: The body of the table contains the
statistical data that has to be presented in different
rows and columns. :

6. Prefatory notes or head notes: Prefatory notes
appear between the title and the body of the table and
are enclosed in brackets. They may throw some light
on the units of measurements.

7. Footnote: A footnote is always given at the bottom of
the table but above the source note. It is a statement
about something which is not clear from the headings,
title, stubs, captions and so on.

8. Source note: A source note is placed immediately
below the table but after the footnote. It refers to the
source from where information has been taken.

income) form. Some values (marked as ‘’) are missing in
the table which you are expected to calculate if required.
Based on the data in the table, answer the question:

Thus, Monthly Income (MI) = 92000 + 13800 = ¥105800
Accommodation = 10% of MI = 10% of 105800 =%10580
Shopping = 15% of 10580 = €15870

Friend B = Incentives = 15% of Salary

Salary = Incentives / 15 «© 100 = 14400 / 15 «© 100
%96000

Monthly Income = 96000 + 14400 = 7110400
Expenditure = 60% of 110400 = 66240; Savings
%110400 — 66240 = 744160

Friend C: Monthly Income = 84000 + 12600 = %96600
Expenditure = 60% of ¥96600, Savings =

Then calculate all items of expenditure.

engine cars in State ‘D’
(a) 24 (b) 42
(c) 56 (d) 68
Ans: 1.Total number of cars in State B = 28% of 1400
= 392
The Number of Diesel cars in State B = 5/(9+-5)
co 392 = 140
Total Number of cars in State D = 26% of 1400
= 364
(This can be calculated by taking a difference of
2% between B and D, that means 392 ~ 2%
of 1400 = 364)
Number of Petrol cars in State D = Half of 364
= 182
Thus, the difference = 182~140 = 42. (b) is the
correct answer. .O
12. Number of petrol engine cars in State ‘C’ is what per-

cent more than the number of diesel engine cars in

State ‘A’:?

(a) 100% (b) 125%

(c) 200% (d) 120%

Ans: Total cars in State C = 32% of 1400 = 448
No. of Petrol cars in State C = 3/8 0 448 = 168
Total No. of Cars in State A = 14% of 1400 = 196
No. of Diesel cars in State A = 3 / (8+4) 0 196

= 3028 = 84
As comparison is with State A, that is to be taken
as a base.

Thus, required %age = No. of Petrol cars in
State C / No. of Diesel cars in State Ao 100

= 168 / 84 0 100 = 200%. Thus, (c) is the cor-
rect answer.

tioned (AC), then what is the number of diesel engine
cars which are non-AC in State ‘C’?

(a) 150 (b) 90
(c) 190 (d) 210
Ans: From above MCQ, No. of diesel cars in State C =
448 ~ 168 = 280
Thus, No. of non-AC Diesel cars = (100 — 25)%
of 280 = 75% of 280 = 210. (d) is the cor-
rect answer.

14. What is the difference between the total number of

cars in State ‘C’ and the number of petrol engine cars

in State ‘B’?
(a) 212 (b) 224
(c) 204 (d) 196

Ans: Total No. of Cars in State C = 448
Total No. of Petrol cars in State B = 392 — 140

What is the total number of items of type C produced
in the year 2020 and 2021 together?

(a) 12482 (b) 13262

(c) 14786 (d) 15200

Ans: The No. of items of C type produced in 2020 and
2021 = 17% of 48600 + 8% of 62500

= 8262 + 5000 = 13262

Thus, (b) is the correct answer.

2. The number of items-.of type B produced in 2020 is
approximately ___ % of the number of items of type B
produced in 2021.

(a) 84 (b) 87

{c) 90 (d) 93

Ans: Number of type B items produced in 2020 =
18% of 48600 = 8748

316.

741

Number of type B items produced in 2021 =
15% of 62500 = 9375

As comparison is with 2021, that will be taken
as base.

8748
9375

= approx 93%. (d) is the correct answer.

Thus, desired answer = oo 100 = 93.31

33. What is.the ratio of the number of items of type D pro-
duced in 2020 to the number of items of type F pro-
duced in 2021?

972 : 1500
324: 500
81: 125

Thus, (c) is the correct answer.

34. What is the total number of items of type A, B and C
produced by the company in 2020 and 2021 together?

(a) 50897 (b) 51164

(c) 52324 (d) 48542

Ans: Total Number of items by Company A, B and C
in 2020
= (17 + 18 + 17)% of 48600 + (18+ 15 + 8)%
of 62500

= 52% of 48600 + 41% of 62500 = 25272 +
25625 = 50897

Thus, (a) is the correct answer.

35. The number of items of type E produced in the year .
2021 is___% more than the number of items of type
C produced in 2021.

(a) 105 (b) 75

(c) 60 (d) 125

Ans: Note that we don’t need to do calculation with
62500, that is total of production of 2021.

The total is to assumed to be 100, and calcula-
tions to be done accordingly.

As they belong to the same year 2021, the %age
difference between E and C = 18-8 = 10

No. of items of type C in 2021 = 8

As the comparison is with C, that will be taken
as the base.

Thus, required answer = 10 ~ 100 = 125%.
(d) is the correct answer.

Cincte Grarns (on Pie Cuarts)

Circle graphs are used to show how various sectors are in the
whole. They are popularly called pie charts. Circle graphs
usually give the percentage that each sector receives.

In such representation, the total quantity in question
is distributed over a total angle of 360°. While using pie
chart to find the ratios of various sectors, there is no need
to find the amounts each sector received and then the
ratio of the amounts. Find the ratio of the percentages,
which is much easier.

If some percentage figure is to be converted into degrees
of angles extended at the centre, then multiply it by 3.6. For
example, if some category is 20%, in degrees equivalent, it
is 72°, that is, (20 x 3.6). Conversely, if degree data is to be
converted into per cent figure, then divide it by 3.6.

(a) 22,950 (b) 45,000

(c) 745,900 (d) %48,900

Ans: (c) The ratio between printing cost and royalty
= 20:15 0r4:3.
Let royalty be denoted by R.
Then 4: 3=61,200:R
Rx4= 61,200 x 3
R= (61,200 x 3)/4 = 245,900

72,. If the cost price of the book is 7150, then what is the

combined printing and binding cost for a single copy
of the book?

(a) 60 (b) 75

(c) 80 (d) *72

Ans: (a) Total printing and binding cost = 20 + 20
= 40%

Printing and binding cost = 40% of cost price
= 40% of 150 =%60

73. What is the central angle of the sector corresponding
to the expenditure incurred on royalty?
(a) 48° (b) 54°
(c) 60° (d) 72°



=== Page 18 ===
7.18

Ans: (b) Central angle corresponding to royalty
= (15% of 360)° = 15/100 x 360 = 54°

74, What is the difference between promotion and
printing cost if we assume that total cost is 200?

(a) §10 (b) ¥20

(c) ¥30 (d) 24

Ans: (b) Difference in percentage terms = 20-10
= 10%

Then, 10% of 200 = €20

75. If 1000 copies are published and the transportation
cost on them amounts to $15,000, then what should
be the selling price per book so that the publisher can

earn a profit of 20%?
(a) $150 (b) €160
(c) 7180 (d) ¥200

Ans: (c) To calculate the selling price of a single
book, we need to total the cost. Let us calculate
that first.

Transportation cost per book = 15,000/1000
=%15

As transportation cost is 10% of total cost, thus
%15 = 10% of total cost

Total cost of printing a copy = 15 x 100/10
=%150

Now selling price = total cost + profit
= 150 + 20% of 150 = 150+ 30 =%180

[J Data Mapping - |

’ Data mapping is the process of mapping data fields from a
source file to their related target fields. The accessibility to
required data can make some organization more success-
ful. Somehow, data is easier to use when it is visualized.

Visual data helps people understand how different con-
cepts originate and their relation with each other. Data
mapping helps in all these. For example, ‘Name’, ‘Email’
and ‘Phone’ fields from an Excel source are mapped to the
relevant fields in a delimited file, which is our destination.

Data mapping helps by providing organizations with
procedure links to show how certain tasks are to be uti-
lized. Forty per cent of our nerve fibres that are linked
to the brain are in the retina. Data mapping helps us see
what makes different pieces of data useful and helpful.

Customer trends can be traced in the real time. The
causes of trends and past data numbers can be analysed
and other calculations of information and variables can
be done. We can also use data mapping software to com-
pare our date with that of competitors. This should make
it easier for your business to grow when chosen right.

It also works by establishing larger maps. Sales-force of
any organization has a particularly strong data mapping
software program that can be put to use. This helps in real
time also. We can get connected to a cloud network to get
information in real time. ,

Data mapping works for all businesses. For example
if we were in the retail sector, then we can use data man
ping to calculate how discount sales can influence the
overall sales totals in a business. Similarly, financing and
investment decisions can also be made. :

Data may be internal or external, but if it is Settin,
more dispersed and voluminous, then data leverage is
important and actionable insights should be developed.

There are arrays of data points to collect information.
Their language may be quite different. We can develop
separate data models.

Data mapping tasks vary in complexity, depending op
the hierarchy or disparity between the structure of the
source and of the target. Every application, on-premise or
on cloud basis, uses metadata to explain data fields.

Microsoft SharePoint, InetSoft Style Intelligence
and IBM Cognos Business Intelligence help us to review
information by generating simple charts and graphs.
Depending on the number and schema of the data
sources, database mappings can have a varying degree of
complexity.

In general, data mapping helps with the following
activities.

Data INTEGRATION

It includes data mapping tools to cover differences in the
schemas of data source and destination, allowing busi-
nesses to consolidate information from different data
points easily.

Data Migration
It is moving data from one database to another. Here,

using a code-free data mapping solution that can auto.

mate the process is important to migrate data to the des-
tination successfully.

Data WaREHOUSING

Data mapping in a data warehouse is the process of creat-
ing a connection between the source and the target tables
or attributes,

Data TRANSFORMATION

It is essential to break information silos and draw insights.
Data mapping is the first step in data transformation.

Data Mappinc Techniques

Although an essential step in any data management pro-
cess, data mapping can be complex and time-consuming.
Based on the level of automation, data mapping tech-
niques can be divided into two types: '

1, Manual Data Mapping: Although hand-coded, man-
_ ual data mapping process offers unlimited flexibility.
2. Semi-automated Data Mapping: Schema mapping

is often classified as a semi-automated data mapping

technique. The process involves identifying two data -

objects that are semantically related and then build-
ing mappings between them.

jnterpretation of data assigns a meaning to the infor-
tion analysed and determines its signification and
cations. It refers to the implementation of processes
ough which data is reviewed for the purpose of arriv-
at an informed conclusion.
feeping in view its importance, data mapping should
done properly. Data is obtained from multiple sources,
t needs to enter the analysis process with haphazard
ering. Data analysis is usually subjective and, thus,
goals of interpretation may vary from one business to
ther. Basically, there are two main types of analysis,
ntitative and qualitative.
good decision should be made regarding scales of
asurement. The varying scales include the following:

Nominal scale: It consists of non-numeric categories
that cannot be ranked or compared quantitatively.
variables are exclusive and exhaustive.

Ordinal scale: It consists of categories that are exclu-
sive and exhaustive but with a logical order. Quality
ratings and agreement ratings are examples of ordi-
nal scales (i.e. good, very good, fair, etc., or agree,
strongly agree, disagree, etc.).

¢ Interval: It is a measurement scale where data is
grouped into categories with orderly and equal dis-
tances between the categories. There is always an
arbitrary zero point.

* Ratio: It contains features of all three mentioned
above.

hen interpreting data, an analyst must try to discern
e differences between correlation, causation and coin-
dences, etc., in addition to some other factors: In this
it, we will look at the two main methods of inter-
etation of data with a qualitative and a quantitative
alysis.

UALITATIVE DaTA INTERPRETATION

arrative data is mostly collected by employing a wide
riety of person-to-person techniques. It is basically
described as ‘categorical’. The description is not through
numerical values or patterns but through descriptive
mtext or text. These techniques include the following
rameters:

* Observations: Here, behaviour patterns may be the
amount of type and time spent in an activity and com-
munication used.

Documents: Here, different types of documentation
resources can be coded and divided based on the type
of material they contain.

Interviews: They are described as the best collection
method for narrative data. Enquiry responses can
be grouped by theme, topic or category. The inter-
view approach helps in highly focused data segmen-
tation.

A person to person data collection technique can lead to

build- tO Perso) , ; :
hree basic principles, notice things, collect things and

7.19

think about things. Qualitative data much open to inter-
pretation must be ‘coded’ so as to facilitate the grouping
and labelling of data into identifiable themes.

Quantitative Data INTERPRETATION

The keyword in quantitative is ‘numerical’. It is a set of pro-
cesses by which numerical data is analysed. It involves the
use of statistical modelling, such as standard deviation,
mean and median. Let’s quickly review the most common
statistical terms that are as follows:

* Mean: A mean represents a numerical average for a
set of responses.

® Standard Deviation: It reveals the distribution of
the responses around the mean, the degree of con-
sistency within the responses and then insight into
data sets.

* Frequency Distribution: This is a measurement of
gauging the rate of a response appearance within
a data set. It is extremely keen.in determining the
degree of consensus among data points.

It entails correlation tests between two or more variables.
The different processes can be used together or sepa-
rately, and comparisons can be made to ultimately arrive
at a conclusion. Other signature interpretation processes
of quantitative data include the following:

° Regression analysis
* Cohort analysis
° Predictive and prescriptive analysis

imPORTANCE OF Data INTERPRETATION

The purpose of collection and interpretation is to acquire
useful and usable information and to make the most
informed decisions possible. Data interpretation includes
the following characteristics:

®° Data identification and explanation
° Comparing and contrasting of data
° Identification of data outliers

° Future predictions

There are some common issues with data interpretation:

1. Informed Decision Making: Data analysis should
include identification, thesis development and data
collection followed by data communication.

2. Anticipating needs with Trends Identification:

Data insights provide knowledge, and knowledge is

power.

Cost Efficiency: Proper implementation of data anal-

ysis processes can provide businesses with profound

cost advantages within their industries.

4. Clear Foresight: Companies that collect and analyse
their data gain better knowledge about themselves,
their processes and performance.

od

In addition, there are certain problems with data inter-
pretation.



=== Page 20 ===
7.20

It is usually said that ‘big data equals big trouble’ where
some ‘pitfalls’ do exist and can occur when analysing data,
especially at the speed of thought. Let’s identify three of the
most common data misinterpretation risks and shed some
light on how they can be avoided:

1. Correlation mistaken for causation: It is the
tendency of data analysts to mix the cause of a
phenomenon with its correlation. When two actions
occurred together, one caused the other. This is not
accurate as actions can occur together. The remedy is
to attempt to eliminate the variable you believe to be
causing the phenomenon.

2. Confirmation Bias: It occurs when we havea theory
or hypothesis in mind, but are intent on discover-
ing only data patterns that provide support, while
rejecting those that do not. This pitfall is often
based on subjective desires. Thus, always remem-
ber to try to disprove a hypothesis rather than try to
prove it.

3. Irrelevant Data: As large data is no longer centrally
stored and as it continues to be analysed at the
speed of thought, it is inevitable that analysts will
focus on data that is irrelevant to the problem they
are trying to correct. The remedy is to proactively
and clearly frame any data analysis variables and
key performance indicators prior to engaging in a
data review.

Keeping in view all these aspects, we need to be careful
about the following factors:

1. Collect your data and make it as clean as possible.

2. We need to be careful about the type of analysis to
perform, be it qualitative or quantitative, and apply
the methods, respectively, to each. We have already
discussed qualitative and quantitative aspects.

3. We may need to take a step back and think about data
from various perspectives and what it means for vari-
ous participants or actors of the project.

4. Weneed to reflect on our own thinking and reasoning,
such as correlation versus causation, subjective bias,
false information and inaccurate data.

Data governance is a requirement in today’s fast-moving
and highly competitive enterprise environment. Now that
organizations have the opportunity to capture massive
amounts of diverse internal and external data, they need
a discipline to maximize their value, manage risks and
reduce costs. >

Data governance is a collection of processes, roles,
policies, standards and metrics that ensures the effective
and efficient use of information in enabling an organiza-
tion to achieve its goals. It defines who can take what
action, on what data, in what situations and using what
methods.

Data governance ensures that roles related to data are
clearly defined, and that responsibility and accountability °

are agreed upon across the enterprise. A well-planne
data governance framework covers strategic, tactica] and
operational roles and responsibilities. :

Primary Ossectives in ICT Epucation

India aligns with the following three primary objectives
as per our framework:

1. ICT Education: This entails preparing a skilled work-
force to meet the IT needs of our knowledge-driven
society, encompassing both software and hardware.

2. ICT-supported Education: Often referred to as
multimedia education, this approach is adopted by
numerous distance education institutions, comple-
menting printed study materials with ICT tools such
as radio and TV programs, audio and video record-
ings, and multimedia content distributed via:‘CDs.

ICT-enabled Education: In this scenario, an all-

encompassing educational program is delivered

2. Elevating the quality of teaching, particularly in
remote areas.

3. Enhancing transparency and strengthening educa-
tional systems, processes, and compliance standards.

4. Measuring student learning participation and
effectiveness.

5. Analyzing student behaviour to optimize engage-
ment, improve retention, and enhance employability.

6. Evaluating student performance, placement, applica-

rics for institutional branding.

STRENGTHS AND Limitations oF ICT in EpucaTion
Sector

There is demographic dividend available to India, there
will be 100 crores graduates in coming 25 years. ICT
offers various advantages, including:

1. Personalized Learning: ICT enables customized
education to cater to individual learning preferences
and pacing.

2. Interactivity: Learners can engage more effectively
with content through interactivity, enabling them to
navigate content flexibly based on prior knowledge
and experience.

3. Insensitivity to Distance and Climate: ICT allows
education to transcend geographical and climatic
constraints.

4. Cost-effectiveness, Rapid Delivery, and Wider Reach:
As the number of learners increases, ICT becomes
more economical, offers higher delivery speeds, and
reaches a broader audience.

5. Diverse Teaching Functions and Audiences: ICT,
particularly computer- and internet-based technolo-
gies, are valuable for drills, practice, and accessing
information on various related themes.

low cost, promoting equality in education.

LIMITATIONS oF ICT

1. High Infrastructure and Start-up Costs: Building and
maintaining ICT systems, including hardware and soft-
ware, can be costly. That requires lots of skills, but this
may come down as there is laot of competition in the mar-
ket now to provide updated technologies at a lower price.

To deal with Individual Differences for Economies

of Scale: To reduce costs, identical content may be

delivered to all learners, potentially overlooking the

diverse learning needs of individuals and creating a

digital divide.

3. Accessibility Challenges: Factors such as timing,
electricity supply, socio-cultural aspects, poverty, illit-
eracy, time constraints, mobility, and relevance can
impede accessibility.

4. ICT Primarily as a Delivery System: ICT serves as a

content delivery tool rather than initiating significant

attitudinal or behavioural changes.

5. Difficulty in Performance Evaluation: Assessing
performance takes time due to the multidimensional
and long-term nature of ICT-based learning.

6. Ongoing Training Requirements: As technologies
evolve, trainers require continuous training, which
may face resistance.

7. Call for an Attitudinal Shift in Teaching and
Learning: There are psychological and social effects
of online digital education, perception of parents,
pupil teacher ratio to deal with. ICT primarily serves
as a communication tool, potentially increasing
transactional distance and raising concerns about
plagiarism.

ICT LEARNING Catecories in Epucation

Education within the realm of ICT is divided into three
main categories:

1. E-learning

2. Blended learning

3. Distance learning

Additionally, these categories can encompass face-to-
face, self-paced, and online collaborative learning.

E-learning or Electronic-Learning

E-learning leverages Advanced Learning Technologies
(ALT) to enhance human learning using advanced net-
worked and multimedia technologies. It overcomes tim-
ing, attendance, and travel limitations, encouraging
greater participation and interaction.

Blended Learning

Blended learning amalgamates diverse approaches to
education, combining face-to-face learning, self-paced
learning, and online classrooms.

6. Uniform Quality: ICT ensures the same quality of
education is accessible to all segments of society at a

(a) Face-to-Face Learning: Traditional classroom lear
ing with a faculty member delivering instruction
to a group of learners through lectures, workshopg
presentations, tutoring, and conferences. We tieeq t
refer to UGC policy for this.

(b) Self-paced Learning: Self-paced learning offers flex.
ibility for learners to study at their own pace. Learner:
engage with course material through various mean,
including reading textbooks, web-based or CD-base
courses, pre-recorded classes, and internet research.

(c) Online Collaborative Learning: This form of learn

ing involves interactions between learners and facy]

members through web-based platforms, enabling
both synchronous and asynchronous interactions —

(discussed below)

Distance Learning

Distance learning allows students to work independently
from home or office, connecting with faculty and peers
through email, electronic forums, video conferencing, :
chat rooms, instant messaging, and other computer-based.
communication methods. It is also known as open learn. |
ing. The internet, computer-based training (CBT), and the.
creation of ‘virtual classrooms’ facilitate this process.

‘Digital libraries’ created through ICTs provide stu-
dents, teachers, and professionals with access to research.
and course materials from any location at any time,
These facilities promote networking among academics.
and researchers, enhancing the quality of teaching and
learning.

AccorbiING to SizE AND GONFIGURATION

There are four different types of computers which are
classified based on their size and configuration. These
have been discussed in the subsequent paragraphs.

Analog Computers

« Analog computers process continuous data, they use
data that changes smoothly, such as the temperature
on a thermometer or the volume on a stereo system.

e They were used in the past to transmit information,
such as radio and television signals.

e Examples of analog computers include thermom-
eters, vintage radios, and stereo systems.

Digital Computers

e Digital computers use data that is made up of separate
parts (discrete data), like the numbers 0 and 1.

° Digital computers are very accurate and fast, and can
be used to solve complex problems.

© They are used in many different fields, including sci-
ence, engineering, and technology.

e Examples of digital computers include personal com-
puters, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

Further division of digital computers

General-purpose computers: They are designed to per-
form a wide range of tasks. They are the most common
type of computer, and include personal computers (PCs),
laptops, tablets, and smartphones. General-purpose com-
puters have a central processing unit (CPU) that can be
programmed to perform different tasks. This flexibility
makes them ideal for a variety of applications, such as
word processing, web browsing, gaming, and running
software applications.

Special-purpose computers: They are designed to per-
form a specific task. They are often used in embedded sys-
tems, which are computer systems that are part of a larger

device. Examples of special-purpose computers include:

e¢ Microcontrollers: Microcontrollers are small, low-
power computers that are used in a variety of devices,
such as appliances, cars, and medical devices.

e Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs): FPGAs
are chips that can be programmed to perform specific
tasks. They are often used in high-performance com-
puting and aerospace applications.

e Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs):
ASICs are chips that are custom-designed for a spe-
cific application. They offer the best performance and
power efficiency, but they are also the most expensive
to develop.

Special vs General Computers

Special-purpose computers are usually more efficient 9
powerful than general-purpose computers as they ar
customised accordingly. :
' For example, GPUs are much faster than CPUs at
cessing graphics, making it ideal for gaming and vig,
editing. :

A GPU as a special purpose computer that is designeg

A CPU, on the other hand, is designed to perform
wide range of tasks, so it has fewer transistors that ay
dedicated to graphics processing.

used in businesses and organizations that need to
process a lot of data but do not need the power of a
mainframe.

e Many manufacturers now market their machines as

‘servers’ or ‘high-performance workstations,’ regard-
less of their size or power. This has happened due
to the fact that performance of minicomputers has
increased significantly. ,
Examples: They are used in a variety of tasks, such

user computers designed to handle large amounts of
data and complex tasks. They have robust graphics
capabilities.

e More Powerful than personal computers: They are
more powerful than personal computers but less pow-
erful than mainframes. Workstations offer a number
of advantages in comparison to personal computers,
including higher processing power, more memory,
better graphics capabilities, and greater reliability.

e Ideal for Design: They shine in tasks like desktop
publishing, software development, and engineering.

e Network Ready: Workstations can be linked in a
local area network (LAN) for office communication
and file-sharing.

e Laptops: Portable and powerful, great for on-the-go
work and entertainment.

e Handhelds (PDAs): Highly portable, designed for
organizing tasks and personal data. Less powerful but
perfect for their intended functions.

We must notice that the lines between mainframes,
minicomputers, workstations, and microcomputers have
become blurred in recent years. Many manufacturers now
market their machines as ‘servers’ or ‘high-performance
workstations’, regardless of their size or power.

Central processing unit

CPU acts as the conductor. This is often referred as the braj

(and heart) of the system. It directs the flow of informa i
between the various components. Memory provides t
CPU with immediate access to the data and instructions ‘
needs, while input devices allow users to interact with th
computer and provide instructions or data. Output devicg,
present the results of the CPU’s processing.to the user, an,
storage devices ensure that data and programs rema;,
available even when the computer is turned off.

CENTRAL Processine Unit (CPU)
CPU functions as a microprocessor, plays a pivotal role j
orchestrating the execution of program instructions. Unlik,
ICs, which are dedicated to specific tasks, the programmes 5
microprocessor deals with diverse set of functions, such as:

e Arithmetic Operations: Performing mathematica
calculations, such as addition, subtraction, division
multiplication, and comparisons.

e Logical Operations: Managing logical comparison
and operations.

° Input/Output Operations: Facilitating the exchang
of data between the computer and external devices,

e Data Manipulations: Handling data transformation:
and manipulations. .

Key Components Within the CPU

The CPU comprises several integral components, eac
contributing to its functionality:

1. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): The ALU specializes i
executing diverse calculations, encompassing arith.
metic operations like addition and subtraction, a
well as more complex tasks like division, multiplica
tion, and comparisons.

2. Control Unit (CU): Responsible for coordinatin,
hardware operations, managing the flow and execu:
tion of data and instructions, and overseeing dat
transfers between the main storage and the ALU o
storage devices.

3. Memory Unit (Main Storage): Serving as a reposi
tory for data, instructions, intermediate results, an

inal outcomes, the memory unit holds information
eady for processing and output. Data and instruc-
ions are directed to and from the main storage, all
nder the watchful control of the CU.

pU Scheduling (Enhancing Efficiency and
airness): Optimizing CPU utilization is vital to
chieving efficiency and fairness in a computer sys-
tem. CPU scheduling ensures that processes are allot-
‘ted CPU time, preventing delays related to resource
‘unavailability. Various algorithms, such as ‘First In
First Out (FIFO),’ ‘Last In First Out (LIFO),’ ‘Shortest
Job First (SJF),’ and ‘Round Robin’ with time-sharing
capabilities, help manage CPU resources effectively.

In modern computing, memory capacity has
expanded significantly. A ‘megabyte’ represents 1 mil-
lion bytes, a ‘gigabyte’ equates to 1 billion bytes, and
_a ‘terabyte’ encompasses a staggering 1 trillion bytes.
For instance, a computer with 64 megabytes of mem-
ory can store a wealth of 64 million bytes of data. This
has been discussed with the help of a diagram on page
8,18.

Registers (The Specialized Memory Units): Within
the CPU, high-speed, special-purpose memory units
known as registers play a pivotal role in program exe-
cution. These registers store critical information and
are primarily used for managing small data.

Motherboard (The Nerve Centre of System): The
computer’s main circuit board, the motherboard,
houses the CPU, memory, and expansion slots. These
expansion slots accommodate additional circuit
boards, often referred to as adapters or cards.

Buses (Data Highways): Buses serve as a set of paral-

lel pathways for connecting the CPU to various input
and output devices. These data highways facilitate

8.15

the bidirectional transmission of data between the
CPU and connected peripherals.

Peripheral Devices (Expanding Functionality):
Peripheral devices encompass a wide range of hard-
ware that can be connected to a computer, enhanc-
ing its capabilities. This category includes monitors,
keyboards, mice, webcams, drawing pads, joysticks,
modems, printers, scanners, interactive whiteboards,
and more.

9, Input Devices (Feeding Information): Any hard-
ware capable of inputting data into a computer system
is classified as an input device. Examples include key-
boards, microphones, mice, scanners, and webcams.

10. Output Devices (Translating Digital to Analog):

Output devices handle the presentation of processed
information, taking digital data and rendering it in
a usable format. These devices include monitors,
headphones, printers, speakers, plotters, and Visual
Display Units (VDUs).
Computer hardware, with its diverse components,
forms the bedrock of digital technology, enabling the
creation, manipulation, and storage of electronic data
while bridging the physical and digital realms.

Memory Types AND FUNCTIONS

Computer memory comes in various types, each striking a
balance between speed and cost:

Cache Memory: Cache memory is high speed volatile
memory that is located closest to the CPU. When the CPU
requests data from RAM, it checks the cache memory first
for faster access. Cache memory is designed to bridge the
speed gap between the CPU and main memory (RAM).

SRAM is typically used for small caches, so we need to
look at the following aspects for detailed idea:

* Cache memory is closely associated with SRAM
(Static Random Access Memory).

* SRAM employs flip-flops to store data bits.

° Flip-flops are bistable circuits, Which are the most
fundamental that is capable of maintaining either a 0
or 1 state.

® SRAM?’s fast data access is attributed to its ability to
access data without refreshing memory cells.

* Cache memory is divided into three levels: L1, L2, and
L3.

¢ 1 cache is the smallest and fastest cache mem-
ory that has a size of few kilobytes. L1 is located
on CPU or closest to CPU, L1 matters the most
for the speed of computer. L1 reduces the time it
takes for the CPU to fetch data from main mem-
ory. The main memory is located on a separate
chip that is slower than cache memory.

* L2cacheis positioned on a separate chip between
L1 cache and main memory. This acts as a buffer
for less frequently accessed data. The size may be
tens of kilobytes that is larger than that of L1.

To put this scene further, we can say that L2 cache
acts as a bridge between the L1 cache, which is
the fastest and smallest cache, and main mem-
ory, which is the largest and slowest memory.

* L3 cache: This cache is located on a separate
chip, it is megabytes or more in size. The speed is
less than L2. L3 is least expensive. The basic of L3
may be SRAM or DRAM.

RAM is known as the main memory. RAM is volatile,
means that data is lost when the computer is switched
off. Computers can both write data to and read dat
from RAM.
When the power is switched off, any data stored j
RAM is lost.

DRAM is a common type of system memory that j
used for larger main memory. This is a type of sem
conductor memory in computers. This is volatile, it
means that data is lost when the computer is turned
off. DRAM is generally more cost-effective than
SRAM. SRAM doesn’t require refreshing to retain
data, unlike DRAM needs to be refreshed periodically.
to prevent data loss.
DVD-RAM: DVD-RAM is basically Digital Versatil
Disc RAM which can be read and written to mult
ple times. These discs use phase-change technolo
where data is stored in the physical structure of the.
disc. These discs are more durable and less suscep-
tible to damage than CD-RW and DVD-R.

e following discussion helps the learners in the better
derstanding of the memory storage devices so that we
ve the absolute clarity of the data movement. This has
en discussed separately with data flow motives only:

Central Processing Unit: Consider CPU as the city cen-
tre, the hub of all major activities and decision-making,
_akin to the administrative headquarters of a city.
Registers: These are like immediate, small offices
_inside the CPU where swift data processing occurs,
closest to the city centre for rapid information access.
Cache and SRAM (Static RAM): The cache, sup-
ported by SRAM for its speed, is comparable to local,
fast-access storage facilities near the city centre
(CPU). They store data the CPU is likely to need soon,
offering quicker access than distant warehouses.

Bus: The bus system is the city’s transportation net-
work, connecting different parts like the CPU, RAM,
and storage devices. It facilitates data movement
within the computer, akin to roads in a city. A wider
bus (higher bandwidth) means more data can travel
at once, just as broader roads allow for more traffic.
RAM: RAM is like the city’s warehouses, storing more
data than caches or registers but with slower access.
It’s where active data (current applications and files)
is kept for quick retrieval by the CPU.

» ROM: Think of ROM as a museum or archive, hold-
ing crucial, unchangeable system data necessary
for boot-up and basic functioning, akin to the basic
instructions for starting the computer.

Hard Drive/Storage: These represent the city’s long-
term storage units or warehouses located on the out-
skirts, used for storing data that isn’t immediately
needed but is important for long-term retention.

nd these instructions cannot be accessed or modified —

8.17

Note: The above analogy highlights how the cost of each
computer component is influenced by its function, speed,
and proximity to the CPU (‘city centre’), much like real
estate prices vary based on location and facilities in a city.

The city centre is the costliest, and most complex due to

its central role in processing data. Storage components
such as Hard Drives are less expensive.

Memory Classification by Volatility
Memory can also be classified based on its volatility:

Volatile Memory: This temporary memory type only
retains data while power is supplied. RAM is a prime
example of volatile memory.

Non-Volatile Memory: Permanent in nature, this mem-
ory type retains data even after the system is powered off.
ROM is an instance of non-volatile memory.

Storage Devices Categories
Computer storage devices are divided into two categories:

(i) Internal Storage Devices: These devices are compo-
nents located inside a computer. For instance, Hard
disks, which are magnetic disks used for storing com-
puter data. They typically offer substantial storage
capacity and are traditionally known for their speed
and performance.

(ii) External Storage Devices: Portable storage devices
are commonly used for data mobility. Examples are:

° USB flash drives, often called pen drives or mem-
ory sticks.

e Optical discs like CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs.
USB flash drives are small, flat, and resemble
a pen in shape. They offer substantial storage
capacity and can be easily inserted into any com-
puter’s USB socket for data transfer.

HDD or SSD - The Storage Technology Choices

HDDs and SSDs are storage devices, with SSDs being the
newer technological innovation, so we buy systems with
SSDs.

Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)

e HDDS are also known as hard drives, are traditional
storage devices that have been widely used for
decades.

e They employ a rotating platter system to store data
magnetically. The platter consists of a thin, circular
disc coated with a magnetic material.

e As the platter spins at high speeds, read/write heads
hover close to the surface, reading and modifying the
magnetic patterns that represent data.

Advantages of HDDs

1. Cost-Effective: HDDs offer a significant cost advan-
tage compared to solid-state drives (SSDs). HDDs are
much economical and thus attractive in terms of Per
gigabyte or terabyte storage.

2. Large Storage Capacities: This makes them ideal for

bulk data storage. They can store large media files, .

such as movies, photos, and documents. HDDs have
better secondary storage capacity, thus, costlier SSDs
can store less frequently accessed data.

3, Wide Compatibility: HDDs are more compatible
with computers, laptops, servers, and external enclo-

sures. Their standardized interface ensures seamless
integration into various systems.

HDDs have the limitations of slower performance, sus-
ceptibility to damage, noise generation etc.
SSD (Solid State Drive) — .

° §SDs utilize flash memory, with individual memory
cells instantly accessible by the controller. SSDs have
no moving parts.

e SSDs are suitable for storing operating systems, gam-
ing apps, and frequently used files.

° §SDs have no moving parts, so they are less suscep-
tible to physical damage from shock or vibration.

° The failure rate of SSDs lower in comparison to HDDs.

° Additionally, SSDs have faster boot times, faster appli-
cation loading times, quieter operation and lower
power consumption.

Booting and Rebooting

Booting: This process initiates a computer when pow-
ered on. It may be triggered by hardware or software
commands. During booting, the CPU lacks software in
its main memory, necessitating the loading of software
before execution. This can be performed by hardware or
firmware within the CPU or a separate processor.

Rebooting: Rebooting is the act of restarting a computer,
achievable in two ways. A ‘hard’ reboot involves pow-
ering off and then on. A ‘soft’ reboot maintains power
continuity.

Computer storage devices serve as the memory banks of
digital systems, ensuring data persistence, quick retrieval,
and streamlined operations, bridging the gap between
volatile processing and permanent data retention.

when to do it, and how to do it. When software is stored

a PC, it’s termed firmware, falling between software and
hardware. ;

SYSTEM SOFTWARE

This category is responsible for enabling the basic fyy
tions of a computer, ensuring it runs efficiently, and ma
aging hardware resources. It includes drivers, operat;
systems (OSs), servers, and utilities. The primary comp.
nents of system software are the OS and utility software

Types of System Software

1. Compilers: Let’s look at source code and object Co,
first. . .

Source code is the hurnan-readable version of a co
puter program. {t is written in a programming la
guage, such as Python, Java, or C++. This is typica
written in a text editor.
Object code is the machine-readable version of
computer program. It is generated. by a compile
which converts the source code into a form that cq
be executed by the computer’s CPU.

Compliers convert source code from program
ming languages into object code. This happens du
to the reason that object code is more efficient f
the computer to execute than source code. And th
object code is more portable than source code,
means that object code can be executed on any com
puter. Examples include ALGOL, BASIC, C++, an
FORTRAN compilers.

Operating System (OS): The OS controls all oth
resources in a computer system, coming in differer
bit architectures like 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit. Exam
ples include Unix/BSD, GNU/Linux, Windows, Ma
OS, embedded, real-time OS, and experimental O
like Oberon/Bluebottle and Plan 9.

Background on OS: Windows, developed in 198
added a graphical user interface (GUD to MS-DO
Mac OS was one of the early OSs with a GUI. Linux,
developed by Linus Torvalds, is a freely available
multi-tasking and multi-user OS released under th
General Public License (GPL).

3. Utility Software: Designed to aid in analyzing, mon
toring, configuring, optimizing settings, and main
taining the computer. Examples are:
° Media Player Skins: These are customizabl

interfaces that allow users to change the look and
feel of their media playback software.

¢ DVD Burners: Hardware or software tools used t

write data onto writable DVDs for storage or pla
back, though their popularity decreased now.

Antivirus Software: Programs designed to detect,
prevent, and remove malicious software, viruses,
and other security threats from computers.

Desktop Widgets: Small applications or tools
that run on the desktop, providing quick access
to information and tasks.

Backup Software: Applications used to create
copies of data ensure that important files are safe
and can be recovered in case of loss or damage

Application Software: This type of software assists
users in performing specific tasks. It’s divided into:

Productivity Software: Examples encompass
word processors, spreadsheets, schedulers, data-
base management systems (DBMS), desktop pub-
lishing tools, and. enterprise resource planning
(ERP) software.

» Collaborative Software: Also known as group-
ware software, these facilitate collaboration, with
applications like Facebook and Etherpad.

Proprietary vs. Open Software: Software can be
proprietary (closed) or open. Proprietary software
is privately owned and controlled, with undisclosed
_ specifications to prevent duplication. Open software
_ is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to create add-
on products and understand its design.

Freeware: It’s software that can be copied and used

without payment to the author(s), though there
might be distribution restrictions.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

ogramming languages are tools for telling computers
hat to de. They come in different levels of complexity.
Below is the user friendly overview of languages:

. Machine Language

* This is basically the first generational language.

* This is the language computers understand, using
Os and 1s.

® Tt’s hard for humans to use because it’s all in
binary code.

» Programmers now prefer high level programming
language or an assembly language.

2. Assembly Language

® This is a step up, actually a second generational
language and this is also known as symbolic
machine code.

» tt uses ‘names’ for instructions and variables,
instead of numbers, thus making it more readable
than machine language.

* For example, it uses words like MOV and ADD
instead of just Os and 1s.

3. High-Level Language (HLL)
® These are the languages most programmers use
today, like C++ and Java.

° They’re very readable because they use English

words.
¢ HLL programs are translated into assembly or
machine language by a compiler or interpreter.

A Learner should note the following:
° First and second-generation languages are low-
level (machine and assembly).

e Third, fourth, and fifth-generation languages are
high-level (HLL).

Program

° A program isa set of instructions for the computer.

° Computers read these instructions as 1s and Os.

° Programs can be written in assembly or HLL and are
initially called source programs.

e They need to be translated into machine language to
run.

Language Processors

° Assernbler: Converts assembly language into
machine language.

° Interpreter: Translates HLL programs line by line
and reports errors immediately.

° Compiler: Translates the entire HLL program at once,
reporting all errors at the end. Once errors are fixed,
you don’t need the compiler in memory anymore

because you have an object program.

This basic overview should help us to understand the
different levels of programming languages and how pro-
grams are created for computers.

Binary Numeer System

Formally, we all know that base-10 system is a positiong
system.

In decimal notation, we write a number as a string o
symbols, where each symbol is one of these 10 digits, and
to interpret a decimal number, we multiply each digit b
the power of 10 associated with that digit’s position.

The binary system uses only two symbols, 0 and 1, to
represent values.

Computers are built from transistors and an individua
transistor can only be ON or OFF (two options).

Thus, the values in a binary system, such as 0’s and
l’s, are called binary digits or bits. Computers use base 2
because they can recognize only two values, 1 or 0. We

Binary Digit (Bit)
It is a digit within the binary number system. A bit is the
smallest unit of information held in a computer. In ordey

to make the bits useful, they are combined into bytes of
information.

Byte

It is a combination of bits that represents one characte;
A byte is usually composed of 8 bits.

American Standard Code for information
interexchange (ASCII)

It assigns a specific pattern of (ASCII) to each char.
acter as described earlier. Another code that may be
found, especially in IBM brand mainframe computers,

(EBCDIC).

Extended Binary Coded Decimal
Interchange Code

The important point to remember about these codes is that
their main value is to store information so that it is read-
able by other computers. By using ASCII or EBCDIC, it is
possible for people to retrieve and use someone else’s data
using a different type of hardware or software. The main
disadvantage of using ASCII is that formatting or other
special qualities of computer-ized information may be lost.

0% InvRANET ~ For INTERNAL COMMUNICATION

OF. Intranet is basically a Private Network, that functions as
o 4 Intranet as a dedicated network exclusively for a company’s

employees, thus it greatly enhances internal communication.

8.23

° Secure Environment: Intranet provides a safe envi-
ronment as a protected platform.

* Resource Allocation: Intranet works as a ‘repository
of resources, for internal users.

© Firewall Protection: Intranet is often isolated from
the broader internet by firewalls, that again helps in
the privacy of internal communication.

° Overcoming Limitations: Intranets address con-
straints associated with conventional LANs and WANs.

Technological Backbone

* Common Technology: Intranets operate on widely
adopted technologies which functions with Telnet,
File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or Gopher, it is the web
that predominantly prevails.

° User-Friendly Web Interface: Leveraging the web
and its familiar browsers offers a cornfortable and
well-known interface for most intranet users.

Enabling Technology

e Empowering Users: Intranets act as technology
enablers, delivering domain-specific resources.

° Authentication Methods: User authentication can
occur through server permissions, database-based
techniques, firewalls, IP-based verification, or a com-
bination of these.

° Key Technologies: Employed technologies encom-
pass databases (e.g., Access, SQL Server, MySQL),
XML, HTML or XHTML-based forms, and web script-
ing (e.g., ASP, PHP, ColdFusion).

° A foundational understanding of computers can be
advantageous for users.

Core Features of Intranets

° Shared Folders: A fundamental intranet often com-
prises shared folders linked to the network, their vis-
ibility depends upon the user’s permission levels.

e The Knowledge Sharing is facilitated through ease
of access and use, universal information access for
small businesses, person-to-person interaction, and
some informal networks.

Extranets: Extending the Reach

° Extranets are a similar concept to intranets, but their
implementation differs.

° An extranet is also a controlled, private network that
extends beyond a company’s internal boundaries,
allowing geographically dispersed employees, such as
partners, clients, or suppliers, to connect securely.

° Extranets provide authorized users with access to lim-
ited resources, enabling secure collaboration with an
organization.

Network TorpoLocy

The network topology plays a critical role in the design
and implementation of both intranets and extranets. It
influences how devices are connected, data flows, and
how security and access controls are managed within
these private networks, that is mainly the arrangement

of cables, computers, and other peripherals. They play an
important role in workstations or nodes within computer
systems. The main categories of Network topologies are
as follows:

1. Bus Topology: In this configuration, each computer
is connected to a central (single) cable, similar to a
bus.

2. Star Topology: This topology features a central

hub or switch box to which all workstations connect

directly.

Ring Topology: In a ring topology, each device is con-

nected to exactly two neighbouring devices, forming

a closed loop.

4. Mesh Topology: Every computer in a mesh topology
is connected to every other computer, enabling mes-
sages to take multiple paths.

5. Tree Topology: A tree topology is a hybrid structure
that combines two or more star networks into a more
complex arrangement.

6. Hybrid Topology: This could be a combination of any
of the above, showing interconnections between dif-
ferent types of topologies, like a star connected to a
bus topology.

Computer Virus

A computer virus is like a sneaky, bad software program
called ‘malware.’ It can harm our computer in different
ways. Here’s we can see what they can do:

e Harm Data: Viruses can damage or delete your com-
puter’s programs and files.

e Quick Replication: They’re like speedy copy
machines, creating duplicates of themselves.

e Widespread Damage: They spread to different areas,
harming your computer’s data, even the ‘boot’ section
of your hard drive. .

How Do Viruses Enter Into the Systems?

1. Downloading Files: When you download stuff from
the internet.
2. Removable Media: Like USB drives, which might
- carry viruses.
3, Pen Drives: Be cautious with pen drives; they can
spread viruses.

apter g:

4. Mail Attachments:
might invite viruses.

5. Unpatched Software: Using software that hag
been updated can make your computer vulnerabje

6. Weak Passwords: Simple or unprotected Passwor,
can let viruses in.

Types of Viruses

Viruses cover a wide range of behaviours and characterig
tics, but the world of cybersecurity is ever-evolving. Ney
types of viruses and malware are continuously being dey,
oped by malicious actors. The common types are as follow.

File Infector Viruses: These viruses attach themselves tg
executable files, such as .exe or .com files. When we ryp
an infected program, the virus spreads to other files ang
can also propagate to other computers when we share
those files. They act surreptitiously, hiding within seey,
ingly normal files.

1. Simple Virus: Think of these viruses as sneaky troy.
blemakers that focus on program files, like the so
ware you use. They spread when you run a specific
program. It’s like a hidden surprise inside a gift box,
and the surprise isn’t good!

2. Encrypted Virus: Encrypted viruses are like digita|
spies. They infect different kinds of files but act just like
secret agents, hiding within files to avoid being caught.

3. Polymorphic Virus: These viruses are like ‘shape.
shifters’ in a spy movie. They can hide inside files,
especially those important executable files. They con-
stantly change their appearance to stay hidden, just
like secret agents trying to disguise themselves.

4. Bombs: Imagine these viruses as time bombs. They
can infect and hide inside specific types of files, and
they only go off at a particular time. It’s like a ticking
time bomb in your computer!

5. File Infector Virus: This virus is a true secret agent.
It directly targets and hides within executable files,
like those with extensions .exe or .com. They sneak
around like spies in your computer files. :

The other types are also given below, although they also
function as secret viruses.

1, Macro Computer Virus: These are like tiny trouble:

making agents hiding inside your computer files.

They can quickly spread, especially in programs like

Microsoft Word and Excel. It’s as if they wear a dis-

guise to blend in with your work.

Trojan Horse: These tricky viruses pretend to be

harmless, just like a gift that looks nice on the outside

but has something bad inside. They are often called

‘Social Engineering Viruses’ because they trick you

into letting them in. ,

3. Worms: These viruses are like speedy messengers
that move from one computer to another, causing
chaos as they go. They are often known as ‘network
viruses’ because they travel through computer net
works, much like how germs can spread from person
to person.

Boot Sector Computer Virus
- Aboot sector virus is a type of malicious software
or malware. These focus on infecting the boot
record of digital storage devices. They affect com-
puter’s hard disk, DVDs, CDs, and floppy disks.

» Boot sector viruses can be introduced to a com-
puter at any time. However, they only become
active when the computer’s boot record is
accessed or executed during the startup process.

e Once activated, these viruses are notoriously dif-
ficult to remove as they embed themselves deep
within the system.

e With the reduced, the presence of boot sector
viruses has declined over time with use of floppy
disks and changes in technology.

_ Master Boot Record Virus

¢ Infects the critical Master Boot Record on a hard
drive.

e They overwrite MBR code, they seize system con-
trol on boot.

¢ They spread through bootable media, like USB
drives.

¢ Their removal is more challenging, often requir-
ing specialized tools.

The above two Boot and Master Boot viruses are called
‘system-level viruses’.

Figure 8.8 Internet Basic Elements

Basic Internet Mechanism

° Internet relies on the Transmission Control Protocol/
Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).

* Data transmission requires an address and a secure
way to move electronic signals.

° TCP and IP are the fundamental protocols for sending
and receiving data.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

° Divides data into packets for sending and receiving.
° Specifies rules for reassembling data and ensuring
damage-free delivery.

IP (Internet Protocol)

e Adds destination addressing information to data
packets.

® The address is written as user@host.domain.

° Hosts are individual machines whose resources are
shared among users.

° Every host and router on the internet has an IP address.

IP Address

* Consists of four sets of numbers separated by dots.

® Each part is anumber from 0 to 255.

° DNS (Domain Name Server) assigns names to IP
addresses.

° IP addresses are organized from left to right.

IP Versions

° IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses.
° . IPv6, developed in 1995, uses 128-bit addresses.
° IPv12 is seen as a protocol of the future.

Other Internet Protocols

1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Defines com-
munication format between web browsers and servers

2. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol): Formats
communication between email servers and clients.

3. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer): Transmits private doc-
uments securely.

4. FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Standardizes file
transmission formats.

5. TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol}: Allows file
transfer between network devices. ‘

6. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Exchanges
network-based emails.

7. Telnet: Connects a computer with a remote host on
the internet.

8. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Formats
web page appearances and creates hypertext links.

9. OSI (Open Systems Interconnection): Describes

the seven-layer model for network communication.

SSL/TLS: SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) is cru-
cial for securing internet communications and is widely

used to protect data transmitted over the Internet, they
are not part of the fundamental set of Internet protocols

like HTTP, TCP/IP, DNS, or SMTP. SSL and TLS operate at.

the transport layer to provide secure communication over
existing Internet protocols.

ommunication between networks with different proto-
ols, converting one into another. Hardware examples of
ateways include connectors, cables, adapters, circuits,

nd switches.

NTERNET Service Proviper (ISP)

LISP is a company that offers a subscription service to
low individuals or organizations to connect to the inter-
et. ISPs have a network of computers that are always
inked to the internet. Some {SPs also provide dedicated
nes for a more reliable connection. Additionally, ISPs
ffer email addresses and website space on the World
ide Web (WWW).

AIN INTERNET CONNECTION OPTIONS

© connect to the internet, you can choose from several
chnology options:

. Dial-wp Connection: This uses an analog telephone
line to establish a temporary connection. It converts
a computer’s digital signals into analog signals.
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) can be
used for this purpose without a modem. This type is
referred to as ‘wired ether.’

. Cable TV Connections: Homes with cable TV can use
a cable modem for internet access.

. Digital Subscriber Line (DSL): DSL operates over
regular copper telephone lines. There are two types:

8.27

G@ Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) offers
different bandwidths for upstream and downstream
data. Gii) Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL)
provides the same bandwidth in both directions.

_ 4, Satellite Connection: This is similar to receiving TV

signals directly from a satellite.

5. Bluetooth: Bluetooth is a wireless technology that
enables data exchange over short distances, typically
within about 30 feet. It allows wireless communica-
tion between computers, cell phones, and other elec-
tronic devices.

6. Broadband: Broadband utilizes various high-capac-
ity transmission technologies to transmit data, voice,
and video over long distances at high speeds. It com-
monly uses coaxial cables, fiber optic cables, and radio
waves. Broadband connections are always active
and do not require dial-up. In 2021, India’s Telecom
Regulatory Authority proposed a minimum speed of
2 Mbps for broadband connections.

7. WiFi (Wireless Fidelity}: WiFi, also known as high-
frequency wireless local area networks (LAN), enables
wireless data transmission within a local area. Many
places like hotels, educational institutions, railways,
and airports offer WiFi access. It supports different
IEEE standards and can be used for various types
of networks, including LAN, MAN, PAN, and WAN.
WiMax is another wireless technology used to provide
internet services, including mobile data and hotspots.

8. Leased Line: A leased line is a dedicated data con-
nection with a fixed bandwidth. Organizations use
it to connect to the internet securely arid efficiently.
Leased lines offer maximum download capacity and
reliability. They are symmetrical, uncontended (can-
not be shared), and point-to-point.

Fiber optic internet, capable of reaching speeds up
to 940 Mbps, is another broadband connection option
known for low latency.

INTERNET Basics

The internet is like a superhighway for information. It
allows you to access specific data stored on various com-
puters worldwide. This system was created in the 1970s,
and it’s made up of different components. The most well-
known part of it is the World Wide Web (WWW), which is
different from the entire internet.

Woartp Wine Wes (WWW)

The WWW was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989
while he was working at CERN. WWW is based on three
key technologies: HTML, URL, and HTTP, which are
essential for the web as we know it today. The public ver-
sion of the WWW started in 1993.

CERN In General - CERN is a top European research
organization in Geneva, known for high-energy physics
research. Notably, they developed the LHC (Large Hadron
Collider), the world’s largest particle accelerator. CERN’s
work advances our understanding of fundamental par-
ticles and physics, including the 2012 discovery of the
Higgs boson.



=== Page 48 ===
Web Browsers

We use web browsers to explore the WWW. These are
like special tools that help us interact with the internet.
They retrieve information from the web and show it to us.
Popular examples are Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox,
Opera, and Safari.

Bookmarks

Web browsers allow you to bookmark your favourite web-
sites, so you can easily revisit them.

Domain Name

Domain names are the unique names that identify web-
sites on the internet. They typically have a suffix like ‘com’
for commercial sites or ‘edu’ for educational ones.

1. .com: Commercial institutions or organization
.edu: Educational institutions

.gov: Government sites

«mil: Military sites

net: Gateways and administrative hosts

.org: Private organizations

Domain Name Server (DNS): Mapping Domain
Names to IP Addresses

A DNS server translates domain names (such as google.
com) into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (such as
192.168.1.1). IP addresses are the ‘numerical addresses’
that are assigned to all devices connected to the Internet.
Thus, DNS servers are essential for navigating the inter-
net because they allow our computers to find and com-
municate with websites by their human-readable domain
names instead of needing to remember numerical IP
addresses.

How DNS Servers Work?

i. When you type a website’s domain name (like www.
example.com) into your web browser, your browser asks

a DNS server for the IP address linked to that domain.

* The DNS server first checks if it knows the IP
address from before (in its cache). If it does, it
provides the IP to your browser.

e If the DNS server doesn’t have the IP in its cache, it
will ask other DNS servers until it finds the correct IP.

2. Once the DNS server gets the right IP address, Yo
browser uses it to connect to the web server (whe
the website is stored).

* Your browser then requests the specific contey,
you want from the web server.

* The web server sends that content back to you,
_browser, which shows it on your screen.

Home Page

The home page of a website is like the book’s title Page
and table of contents. It acts as an index to all the content
on the site, similar to how a book’s table of contents listg
what’s inside. This page identifies the site and has links
to other pages within the website, accessible using a we
browser like Microsoft Explorer.

Hyperlinks

A hyperlink is an element in a web page that facilitates
navigation to another web page or to another part of the
same web page.

Web pages are filled with links, which can be under
lined or a different colour. When you click one, it takes
you to another part of the same page or a different page.

Firewall

A firewall is a software program that protects your com-
puter from unauthorized access, while connected to the
internet. It keeps an eye on the data going to and from
your computer and warns you about anything suspicious.

Search Engines

A search engine is a website that allows you to search for
information on the WWW. They look for keywords in doc-
uments and show you a list of pages where those words
are found. Some popular search engines include Google,
Bing, and Yahoo.

Meta Search Engines

Meta Search Engines save time by searching multiple
search engines at once. It is like a search tool that asks
many other search engines for help. It collects the results
and shows them together in one list.

Wide Area Information Server (WAIS) is a system on
the internet. It makes special databases about different.
subjects. These databases are on many servers. WAIS _
keeps track of them. ,

Some examples of Meta Search Engines are All4one

Email is a method of sending text messages between com-
puters over the internet. It’s a fast and secure way of com-
munication, more efficient than traditional mail. Email
provides a timestamp for messages, organizes conversa-
tions, and is easy to save.

Email Address Structure: An email address consists of
three parts:

1. Username: The chosen name for the email.
2. @ Symbol: Separates the username from the domain.

3. Domain: Indicates the email server’s location, includ-
ing the mail server and top-level domain (e.g., .com).

Types of Email Services: Email services are typically
divided into three categories:

1. Free Web-based Email: Commonly used and acces-
sible through web browsers.

2. Priced Web-based Email: Premium accounts offer-
ing extra features.

3. Private Email: Used by organizations with their own
mail servers, providing accounts to members.

Email Structure and Features: Emails have two main parts:

* Header: Contains sender, receiver, subject, and other
details.

° Body: The actual message text. Emails can be saved,
have reminders set, use spellcheck, and support
attachments. Folders help organize messages, and fil-
ters sort them automatically.

Functioning of Email Systems

1. Protocols: The most essential manages email
retrieval and viewing from a server, and facilitates
access across multiple devices. SMTP handles email
sending and delivery between clients and servers.

2. Delivery Agent: Mail Server functions as an interme-
diary in email systems, this processes and forwards
emails. There are features such as email storage, fil-
tering, and automatic responses.

3. Access Client: Email Clients such as Gmail or
Microsoft Outlook, provide the user interface for
accessing and managing emails. They support func-
tions like reading, composing, and storing messages.

Instant Messaging: Instant messaging is real-time com-
munication involving text, audio, or video:

° This includes chat, chat rooms, file sharing, and
mobile capabilities.

NMiosite Apps

Mobile apps simplify tasks with a simple click for most
users. To tech-savvy individuals, they are software appli-
cations designed to run on mobile devices like iPhones,
smartphones, and tablets. Apps are broadly classified into
two categories:

1. Web Apps: These apps are accessed through a web
browser over the internet, such as Google Chrome or
Mozilla Firefox. They are functional, interactive, and
don’t require downloads. Web apps use standard web
technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They
can run on any device with a web browser, regardless
of the operating system.

2. Mobile Apps: Mobile apps can be divided into two types:
° Native Apps: These apps are specifically designed for
particular platforms like iOS, Android, or Windows.
They are more complex compared to web apps and
require separate development for each platform.
¢ Hybrid Apps: Hybrid apps combine features of
both native and web apps. They are installed like
native apps but offer a web app-like experience.
Hybrid apps are built using JavaScript, HTML,
and CSS and utilize a simplified browser within
the app (known as a web view).

Virtual ConFrerRENCcING MetHops

Virtual conferencing methods enable individuals and groups
to connect and collaborate remotely. They encompass audio
conferencing, video conferencing, and teleconferencing. Let
us explore each of these methods in more detail:

Audio Conferencing

e Audio conferencing is a computer-based communi-
cation system that allows users in different locations
to hold virtual meetings where they can hear one
another, simulating real in-person conferences.

e Multiple callers can join an audio conference by dial-
ing into a conference bridge and using access num-
bers and conference IDs.

° Itoffers cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and time-sav-
ing advantages but lacks visual interactions, which
can lead to potential distractions.

e The two most common codecs used are G.711 and G.729.
G.711 is a wideband codec that provides high-quality
audio, but it requires more bandwidth. G.729 is a nar-
rowband codec that uses less bandwidth, but it also
provides lower-quality audio.

e Audio conferencing bridges can be either hardware-
based or software-based. Hardware-based bridges are
typically more expensive, but they offer better perfor-
mance and scalability. Software-based bridges are less
expensive, but they may not be as reliable or scalable.

Video Conferencing

e Video conferencing enables participants at different loca-
tions to conduct virtual conferences where they can see
and hear each other, as if they were in the same room.



=== Page 52 ===
8.32

° It involves endpoints like cameras and microphones,
an MCU (multi-point control unit or server), and
network connections. During a point-to-point video
call, participants’ voices and images are converted
from analog to digital and back to analog when sent
through the software.

e Codecs like H.264 and VP8 are commonly. used to
compress and decompress video signals.

* Video conferencing bridges can be hardware-based
or software-based, with hardware bridges being pre-
ferred for high-quality video.

® Video conferencing requires a higher bandwidth than
audio conferencing.

Note that audio conferencing is typically more toler-

ant of network latency than video conferencing. This is

because video conferencing requires a constant stream of
data to be transmitted in real time.

Teleconferencing

° This technology combines audio and video confer-
encing to connect participants via telephone or video
communication.

e Main Protocols: Three basic protocols include:

1. SIP (Session Initiation Protocol): This signal-
ling protocol is used to establish, modify, and ter-
minate teleconferencing sessions.

2. RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol): This trans-
port protocol is used to transmit audio and video
data between participants.

3. RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol):
This control protocol is used to monitor the qual-
ity of the teleconferencing session and to provide
feedback to the participants.

¢ Teleconferencing software includes the following:

1. Open source software: Examples are
FreeSWITCH and Asterisk to create and manage
teleconferencing systems.

2. Commercial software: Examples are Microsoft
Skype for Business and Cisco Webex.

° It is used by organizations like the UNHCR, which
employs tools like Skype for Business and Cisco WebEx
to facilitate remote communication and collaboration.

These virtual conferencing methods break down geo-
graphical barriers, making it easier for individuals and
organizations to connect, share information, and conduct
meetings without the need for physical presence. This is
used for business meetings, training sessions, educational
seminars, and social gatherings.

HD (High Definition) and SD (Standard
Definition)

The main difference between HD and SD videos is the res-
olution, impacting the video quality, file size, and band-
width requirements.

HD (High Definition): HD video offers a higher reg,
tion than SD. This means that the picture is clearey E
more detailed.

SD (Standard Definition): SD video has a lower rego
tion than HD. The most common SD resolution is 486
with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels.

°

Video Uploading and Downloading
The main points are as follow:

1.

id

Other points are privacy, security, storage space afl
device capability (such as smartphones, tablets, compu
ers).

Common HD resolutions include 720p and 10g
where the number refers to the vertical pixels

example, 1080p has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixel
HD video requires more storage space and bandwj
for streaming compared to SD due to the large;
size.

While SD video is not as sharp and detailed as HH
requires less storage space and bandwidth, makin,
a practical choice for slower internet connections 9
limited storage capacity.
SD has been the standard for many years, particular}
in traditional broadcasting, but it’s increasingly bein,
replaced by HD.

File Size and Format:
e There is longer time taken by larger, high-quali
video files (HD, 4K) to upload or download tha;
the smaller, standard definition files.
e File ‘size and compatibility with different pl
forms is influenced by video format such as MP.
AVI.

Internet Connection Speed:
¢ The speed of upload/download process depe
upon the speed of internet connection.
¢ During high internet traffic times, the limite
bandwidth can slow down the process.

Platforms and Services:
e Platforms such as YouTube, Dropbox have thei
own rules and features for uploading and down:
loading that may depend upon file size limits an
support for various formats.
e¢ The speed may depend upon the service also.

Data Transfer Protocols: Protocols like FTP °
HTTP/HTTPS are used for secure file transfer, wit
HTTPS offering added security and data integrity.
Video compression: This reduces the file size bu
can affect quality. So, maintaining a balance betwee
data reduction and quality is important.
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): CDNs c@
enhance the speed and reliability of video download
by caching content in multiple geographical location:

Social media tools encompass a wide range of applica-
ns and platforms that facilitate online social interac-
ns and content sharing. Their categorical brief descrip-
tion is given here so that students get collective idea:

. Networking Platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn):
These platforms are used for connecting with friends,
family, and professional contacts. They offer features
like profile creation, news feed updates, messaging,
and group discussions.

Microblogging Sites (Twitter, Tumblr): These are
platforms where users post short messages, updates,
or other content such as images, videos, and links.
They are known for real-time information sharing
and are popular for news and trends.

Photo Sharing Apps (Instagram, Snapchat): These
tools focus on image and video sharing. Users can
post pictures and videos, often with various filters
and editing tools, and engage with others through
likes, comments, and reposts.

4. Video Sharing Platforms (YouTube, Vimeo): These
sites allow users to upload, share, and view videos.
They are widely used for entertainment, educational
content, and marketing.

Content Curation and Bookmarking (Pinterest,
Reddit): These platforms enable users to discover,
save, and share content based on their interests.
They often organize content into boards or specific
categories.

. Messaging Apps (WhatsApp, Telegram): These
are used for direct personal messaging, group chats,

of communication compared to public social media
platforms.

= 819.2 seconds or 819.2/60 minutes = 13.65 minutes

7. Blogging and Forum Platforms (WordPress,
Quora): These tools provide spaces for more extended
and detailed content, such as blog posts, and allow for
community discussions and Q&A sessions.

Each of these tools serves different purposes but com-
monly enhances digital communication, community
building, content sharing, and information dissemination
within the social media ecosystem.

In 1954, W. Howard Gammon wrote an e-government
research paper on the use of ICT for providing good gov-
ernance. Today, ICT, suchas the internet, SMS, and mobile
apps, are widely used to access information quickly and
cheaply. They are also used in education, banking, rail-
ways, and other government services.

E-governance is the use of ICT to support the admin-
istration or management of government. It is a way to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government
services. E-governance can also help to improve transpar-
ency and accountability, and to make government more
responsive to the needs of citizens.

The main components of e-governance include:

° Government-citizen interface: This includes online
services such as tax filing, passport applications, and
land record searches.

°¢ Government-government interface: This includes
the use of ICT to improve communication and col-
laboration between different government agencies.

* Government-business interface: This includes the
use of ICT to make it easier for businesses to interact
with the government, such as for online payments
and licensing.



=== Page 54 ===
8.34

e Government-employee interface: This includes the
use of ICT to improve the productivity and efficiency
of government employees.

e Government-society interface: This includes the
use of ICT to engage with citizens and to get their
feedback on government policies and programs.

Ficune 8.10 ICT’s Value in E-Governance

Benefits oF ICT-BASED GOVERNANCE
The benefits are as follows:

° Automation of administrative processes: ICT can
be used to automate numerous government pro-
cesses, such as tax collection and passport processing.
This can save time and money, and improve the effi-
ciency and accuracy of government services.

° Better service delivery: ICT can be used to improve
the delivery of government services by making them
more accessible and convenient for citizens. For
example, citizens can now access many government
services online, from anywhere in the world.

e Transparency and accountability: ICT can be used
to improve transparency and accountability by mak-
ing government information more accessible to citi-
zens. For example, governments can publish their
budgets and financial reports online, so that citizens
can see how their tax money is being spent.

e Citizen participation: ICT can be used to make it
easier for citizens to participate in government deci-
sion-making and service delivery. For example, gov-
ernments can use online surveys and forums to col-
lect feedback from citizens on policy proposals and
service delivery.

CHALLENGES OF E-GOVERNANCE
Despite the many benefits of e-governance, there are also

some challenges that need to be addressed. These chal-
lenges include:

e Lack of resources: Several government agencies do
not have the resources to implement and maintain
ICT-based systems.

e Lack of infrastructure: Many rural areas do not have
access to reliable electricity and internet connectivity.

° Digital divide: Not everyone has access to ICT tools
and resources.

° Security concerns: There are concerns about the
security of government data and systems.

° Reluctance to change: Some government employees

- may be reluctant to change their traditional ways of
working.

The government of India is committed to impleme
ing e-governance initiatives. Some of the key i initiative
include:

° e-Sampark centres: These centres provide citizen
with access to a variety of government services, suc
as bill payments, passport applications, and lan
record searches.

° Information Technology Act, 2000: This law estab
lishes the legal framework for e-governance in Ind
It recognizes online transactions with the govern
ment and gives them the same legal status as offli
transactions.

° india Image (Government of India Portal): T
website provides information about the governmen
of India and its various departments and agencies, I
also allows citizens to access a variety of governmeni
services online.

° Agricultural Marketing Information Networ
(AGMARKNET): This network provides farmers wi
information about agricultural prices and mark
conditions.

e Central Passport System: This system allows citi
zens to apply for passports online.

* Community Information Centres (CICs): These cen
tres provide rural communities with access to comput
ers and the internet. They also offer training on how
to use ICT for a variety of purposes, such as accessin
government services and finding information.

ICT works as a powerful tool that can be used t
improve governance. E-governance initiatives can hel
to make government more efficient, effective, transpar
ent, and accountable. They can also improve the deliver}
of government services and to make government mor
responsive to the needs of citizens.
