Education

DEFINITIONS AND MEANING OF EDUCATION

The concept of education is more important than teach-
ing because education encompasses the broader goals of
what we want to achieve with learning, while teaching
is focused on the specific methods and techniques used
to deliver instruction. So, we are starting our discussion
with education.

Education is the methodical and deliberate process
of acquiring knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and hab-
its, through teaching, training, or research. The scope of
education covers the transfer of knowledge across gen-
erations and the transformative impact of education on
individuals and society to produce responsible and pro-
gressive citizens. This covers their intellectual, social, and
personal growth through self actualization. The mission
of education also encompasses the promotion of equity,
cultural preservation, fostering a more inclusive and
interconnected society, environmental awareness and
economic empowerment.

Education takes place formally through schools, col-
leges and universities as well as informally through real-
world exposure and self-directed study.

Thus, education is a complex and multifaceted con-
cept. The different definitions of education have been
given as under:

Sri Rabindranath Tagore: The aim of education is self
realization. It means the realization of universal soul in
one’s self. It is a process which cannot be realized without
education. He synthesizes the ancient Vedantic.

Swami Vivekananda: Education is the manifestation
of perfection already in a man.

John Dewey: Education is preparation for life; educa-
tion is life itself.

Nelson Mandela: Education is the most powerful
weapon which you can use to change the world.

Malcolm Forbes: Education’s purpose is to replace an
empty mind with an open one.

Albert Einstein: Education is what remains after one
has forgotten what one has learned in school.

Aristotle: Education is the best provision for old age.
Thus, education is about facing challenges and opportu-
nities throughout the lives. Education is also creation of a
sound mind in a sound body.

Maria Montessori: Education is a natural process car-
ried out by the child and is not acquired by listening to
words but by experiences in the environment.

Benjamin Franklin: An investment in knowledge pays
the best interest.

B.F. Skinner: Education is what survives when what
has been learned has been forgotten.

Plato: Education is the kindling of a flame, not the fill-
ing of a vessel.

Horace Mann: Education, then, beyond all other
devices of human origin, is the great equalizer of the
conditions of men, the balance-wheel of the social
machinery.

EDUCATION PHILOSOPHIES

According to Will Durant, ‘science gives us knowledge,
but philosophy gives us wisdom’. Thus, philosophy helps
us to develop our values and to make wise decisions.

Ancient Bhartiya system was assumed to be focused
more gurukal, guru shishya culture, rote memorization,
academic rigor and discipline, we produced the best way
of life and architecture. The Western education system
seemed to be more flexible and develops problem-solving
skills. In this unit, we will focus more on Western system
and in the tenth unit, on Indian education system as per
the flow of syllabus.

Philosophy is a very vast subject, and education is
closely linked with it. All aspects of education, such
as aims, objectives, curriculum, teaching methods,
teacher, textbooks and discipline are influenced by
philosophy.

The educational process has three types of questions:
(a) ‘Why’ is decided by philosophy?
(b) ‘How’ is decided by psychology?
(c) ‘What’ is decided by the social needs?

Hence, education is based on philosophical, psycho-
logical, and social aspects. As per Western philosophy,
Socrates is considered to be the father of education.
(Plato was a student of Socrates. Aristotle was a student
of Plato).

The philosophical study of following concepts is impor-
tant, sometimes questions can be directly asked or some-
times they can be in the form of assertion - reason as well.

1. Ancient Education: This classical form of education
flourished in Ancient Greece and Rome, primarily
from around 5th century BCE to the early centuries
CE. There were the most develped Vedic education,
Jain and Buddhist in case of Bharat. The emphasis
was on the study of classical texts, including litera-
ture, philosophy, and mathematics. They focus on
developing moral character and civic virtue. There
was focus on the works of ancient philosophers, writ-
ers, and mathematicians such as Plato, Aristotle,
Socrates, Quintilian, the liberal arts were divided into
the following:

1. Trivium - grammar, rhetoric, and logic

2. Quadrivium - arithmetic, geometry, music, and
astronomy

Using the ‘dialectical method’, students debated and
engaged in Socratic discourse to better grasp subjects.
Ancient Bhartiya education system also focused on
timeless and universal ideas and knowledge that
included the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Puranas, and
the Bhagavad Gita. Our system was liberal and holistic
that focused on the development of knowledge, wis-
dom, and ultimately well rounded life. The literature,
philosophy, mathematics, and science were included
in it. It used Socratic method of teaching that involves
asking questions and leading students to discover the
truth for themselves.

2. Perennialism Form of Education (Early 20th
Century): Mortimer Adler and Robert Hutchins are
the main proponents of this approach. There is focus
on timeless and universal ideas and knowledge,
classics of literature, philosophy, and mathematics.
The emphasis was on liberal education and Socratic
method. It is assumed to be more rigid, the curricu-
lum is prescribed. It is more focused on transmission
of knowledge than being too much variable.

3. Essentialism and Existentialism (Mid-20th

Century): The essentialism and existentialism can
rather be assumed to be two contrasting viewpoints.
Essentialism: This was propounded by William
Bagley. Accordingly, there are essential, unchanging
truths, knowledge, and values that should form the
core of education. It believes in a structured, stan-
dardized curriculum that imparts these essential
knowledge and skills to students. Reality is seen as
objective and measurable.
Existentialism: This was propounded by Jean-Paul
Sartre. Accordingly, reality is subjective and experienced
differently by each individual. It emphasizes personal
experience, individual choice, and subjective under-
standing. Existentialists argue that knowledge is con-
structed through personal experiences and reflection.

4. Naturalism (Late 19th and Early 20th Century):
Sri Rabindranath Nath Tagore: The education which
does not help the child to discover and manifest his
own unique nature is not education at all.

Friedrich Froebel: Learning must take place in nature
and from nature.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Dewey are also the main
proponents of naturalism. Rousseau’s work, particu-
larly his book ‘Emile, or On Education, had a significant
influence on the naturalistic philosophy of education.
Naturalism in education means learning from nature
and real experiences. It’s like learning by doing things.
This involves the following:

1. Nature and Experience are Key: Learning
comes from nature and real-life experiences.

2. Related to Constructivism: This is about buiid-
ing your own understanding from experiences.

3. Hands-on Activities: Doing things like science
experiments and nature walks helps you learn.

4. Asking Questions and Exploring: Teachers help
you by making a place where you feel okay to ask
questions and look into things you like.

5. Learning from Each Other: You get to work
with others and learn from them too.

6. Real Examples: Like visiting a water treatment
plant to learn about the water cycle or studying
how plants grow in different conditions.

The Maria Montessori educational model has been
shown to be effective in helping children to develop a
wide range of skills, including academic skills, social
skills, and emotional skills. Montessori students are
often praised for their independence, creativity, and
problem-solving skills.

Naturalism is linked closely with progressivism.

. Progressivism and Pragmatism: This is a student-

centred approach to education that emphasizes the
importance of hands-on learning and experiential
activities. This is more linked with society. Children
learn the best by doing, and that they should be
given opportunities to explore their interests and
develop their own knowledge. John Dewey, William
Heard Kilpatrick, Jean Piaget are main proponents of
progressivism.

Pragmatism is linked with practicality. It emphasizes
the importance of practicality and problem-solving.
Pragmatists believe that the best way to learn is by
doing and by applying knowledge to real-world prob-
lems. They also believe that education should be rele-
vant to students’ lives and that it should prepare them
for success in the workplace.

. Theory of Cognitivism (Late 20th Century):

Understanding how the human mind processes infor-
mation and implications for effective teaching and
learning. Cognitive load theory addresses how the
cognitive load affects learning.
Cognitivism provides students with opportunities to
actively construct their own knowledge. Here, hands-
on activities and real-world examples are used to
illustrate the concepts. The students are provided
opportunities to actively construct their own knowl-
edge through mental processes of perception, mem-
ory, and problem-solving.

Jean Piaget’s theory of ‘cognitive development’ has

given the following terms in context of cognitive

psychology.

(a) Schemas: This is basically a mental framework
or structure that individuals use to organize and
make sense of information.

(b) Assimilation: Individuals incorporate new
information or experiences into their existing
mental structures or schemas. It involves fit-
ting new information into pre-existing cognitive
frameworks.

(c) Accommodation: This refers to the process of
modifying existing cognitive structures or sche-
mas to accommodate new information or experi-
ences. It occurs when individuals encounter infor-
mation that does not fit into their existing mental
frameworks, and they must adjust those frame-
works to make sense of the new information.

(d) Equilibration: This is the process of achieving
balance or equilibrium between assimilation and
accommodation. This is seen as a driving force in
cognitive development.

(e) Egocentrism: This is the tendency for young
children to view the world from their own per-
spective and have difficulty understanding the
perspectives of others.

(f) Object Performance: It is the understanding
that objects continue to exist even when they are
not visible,



=== Page 3 ===

1.4

(g) Conservation: Objects retain some of their prop-
erties even while their appearance changes.

Lev Vygotsky claimed that we are born with four ele-
mentary mental functions—attention, sensations, per-
ception and memory. He has given the concept of ‘zone
of proximal development’ (ZPD), where learning occurs
with the help of more knowledgeable individuals or peers.

Scaffolding is a teaching method that is based on the con-

cept of the ZPD. It involves providing temporary support

and guidance to learners as they work on tasks that are
slightly beyond their current level of competence.

Look at these also

(a) Probing: This is ‘asking questions’.

(b) Think out Aloud: This is actually verbalizing the
thoughts by learners as they work through a problem
or task. This helps to gain direct access to a person’s
thought processes and cognitive strategies.

7. Constructivist School of Thoughts (Mid-20th
century): Constructivism is a broader concept than
cognitivism. Learners actively build their own knowl-
edge and understanding through active engagement,
problem-solving, and experiences. The progression
from cognitivism to constructivism may not be linear
but full of variations.

Learning is an active process where students con-

struct their understanding of the world through inter-

action with their environment and peers. Learning is

personal and experiential. This is integration of new

experiences with previous ones.

Jean Piaget’s (1896-1980) work focused on the

stages of cognitive development and constructiv-

ism, while Lev Vygotsky’s (1896-1934) contribu-

tions centred on sociocultural theory and the role of

social interaction in learning that is called as ‘social

constructivism’.

Advanced Organiser’s Model (AOM) and Syntax:

Ausubel’s AOM reflects the holistic approach to learn-

ing in the following process:

1. Active engagement with material for in-depth
understanding.

2. Integrating new knowledge with existing mental
frameworks for cohesive learning.

3. Enhancing understanding through social
interactions.

4. Tailoring educational methods to individual
learning styles.

The mention of ‘mental models’ as organized pat-

terns, such as visual representations, highlights an

important aspect of Ausubel’s theory.

Though same in essence, Asubels’ Advance Organiser’s

Model has the three steps:

1. Introduction of the Advance Organizer: A
brief, general overview of the topic that connects
with students’ existing knowledge.

2. Presentation of the Learning Material: This
stage involves delivering the main content of the
lesson.

Chapter |

3. Reinforcement of Cognitive Organization:
Here, students reflect on their learning, linking
new information with their prior knowledge for
better understanding.

Jerome Bruner’s ‘Spiral Curriculum’: The students
repeatedly encounter key ideas and skills throughout
their education, and each time at a more complex level.
This enables them to expand and deepen their under-
standing of a subject based on what they already know.

Gandhian ‘basic education’ (Wardha Education sys-
tem) was founded on the belief that learning should be
a process of self-discovery and active participation rather
than passive reception of information. That is actually
linked with ‘constructivism’.

Discovery learning: This is an educational approach
where learners actively explore and experiment with con-
cepts, principles, and problem-solving tasks to construct
their own understanding and knowledge. This entails
active exploration and independence also.

8. Social Learning Theory: Albert Bandura’s theory
of learning and behaviour proposes that new behav-
iours can be acquired by observing and imitating oth-
ers, thus people learn through observation, imitation,
and modelling. We are also more likely to imitate
behaviours that are rewarded and less likely to imi-
tate behaviours that are punished.

For example, a child learns to ride a bike by watching
their parents ride bikes and a student learns to solve
math problems by watching their teacher solve math
problems.

This theory has been used to develop new teaching
methods, to treat phobias and other psychological
disorders, and to promote positive social behaviour.

9. Behaviorism (Early to Mid-20th Century): Learning
is simply defined as the modified behaviour. Learning
is a process of conditioning. It is the result of condi-
tioned responses to external stimuli. The emphasis
on observable behaviours through reinforcement and
rewards. The contribution of various behaviour the-
ory proponents has been mentioned below:

1. Ivan Pavlov’s (1849-1936) research on classical
conditioning involved pairing a neutral stimulus
(like a bell) with a reflex response (like saliva-
tion in dogs). This demonstrated that animals
(and humans) could form automatic, involuntary
responses to neutral stimuli when those stimuli
were consistently paired with significant events
through ‘associations’.

2. John B. Watson (1878-1958) had also given
the concept of classical conditioning, which
involves learning associations between stimuli
and responses. He conducted the famous ‘Little
Albert’ experiment, that is about learning of pho-
bias through classical conditioning.

3. The contribution of B.F. Skinner:

Operant Conditioning: This is also known as
‘skinner Box’. It is used to study animal behaviour

Teaching Aptitude

and operant conditioning in controlled environ-
ments. This emphasises learning through the
consequences of one’s actions. He proposed that
behaviours could be strengthened or weakened
based on whether they were followed by rein-
forcement (positive or negative) or punishment.
This theory has been applied in educational set-
tings to shape and modify student behaviour.
Programmed Instruction: This involves break-
ing down learning materials into small, sequenced
steps. Learners progress through these steps at
their own pace, receiving immediate feedback
and reinforcement. Programmed instruction was
one of the earliest forms of computer-assisted
learning and personalized learning.

Teaching Machine: Skinner also designed

‘teaching machines’, which are the mechanical

devices that provided students with a way to

answer questions or complete tasks, with imme-
diate feedback. These machines were intended to
make learning more efficient and individualized.

His book ‘Verbal Behavior’ (1957) explored the

behaviourist analysis of language and communica-

tion. He also gave the concept of ‘radical behaviour’.

4. Edward Lee Thorndike (1874-1949): He was
an American psychologist who made significant
contributions to the fields of psychology and
education.

He conducted extensive research on animal

behaviour, learning, and human intelligence. The

three primary laws he proposed are:

1. Law of Effect: Behaviours followed by posi-
tive outcomes (rewards) are more likely to be
repeated, while behaviours followed by nega-
tive outcomes (punishments) are less likely to
be repeated. The Law of Effect underlies the
concept of reinforcement in behaviourism.

2. Law of Readiness: Learners are more pre-
pared and motivated to learn when they are in
a state of readiness or when they have a natu-
ral, biological readiness for a particular type
of learning or behaviour.

3. Law of Exercise: Practice and repetition
strengthen the association between a stimulus
and a response, leading to increased efficiency
and readiness in performing that behaviour.

‘Drill and Practice’ is an educational method that
involves repetitive exercises or activities designed
to reinforce learning and promote skill mastery.
This is linked with Mathematics, Languages,
Science, Computer Programming, Music and
Arts, Standardized Tests, Skills Training etc.

10. Humanism (Mid-20th Century):

The main proponents were Abraham Maslow and
Carl Rogers. The Education should prioritize the
development of the whole person, including emo-
tional and psychological well-being, self-esteem, and
self-actualization.

Maslow has given five sets of needs — physiological,
physical, social, esteem and self actualization.
According to J. Krishnamurthi, the greatest revolu-
tion is not in changing the political system or the eco-
nomic system, but in changing the human mind and
heart.

Critical Pedagogy (Mid-20th Century):

The main proponent was Paulo Freire. Education
should empower students to critically analyse and
challenge social injustices and inequities, fostering
critical thinking and social change.

Connectivism (21st Century):

The main Proponent was George Siemens. As we
understand that learning in the digital age is charac-
terized by the connectedness of information and the
ability to network with others. Emphasis on the role of
technology and networks in learning.

Multicultural Education (20th Century):

This was propounded by Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
John Dewey, Rabindranath Tagore. The main propo-
nents were James A. Banks, Sonia Nieto. This aims at
promoting diversity,’ inclusivity, and the integration
of multiple cultural perspectives into the curriculum
and teaching practices.

Gestalt Psychology: This is a philosophy of education
that emphasizes the importance of holistic learning
and the integration of knowledge. Gestalt psycholo-
gists believe that people learn best when they are
able to see the whole picture and to understand how
the different parts of a problem or topic are intercon-
nected. Synergy is not explicitly a part of Gestalt psy-
chology, but it is a related concept, that is linked with
holistic learning. Synergy is the idea that the whole is
greater than the sum of its parts, thatis 2+ 2=5.

Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences:
Accordingly, there are nine different types of intel-
ligence, verbal-linguistic, _logical-mathematical,
visual-spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interper-
sonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic, and existential.
Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence is the ability to use
the body to express ideas and feelings and to solve
problems. Such people are often good at sports,
dance, and other activities that require physical
coordination.

Experiential Learning Theory (ELT): This model by
David Kolb is acomprehensive framework that describes
learning as a process where experience is transformed
into knowledge. It involves a four-stage cycle: start-
ing with Concrete Experience, followed by Reflective
Observation, then Abstract Conceptualization, and
finally Active Experimentation. This theory emphasizes
that effective learning is a continuous dynamic process
of experiencing, reflecting, thinking, and acting.

Eclecticism: While Kolb’s Model is rooted in ELT,
this eclecticism seems to be a broader and practical
approach. This is a mixed bag approach, it takes the
best from different educational traditions. It is a flex-
ible and adaptable approach that can be tailored to



=== Page 4 ===
1.6

the needs of individual students and groups. Eclectic
educators believe that no one philosophy or approach
can meet the needs of all students and contexts, so
they draw from a variety of sources to create effective
learning experiences.

David Kolb’s Model: We can take David Kolb’s Model
as an example of eclecticism. It draws on ideas from a
variety of different educational theories, including con-
structivism, behaviourism, and cognitive psychology.

1. Concrete Experience (CE): This stage involves
gaining new experiences. For instance, when
someone becomes an Assistant Professor after
passing the NET exam, they encounter new
teaching experiences in the college setting.

2. Reflective Observation (RO): During this
stage, learners reflect on their experiences
to gain a deeper understanding. This may be
termed as ‘review’. For an assistant professor,
this might involve reviewing their teaching
methods and assessing what’s effective or needs
improvement.

3. Abstract Conceptualization (AC): The learners
develop a general understanding of their expe-
riences and how they apply to other situations.
An assistant professor regularly applies their
teaching experiences to enhance their overall
practice.

4. Active Experimentation (AE): Learners test
their understanding by trying new approaches.
An assistant professor may innovate by exploring
new teaching methods and strategies.

CE and AC are defined as two learning modes and RO
and AE are defined as two learning experiences.

DACA stands for

* Diverging: This is the process of generating new ideas
and possibilities.

° Assimilating: This is the process of taking in new
information and ideas and understanding them.

* Converging: This is the process of using new informa-
tion and ideas to solve problems or create new things.

¢ Accommodating: This is the process of adapting to
new information and ideas, and changing your exist-
ing beliefs and ideas as needed.

FWTA stands for

* Feeling: This is the process of experiencing emotions
and sensations.

* Watching: This is the process of paying attention to
what is happening around you.

* Thinking: This is the process of using your mind to
process information and ideas.

* Doing: This is the process of taking action and put-
ting your thoughts and ideas into practice.

Benefits of Kolb’s Model: This model is cyclical in
nature. The learners have the some flexibility to enter at
any stage. Kolb’s Experiential Learning Model offers ben-
efits such as enhanced learning outcomes, customized
learning for diverse preferences, and the promotion of
critical thinking. Additionally, it encourages adaptability
and innovation through experiential learning.

Rote oF Swami VIVEKANANDA

Swami Vivekananda’s speeches at
the World’s Parliament of Religions
in Chicago in 1893 brought Indian
spirituality and philosophy to the
global stage. He was a disciple of
the Indian mystic Sri Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa. Belur Math was
founded by Swami Vivekananda
in 1897. His ideas on education
and spirituality received interna-
tional recognition and influence.
He emphasised on holistic and
value-based education, the integration of science and
spirituality, and the promotion of character development.
His ideas continue to shape educational philosophies and
institutions in India and around the world.

Forms oF EDUcATION
We can divide the education into three parts.
1, Formal

2. Informal
3. Non-formal

Integration of these three makes the education holistic
and comprehensive. These forms of education have been
discussed in Figure 1.1

We want that education by which character is
formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is

Havighurst and Neugarten have given two important
functions of the education system:

1. Amirror that reflects society as it is or to be the stabi-
lizer of the society.

2. An agent of social change or a force directed towards
implementing the ideas of society.

George Payne, a sociologist, has given three main
functions of education:

Emile Durkheim worked on structural functionalism that
means how does the society function. He focused on the
transmission of society’s norms and values as the major
function of society. The education was recognized as a
training for specialized roles (division of labour) that
also includes adopting some occupation for livelihood.
Education is required to perform the function of

(a) cultural transmission and enrichment
(b) acceptance and reformulation
(c) change and reconstruction

Two terms can be discussed here.

Enculturation: It is the process why the young generation
learns the traditional ways of society. This practice differs
from one society to another. Enculturation is formalized
through education.

Acculturation: It is the process through which a person
or group from one culture comes to adopt the practices
and values of another, while still retaining their own dis-
tinct culture. This concept has become important in an
increasingly globalized society.

cial for personal growth, social adjustment, and
happiness. The pace of knowledge creation has
accelerated.

7. Vocational Training: Education prepares individuals
for economic self-sufficiency and social efficiency.

8. Self-Actualization and Holistic Development:
Education aids in self-actualization, realizing one’s
potential in physical, mental, emotional, social, and
spiritual-moral aspects.

9. Harmonious Development: Education aims at draw-
ing out the best in individuals, encompassing body,
mind, and spirit, as per Gandhi’s perspective.

10. Moral and Character Development: Moral values
and virtues, such as truthfulness and honesty are
important educational goals.

Factors Determining Educational Aims

Education is mostly a planned and purposeful activity.
Educational aims are necessary in giving direction to
unique activities so that we become good citizens and
society a better place to live and progress.

1. Philosophy and Education: Both are interconnected.
Philosophy determines the aim of education and
serves as a means to propagate philosophical ideas.

2. Human Nature: Different philosophies shape how
human nature is perceived. For example, ideal-
ists view education as the unfolding of the divine in
humans.

3. Socio-Cultural Preservation: Education plays a role
in preserving and transmitting cultural heritage and
traditions across generations.

4. Religious Influence: Religious ideals, like ahimsa
and truth, have influenced education systems histori-
cally, as seen in Buddhism in ancient India.

5. Political Ideologies: Various political ideologies,
such as authoritarianism, liberalism, and democracy,
shape societies and their educational systems.

tic, moral, and aesthetic aspects of individuals.

| | Concept of Teaching

The main objective of effective teaching is learning, with
teachers as knowledge facilitators. National progress
relies on human resource development, requiring compe-
tent teachers to guide society. ‘Teaching aptitude’ assesses
candidates’ qualifications, intelligence, attitude, and skills
for the teaching profession.

1.9

| Teaching Aptitude | Aptitude

Teaching can be defined in the following ways:

1. Teaching is the purposeful direction and manage-
ment of the learning process.

2. Teaching is a process of providing opportunities for stu-
dents to produce relatively permanent change through
engagement in experiences provided by the teachers.

3. Teaching is a skilful application of knowledge, experi-
ence and scientific principles with an objective to set
up an environment to facilitate learning.

4, Teaching is a planned activity and effective teaching
depends on the following factors:
(a) How clearly the students understand what they
are expected to learn.
(b) How accurately their learning can be measured.

5. Teaching is a process in which the learner, teacher
and other variables are organized in a systematic way
to attain some predetermined goals.

6. Teaching is an activity that influences a child to learn
and acquire desired knowledge and skills and also
their desired ways of living in the society.

J Basic Teaching Models

There is no basic model of teaching that fits into all situa-
tions. Basically, we have discussed two models—pedagogy
and andragogy—that are almost extremes of a teaching
continuum. Then there is heutagogy approach.

PEDAGOGY

Pedagogy involves teaching as both an art and a science,
with the teacher taking the lead in planning and execut-
ing lessons. Friedrich Herbart’s five step approach to ped-
agogy includes preparation, presentation, association,
generalization, and application of new knowledge.

ANDRAGOGY

Andragogy shifts the responsibility for learning to the
students, who interpret and discover knowledge at their
own pace. Instructors support this process by facilitating
learning opportunities and skill development, often asso-
ciated with adult learning.

HEUTAGOGY

Heutagogy focuses on highly autonomous, self-deter-
mined learning. It aims to prepare learners for com-
plex workplace challenges and includes ‘Double Loop
Learning’ as a key element.

Memory

LevVELS OF TEACHING

Teaching aims to make sure that learning happens
between the teacher (experienced) and student (inexpe-
rienced). There are three teaching levels: memory, under-
standing, and reflection, these three were suggested as
‘least thoughtful,’ ‘thoughtful, and ‘most thoughtful by
M L Biggie in 1976. Another stage, autonomous develop-
ment, is discussed first, as it occurs early in life.

Autonomous Development Level

This level is student-centered, with natural intellectual
development and minimal formal teaching. Teachers play
a less directive role, the role of a teacher is assumed to be
negative rather than positive. Some believe this approach
can continue into tertiary education. However, teacher
support remains vital, with educators needing flexibil-
ity and understanding of students’ personal and cultural
traits to create a supportive learning atmosphere.

] Memory Level of Teaching (MLT)

Memory Level of Teaching stands for the foundational
stage of learning, where the main focus is on memo-
rising and holding onto factual knowledge. Students
are expected to learn facts, concepts, and information
through this method without necessarily engaging in in-
depth comprehension or critical thought.

1. Factual Knowledge: At MLT, spreading factual
knowledge is our main priority. Learners are urged to
commit to memory and be able to quickly recall facts,
definitions, mathematical formulae, and other essen-
tial knowledge.

2. Teacher-Centred: At this level, the emphasis is usually
more on the teacher, and the teachers frequently serve
as the main material suppliers. They impart knowledge
via lectures, readings, and pre-planned lessons.

3. Rote Memory: Students repeat and recall material
through the use of flashcards, repetition, and mem-
ory drills as the main way of learning.

4. Testing Recall: The main goal of MLT’s assessment
procedures is to gauge pupils’ recall and memoriza-
tion skills. Multiple-choice questions, fill-in-the-blank
activities, and true-false tests are some common eval-
uation formats.

RoLe OF A TEACHER

1. Content Provider: Teachers are the primary source of
knowledge and content in MLT. They give students struc-
tured presentations of information, facts, and ideas.

2. Facilitator of Memory: Teachers assist students in
the process of memory by offering tips and tools to
aid in their retention of the necessary information.

3. Monitoring Progress: Teachers keep an eye on their
pupils’ memorization progress and may offer com-
ments and reinforcement as necessary.

Teaching Methods

1, Lecture-Based: Students usually receive information
from teachers through lectures and plan.

2. Drills and Practice, and Repetition: To improve stu-
dents’ memory of facts and information, repetition
and memorising drills are used. Reciting equations or
important phrases is one method for doing this.

Evaluation

1. Recall Assessment: Evaluation or assessment tech-
niques at the Memory Level concentrate on evaluat-
ing students’ recall and accuracy of knowledge repro-
duced from memory.

2. Objective Testing: Objective tésting styles, such as
multiple-choice questions, true-false statements,
and fill-in-the-blank exercises, are frequently used in
assessments.

3. Limited Critical Thinking: With little emphasis on
critical thinking or a deeper understanding of the
issue, the evaluation mostly focuses on evaluating
factual information.

PsycHotoaicat Bases of Memory Levet
OF TEACHING

1. According to theory of ‘cognitive development’, Jean
Piaget stated that memory level is meant for starters.
The learners are at the pre-operational level of cogni-
tive development in the school. They cannot operate
upon abstract concepts. As per their mental develop-
ment, they can learn simple concepts without analyz-
ing their true meaning and nature. Normally, they are
not expected to reflect upon the learnt facts.

2. Herbartian theory of apperception suggests that the
young pupil mind gets ready at this stage for perceiv-
ing themselves and the world around them. The brain
gets ready for a big mass of factual information. It
includes concepts, elements, structures, models and
theories. They can acquire and retain information
about a large number of things, objects, and material
through memorization.

3. In conditioning theory, Pavlov and Skinner advocated
that underlines the concept that correct response
made by an individual is strengthened by reinforce-
ment to retain the learned subject-matter longer and
to facilitate ease in further learning.

4. Pavlov’s classical conditioning applies the mechanical
process as applied in memory level of teaching; and
thorough review or retrieval, correct learning by the
student is rewarded and retained for future use.

SUGGESTIONS FOR Memory-Levet TEACHING

1. The teaching material should be objective and useful. -

“2. The teaching material should be finite and progress
from simple to complex.

3. Teaching aids should be adequate, and parts of the
content should be integrated and well-sequenced.

4. The subject matter should be presented in a system-
atic and organized manner.

5. There should be scope for continuous evaluation to mea-
sure improvement in the memory power of students.

6. The retention of the material in memory of students
can be increased by practice and exercise.

7. There should be scope for continuous reinforcement
during the course of instruction.

Understanding-Level of Teaching
(ULT)

Compared to the Memory Level, ULT is a stage of learning
that is more advanced. At this level, developing a deeper
grasp of the material takes precedence above merely
memorising information.

1. Consolidating Conceptual Understanding: ULT’s
primary goal is to improve conceptual comprehension.
Learners are urged to comprehend the underlying con-
cepts, principles, and links within the subject matter as
opposed to rote memorization of discrete facts.

2. The Teacher as a Guide: Although they still play a
significant part, instructors now act more as facilita-
tors and mentors than as the primary content sources.



=== Page 7 ===
1.12

| Chapter | I

They foster an environment that encourages concept
development and critical thought.

3. Application and Analysis: Learning at this level
involves applying knowledge to solve problems and
analysing complex scenarios. Students are challenged
to use their understanding of concepts to address real-
world situations.

4. Assessment of Understanding: At ULT, these methods
assess students’ grasp of the subject and their ability to
use what they've learned. Assessments may involve
essays, projects, presentations, and open-ended ques-
tions that demand deep analysis and critical thinking.

ROLe OF THE TEACHER

1. Guide and Facilitator: Rather than being the main
material suppliers, teachers at the Understanding
Level play a vital role as guides and facilitators. They
cultivate an atmosphere that promotes concept explo-
ration and critical thinking.

2. Encouraging Discussion: Teachers encourage student
interaction and discussion in order to motivate them to
think critically, ask probing questions, and go deeper
into the material. They encourage an environment
where students actively interact with the subject matter.

3. Supporting Application: Teachers help students
apply what they’ve learned to situations in the real
world. They might offer advice on how to apply their
expertise to resolve tricky situations or deal with rel-
evant challenges.

Teaching Methods

1. Interactive Learning: Teaching methods at the
Understanding Level emphasize interactive and partic-
ipatory learning. This may include group discussions,
debates, case studies, and problem-solving activities.

2. Socratic Questioning: Teachers use Socratic ques-
tioning techniques to encourage students to think
critically and arrive at solutions independently. They
pose open-ended questions that stimulate deep think-
ing and exploration.

3. Practical Application: Lessons often involve hands-
on experiences and practical applications of knowl-
edge. Students may engage in experiments, simu-
lations, or projects that allow them to apply their
understanding in real-life contexts.

Evaluation

1. Assessment of Comprehension: Assessment meth-
ods at the Understanding Level focus on evaluating
students’ comprehension and their ability to apply
their knowledge in meaningful ways.

2. Diverse Assessment Formats: Assessments may
take various formats, including essays, projects, pre-
sentations, and open-ended questions. These formats
require students to think critically, analyse, and syn-
thesize information rather than merely recalling facts.

3. Depth of Understanding: Assessments aim to gauge
the depth of students’ understanding. This involves
examining their ability to explain concepts, analyse
situations, and draw meaningful conclusions.

Piaget’s theories are highly relevant at the
‘Understanding’ stage. He emphasized that learners
progress through different stages of cognitive develop-
ment, from concrete operational to formal operational.

@ Reflective Level of Teaching (RLT)

<a

True teachers are those who help us think for
ourselves.
— Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan

RLT emphasizes critical thinking over memorization.
Students gain deep understanding and independence.
Teachers play an important role of guides. Assessments
evaluate comprehension and critical thinking. Piaget’s
theories support critical thinking and self-reflection.

1. Critical Thinking: Emphasis on developing critical
thinking skills and deeper understanding. They learn
to question assumptions, identify biases, and develop a
more profound comprehension of the subject matter.

2. Student-centred: RLT encourages self-directed
learning, with teachers as facilitators and guides. This
fosters ownership among students, they take respon-
sibilities and they are motivated towards the tasks.

3. Discussion and Analysis: The learning takes place
through discussions, analysis, and reflection. The
learners are engaged in dialogues with peers and
teachers, they share diverse perspectives, and criti-
cally examine ideas. This interactive approach pro-
motes a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

4. Testing Understanding: Traditional testing methods
like multiple-choice questions may be supplemented
or by assessments such as essays, projects, presenta-
tions, and open-ended questions. Assessment focuses
on evaluating comprehension and critical thinking.

ROLE OF A TEACHER

1. The teacher plays the role of a facilitator and guide
rather than a primary content provider.

2. Encourages students to question, analyse, and reflect
on the material.

3. Supports students in developing their own perspec-
tives and opinions.

Teaching Methods

1. Emphasizes discussions, debates, and group activities
that encourage critical analysis.

2. Encourages students to explore topics independently
and conduct research.

3. Promotes problem-solving and application of knowl-
edge to real-life situations.

Evaluation

1. At this level, evaluation or assessment techniques
concentrate on gauging pupils’ understanding, criti-
cal thinking, and application skills.

2. They might consist of open-ended questions, projects,
essays, and presentations.

Teaching Aptitude f

1.13

3. Students must show that they have a thorough com-
prehension of the material and the capacity to analyse
it critically.

Examples - At MLT, students are introduced to the
basic concept that Earth attracts objects towards itself
due to gravity.

At ULT, there are Newton’s and Einstein’s Law of
gravity where different variables are involved. Teachers
explain them with the help of formulae.

At RUT, we can see the example of space mission, objec-
tives etc., how Chandrayaan 3 left the gravitational pull of
earth and that shifted towards the gravity of moon. They
delve into critical thinking about the mission’s impact on
lunar science, space exploration, and India’s space program.

Merits oF ReFctective LEVEL TEACHING

1. The teaching at this level is learner-centered.

2. There is more interaction between the teacher and
the learner.

3. This level of teaching is appropriate for the higher class.

Demerits oF ReFctective LEVEL TEACHING

1. Itis mostly suitable for mentally mature children.
2. The study material is neither organised nor pre-
planned or systematic.

The concepts of cognition and metacognition as they are
linked with reflective practices.

Metacognition: This is a subdivision of cognition, or
a type of cognition, Metacognition is defined as the
scientific study of an individual’s cognitions about his or
her own cognitions. It is basically application part.

Cognition: This is a mental process that includes memory,
attention, producing and understanding language, reason-
ing, learning, problem-solving and decision-making.

It is often referred to as information processing, apply-
ing knowledge, and changing preferences. It is something
that is more basic.

Dynamic ENVIRONMENT

Effective teaching relies on dynamic communication.
Teaching adapts to different contexts, influenced by three
key factors:

1. Independent variables: Teachers possess the auton-
omy to influence student behaviors.

2. Dependent variables: Students rely on teachers for
their learning.

3. Mediating or Intervening variables: These include
teaching methods, instructional facilities, and motiva-
tional techniques. Mediator variables suggest that the
independent variable affects the mediating variable,
which subsequently impacts the dependent variable.

According to Ronald T. Hyman, effective teaching involves
a dynamic interaction between the teacher, the learner, and
the subject matter. Education is a tripartite process involving
students, teachers, and the social environment.

Teaching is a Complex whole

Teaching is a complex process that involves various tech-
niques, methods, and media, including questioning,

exemplifying, and more. The effectiveness of teaching
depends on choosing and utilizing suitable techniques
and media, making it a multifaceted endeavor.

Teaching Visualizes Change in Behaviour

The changes as discussed in cognitive domain (knowl-
edge), affective domain (attitude, motivation) and psycho
motor domain (physical skills) are tentatively permanent.
The changes that occur in learners need not to be performa-
tive but rather improve the potential ability of the learners.

Teaching can be Direct or Indirect

(a) Direct methods: Here, teachers use methods,
such as lecture, demonstration, etc. and engages
students in face-to-face interaction.

(b) Indirect teaching: Here, active teaching meth-
ods, such as role-play, project, assignment,
inquiry or other such activities are applied. They
are basically learner-centred methods where the
involvement of learners is higher.

These methods have been discussed in the concept box.

In case we want to look at the teacher, learner,
curriculum, physical conditions (climate), the fol-
lowing scenarios emerge, starting from bipolar to
quadrilateral.

Teaching can be vertical or horizontal

Vertical teaching goes deep into a topic and focuses on

higher-order thinking skills like analysis, synthesis, evalu-

ation, and creation.
Horizontal teaching covers multiple areas across vari-

ous topics without going too deep into one specific subject.

Teaching can be planned or unplanned

In traditional teaching, educators plan the content, meth-
ods, and evaluation in advance.

With active learning methods, planning is less strict, as
it is not always clear beforehand how to organize teaching
and learning activities.

An Overview of Training, Development,
Instruction and Indoctrination

Training: Training is a concise, systematic, and organ-
ized process aimed at imparting technical knowledge and
specific skills to students or non-managerial personnel. It
serves a defined, short-term purpose, often related to a spe-
cific job. For example, when a teacher joins an institution,
they undergo ‘induction training’ to acquaint themselves
with the institution’s rules, regulations, and policies.

Development: Development represents a long-term, con-
tinuous educational process, systematically designed for
managerial personnel. It focuses on imparting conceptual
and theoretical knowledge with broad applicability. This
educational approach involves philosophical and theo-
retical concepts, aiming for long-term development in
managerial roles.

Instruction: Instruction is the act of teaching and engag-
ing students with content. It encompasses how a teacher
organizes time and activities to implement curriculum
and learning plans effectively.

Indoctrination: Indoctrination represents the highest
level of teaching, where beliefs and ideas are instilled
in others. It often involves a deliberate inclusion of
certain ideologies in teaching. While teaching can
exist without indoctrination, indoctrination inherently
involves teaching.

Teaching as Intellectual Activity

Teaching is fundamentally a cognitive activity. It neces-
sitates conscious and ongoing organization of learning
activities, creating a supportive learning environment.
To achieve desired changes in learner behavior, teachers
must develop suitable action plans, considering the var-
ied expectations of their students.

Teaching as a Science and an Art

The teaching profession draws from a systematic body of
knowledge derived from various realms, including social,
psychological, historical, political, and economic aspects.
It is also influenced by societal religious, spiritual, and
ethical beliefs. Teaching techniques follow systematic
steps and can be communicated effectively. Teacher train-
ing is often based on scientific assumptions and method-
ologies.

Simultaneously, teaching is an art. It unfolds in a
dynamic environment where teachers must navigate
individual differences among students with tact. This
demands an individualized approach and discretion to
foster effective learning. Teaching blends scientific prin-
ciples with creative and adaptable practices, making it
both a science and an art.

SELF ORGANIZATION

The people in teaching profession are sensitive towards
growth and development because it is self-organized.
They evolve a definite mechanism to sustain and promote
the standards of the teaching profession. The growth in
teaching profession is organic in nature, i.e., the growth
happens in a spontaneous manner.

Sociat SERVICE

It has been accepted that education is a potent tool to
bring about changes in any nation. It is useful to develop
the society.

HicgH DEGREE of AUTONOMY

Teachers have a lot of independence in their work, includ-
ing creating the curriculum, planning lessons, setting
goals, choosing teaching methods and materials, assess-
ing students, and organizing extracurricular activities.
This autonomy is distinct from the independence that stu-
dents have in their learning.

TEACHING AS A PROFESSION

Teaching is the profession that enables all other profes-
sions to exist. To become a teacher, you typically need to
complete courses like B.Ed or M.Ed, which provide the
necessary knowledge and skills. It involves several years
of studying and occasional training. Teachers often need
to further their education to advance in their careers.

ie Objectives of Teaching

An objective describes an intended result of instruction
rather than the process of instruction itself. A good objec-
tive should be specific, outcome based (i.e., it should
emphasize on the output rather than the process of
instruction) and should be measurable.

The objectives of teaching and learning must integrate
at the end of the instruction.

There are two main ways of classifying instructional
objectives. One classification is given by Bloom, whereas
another classification is given by Gagne and Briggs.

Bloom’s Classification of Teaching
and Instructional Objectives

According to this classification, instructional objectives
fall under one of the following three categories:

1. Cognitive Domain: This is the fundamental domain
of learning, focusing on the development of intel-
lectual capabilities, encompassing thinking and

Teaching Aptitude

1.15

knowledge. The cognitive domain serves as the

foundational platform for the other domains (affec-

tive and psycho-motor). Key points within the cog-

nitive domain include:

1, Knowledge: Involves the recall of information
and content.

2. Comprehension: Concerns the ability to under-
stand the meaning of materials.

3. Application: Transforms abstract knowledge into
practical use.

4. Analysis: Deconstructs information into its con-
stituent parts to facilitate better understanding.

5. Synthesis: Combines these constituent parts to
create a cohesive whole, contrasting with analysis.

6. Evaluation: Involves making judgments about
the suitability of methods and materials for spe-
cific purposes.

Anderson and Krathwohl enhanced Bloom’s
taxonomy, reorganizing it for better cognitive
learning. The revised structure includes:

1. Remembering: Recalling prior knowledge

2. Understanding: Grasping and articulating con-
cepts in one’s own words.

3 Applying: Using knowledge in new contexts
(may be called as abstraction). Apply what
was learned in the class room into real-world
situations.

4. Analyzing: Breaking down complex ideas,
distinguishing facts from inferences.

5. Evaluating: Making informed judgments on
ideas or materials.

6. Creating: Constructing new meanings or
structures by merging diverse elements.

Notably, Anderson and Krathwohl shifted
‘synthesis’ to the ‘creating’ level (now sixth) and
‘evaluation’ to the second-to-last position in their
updated model.

2. Affective Domain: Human beings have rational and
emotional aspects. Affective learning involves emo-
tions, motivation, cooperation, and attitudes influ-
enced by social factors. It is vital for adapting to society
and involves sub-levels like receiving (listening) and
responding (participating), Affective education takes
time and deals with behavior. Affective also means val-
uing what is being learned and ultimately incorporat-
ing the values of discipline into a way of life, It asks for

better student participation and includes the following

sub-levels:

(a) Receiving: Willingness to listen

(b) Responding: Willingness to participate

(c) Valuing: Willingness to be involved

(d) Organizing: Willingness to be an advocate of an
idea

(e) Characterization: Willingness to change one’s
behaviour or way of life Emotions and ration-
ality can work together, aided by ‘Emotional
Intelligence’ by Daniel Goleman. Both emotional
intelligence and cognitive learning impact affec-
tive learning, highlighting the need to combine
them in education for balanced learning.

1.16

(f) Affective Flattening: It is a kind of pesca
nia. This means that the person doesn’t have he
full range of emotional expression that wanes
do. They are relatively immobile, show unre-
sponsive facial expressions, have poor eye con
tact. Disorders such as catatonia and alogia show
inability to speak. -

3. Psychomotor Domain: This focuses on acquiring
technical skills, with five instructional levels:

(a) Imitation: Learners follow a skilled person’s
demonstration.

(b) Manipulation: Learners experiment with
machinery, equipment, etc.

(c) Precision: Accuracy improves with practice.

(d) Articulation: Achieving efficiency and effective-
ness through practice.

(e) Naturalization: Internalizing skills and adapting
to new situations.

The three learning domains (cognitive, affective, psycho-
motor) are not mutually exclusive, often occurring simul-
taneously with the same content of learning.

Gagne and Briggs Classification of
Teaching and Instructional Objectives

According to this classification, the learning outcomes fall
under the following categories.

1. Intellectual Skills: Essential for navigating the envi-
ronment, encompassing concept learning, rule learn-
ing, and problem-solving.

2. Cognitive Strategies: Comprising techniques for per-
sonal learning, memory, and thinking skills.

3. Verbal Information: Organized knowledge acquired
by an individual.

4. Motor Skills: Involving coordinated actions of the
brain, nervous system, and muscles.

5. Attitudes: Reflecting an individual’s internal state.

The teaching objectives can be put in the following forms

Maxims OF TEACHING

A maxim is a ground rule or a fundamental principle
that has evolved over a period of time. It is a guide for
future action or behaviour. Teaching also has its own
set of maxims, which have been discussed below.

1. Start with Simple, then Progress to Complex: Begin
with basic explanations, using everyday examples,
and gradually introduce more advanced concepts and
technical terms, This approach sparks learners’ inter-
est and aids retention.

2. Connect Known to Unknown: Relate new knowledge
to what learners already know for better retention.

3. Present Seen Before Unseen: Teach about the pres-
ent first to provide a foundation for understanding
the past and future.

4. Transition from Concrete to Abstract: Begin with
familiar concrete objects and introduce abstract con-
cepts later to aid students’ mental development.

5. Move from Specific to General: Begin with specific
examples, followed by the explanation of general
laws and derivations. Experiments and demonstra-
tions can facilitate this process.

6. Start with the Whole, Then Explore the Parts:
Follow the Gestalt psychology principle that humans
perceive the whole before its individual parts. Provide
an introduction or overview of topics, emphasizing
integration during learning.

7. Clarify the Indefinite into Definite: Transform
vague knowledge into clear and definite understand-
ing, addressing students’ doubts.

8. Progress from Psychological to Logical: Emphasize
psychological order during initial learning stages and
shift towards a logical order as learners mature.

9. Shift from Analysis to Synthesis: Initially, students
may have limited or vague knowledge about topics.
Analysis involves breaking problems down into constit-
uent parts for study, while synthesis entails connecting
knowledge gained from analyzing these parts. Teachers
should employ an analytic-synthetic approach.

10. Align with Nature: Adapt a pupil’s education to their
natural inclinations and tendencies.

11. Sensory Training: The five senses—sight, sound,
taste, smell, and touch—are gateways to knowl-
edge. Utilizing as many of these senses as possible

in teaching can be beneficial. Montessori and Frébel
championed this principle.

12. Promote Self-Study: Encourage self-study, a con-
cept akin to Dalton’s system of education. This fosters
independent learning.

PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING

They are closely related to maxims. Teaching methods are
based on two types of principles, general principles and
psychological principles.

General Principles

1. Direction Principle: Development from head to feet,
known as cephalo-caudal, or from the center (spinal
cord) outward to peripheries like the heart and limbs,
termed proximo-distal sequencing,

2. Activity-Based Learning: Frébel’s Kindergarten sys-
tem is grounded in this principle, emphasizing both
physical and mental activities. For instance, students
engage in creating charts and models.

3. Interest-Driven Learning: Fostering genuine inter-
est within the learner’s community can enhance the
effectiveness of the teaching-learning process.

4. Life-Centric Learning: Education linked to real-life
experiences can result in more enduring learning.

5. Clear Objectives: Establishing specific aims helps
optimize teaching resources and maintains a focused
learning approach.

6. Acknowledging Individual Differences: Recognize
that each student possesses unique intelligence, atti-
tudes, abilities, and backgrounds. Teaching methods
should provide equal opportunities for all students.

7. Thoughtful Selection: Given the ever-expanding
scope of knowledge, educators must select relevant,
up-to-date content aligned with learners’ objectives.

8. Systematic Planning: To achieve time-bound objec-
tives, teaching should be organized systematically to
maximize resource utilization,

9, Conceptual Division: Dividing subject matter into
manageable units with clear links between them facil-
itates easier comprehension and learning.

10. Revision Principle: To ensure lasting learning,
acquired knowledge should be revisited immediately
and repeatedly,

11. Creation and Recreation Principle: Fostering a humor-
ous and creative classroom environment is essential.

12. Democratic Engagement Principle: Involving stu-
dents in planning and executing activities fosters self-
confidence and self-respect among learners.

Psychological Principles

1. Motivation and Interest Principle: Recognizing
each student’s unique psychological makeup allows
teachers to identify and address their motives and
needs, thereby fostering motivation.

2. Recreation Principle: Breaks are necessary to com-
bat fatigue from lengthy classes, alleviating monot-
ony and preparing students for renewed learning.



=== Page 10 ===
1.18

Repetition and Exercise Principle: Particularly cru-
cial for young children’s learning.

Creativity and Self-expression Principle: Relevant,
especially in subjects like mathematics and languages.
Sympathy and Cooperation Principle: Building
motivation in students through empathy and coop-
erative environments.

Reinforcement Principle: Appropriate rewards for
desired behavior can encourage students effectively.

. Remedial Teaching Principle: Essential for teachers

to identify errors and provide improved solutions to
problems.

1.

The feedback is an important element in classroom

teaching. Which of the following elements does not

apply in the context of feedback?

(a) It should be available in a time bound manner.

(b) Feedback should not be educative in nature.

(c) Feedback should reference a skill or specific
knowledge.

(d) Be sensitive to the individual needs of the student.

. How does the principle of connecting known to
unknown enhance learning?
(a) By making new information abstract and difficult
to grasp.
(b) By relating new knowledge to what learners
already know for better retention.

(c) By focusing only on completely new concepts
without any prior reference.

(d) By ignoring what students already know and
introducing entirely new topics.

. What does the principle of transitioning from con-

crete to abstract involve in teaching?

(a) Starting with abstract theories before introducing
practical examples.

(b) Using only concrete objects and avoiding abstract
concepts.

(c) Beginning with familiar concrete objects and
gradually introducing abstract concepts.

(d) Completely separating concrete experiences from
abstract thinking.

@ Effective Teaching Behaviour

The following aspects make teaching more effective.

1.

Enhancing Teacher Training Through Microteaching

Microteaching is a dynamic method of teacher preparation that has
advantages for both aspiring and experienced educators. They gain a
deeper grasp of how teaching and learning work through this method,
which also helps them become better teachers. In a condensed train-
ing approach, student teachers prepare and conduct succinct sessions
for small groups of students (often 3 to 10) in between 5 and 20 min-
utes. After the lesson, reflection takes the stage, allowing teachers
to assess their own teaching and witness peer teaching, occasionally

through video recordings.

The micro-lesson is thoroughly reviewed with analysis and
evaluation involved. When given constructive criticism, trainees
are guided to revise and re-teach the lesson, which helps them
grow their pedagogical expertise and increases their confidence as
teachers. These results can be achieved by microteaching with few

resources needed.

Additionally, this strategy gives students real-world teaching
experiences that bridge theory and practise. Microteaching cycle is shown in the diagram.

Prioritize Understanding Over Exposure: Shift
from surface teaching to fostering deep understand-
ing by focusing on a select few critical concepts.
Clear, Explicit and Repetitive Instruction: Clearly
communicate key ideas, their purpose, and establish
connections with prior learning through repetition.

. Gradual Support Removal (Scaffold Instruction):

Begin with strong support, then gradually decrease it
as students exhibit independent competence.

i Methods of Teaching

The term teaching method refers to the general principles,
pedagogy and management strategies used for classroom
instruction. They become important after setting objectives.

As per NTA-NET syllabus, we have the following two
extreme set of methods for institutes of higher learning:

TEACHER-CENTRED TEACHING MetHops
Lecture Method: Chalk And Talk

The lecture method is the most common and traditional
way of teaching. In this approach, teachers explain facts,
principles, or concepts to the class. Typically, the teacher
plays an active role, while students are passive listeners.
However, it can become more interactive if students ask
questions for clarification.

1. Teacher-centred methods
2, Learner-centred methods
These can be assumed to be two extreme approaches. In

between, we can have a third method approach, which is
called mixed approach.

TV or Video Presentation: Bringing the World to
the Classroom

Television or video presentations represent an evolution
from radio or audio presentations, offering the potential
to virtually transport the entire world into the classroom.
Following the screening of a video presentation, discus-
sions or tasks ensue.

Advantages

1. Access to Experts: Video presentations bring
renowned personalities and experts directly into the
classroom, enriching the learning experience.

2. Adult Learners: Particularly beneficial for adult
learners, video presentations cater to diverse educa-
tional needs.

3. Supplemental Resources: Illustrated lectures and
demonstrations can be complemented by teaching
aids like slides, models, specimens, and more.

4. Accessibility: Learners in remote areas can easily access
educational content through video presentations.

5. Subject Relevance: Subjects such as geography,
astronomy, and others benefit significantly from
visual and dynamic presentations.

Limitations

1. Limited Interaction: Two-way communication is
restricted, reducing opportunities for active student
engagement.

2. Scheduling Challenges: Coordinating complex sched-
ules for telecast periods can pose logistical challenges.

Concept Box

Dialogic Teaching versus Direct Teaching

Dialogic Teaching, developed by Robin Alexander
in the early 2000s, leverages the ‘power of talk’ or
conversation to stimulate students’ thinking and
enhance their learning. It allows teachers to pre-
cisely assess student needs, frame learning tasks,
and monitor progress.

Direct Teaching employs clear and explicit
instructional techniques, often for teaching spe-
cific skills. In this teacher-directed approach,
instructors present information to the class, com-
monly used in language instruction when the use
of the native language is unnecessary. It empha-
sizes explanations, reviews, and feedback.

Mastery Learning Model (MLM), introduced by
educator Benjamin Bloom in 1968, is an educa-
tional strategy that employs tiered lessons, multi-
ple assessments, and instructor feedback to help
students master learning material. This approach
asserts that given time and appropriate tools, stu-
dents can achieve mastery in their learning. MLM
is also known as Competency-based Learning or
Learning for Mastery (LFM).

Mixep Group TEACHING METHODS

This may be primarily meant for 3 to 12 students. Some
of these methods are group discussion, seminar, project
work, tutorials, role playing, etc. These are briefly
discussed below.

Group Discussion (GD)

Group Discussion, often categorized under small group
teaching methods, has a rich historical background dating
back to Greek scholars and those at Nalanda University.
This method revolves around scrutinizing various fac-
ets of a topic, exploring relationships among facts, and
deriving conclusions. It encourages students to engage in
critical thinking, analyze and synthesize information, and
refine their presentation skills. Group Discussion finds rel-
evance in several contexts:

1. Supplementing Lectures: It complements traditional
lectures by offering a deeper exploration of subjects.

2. Observation Visits and Case Presentations: Valuable
for sharing insights and information gathered during
field visits.

3. Promoting Critical Thinking: Stimulates thinking by
pooling knowledge, ideas, and feelings.

4. Rationalizing Facts: Helps students view informa-
tion in a logical manner, fostering intelligent learning.

5. Fostering Team Spirit: Encourages collaborative
learning, shared responsibilities, and the develop-
ment of team dynamics.

6. Talent Discovery: Can reveal hidden talents and
abilities.

Forms of Discussion
1. Classroom Discussion: An informal approach suit-
able for smaller class sizes, where the entire class par-
ticipates, with key points often listed on the board.

. Formal Group Discussion: Involves smaller groups
of 3-5 students who later combine into a larger group
to revisit and discuss key points.

3. Symposium: A structured presentation involving
experts presenting papers or speeches, followed by
discussion. It is systematic and well-planned.

4. Seminar: Similar to a symposium but often used in
educational settings, promoting self-learning, inde-
pendent thinking, and cooperation.

5. Panel Discussion: A method where a small group dis-

cusses an assigned topic or issue creatively in front of
a larger audience.

. Conference: Similar to class discussion but with lim-
ited students. Often used before and after observa-
tion visits. It may involve multiple teachers and be
planned, partly planned, or unplanned.

3. Fosters practical group leadership and analytical skills
development.

Limitations
1. May require significant time and effort from both
teachers and students.
2. Can create emotional stress and unpleasant feelings.
3. Risk of a few students dominating the discussion.
4. Discussions may deviate from the intended topic,
making it unsuitable for all subjects.

Figure 1.10 Panel Discussion

Brainstorming

Brainstorming is a collaborative and creative group tech-
nique used to generate a multitude of ideas swiftly regard-
ing a specific topic or problem, with the intention of later
assessing these ideas. During brainstorming, participants
are free to exchange thoughts with one another, and criti-
cism is discouraged during the idea-generation phase.
Here, quantity often takes precedence over quality, and
spontaneity is key.

Multiple rounds of brainstorming may be conducted
until all possible ideas are exhausted. Subsequently, par-
ticipants evaluate all generated ideas, ultimately identify-
ing the best ones.

Advantages

1. Fosters Creativity: Encourages participants to think
creatively, fostering the production and exploration
of ideas.

2. Enhanced Participation: Provides ample opportu-
nity for a large number of participants to contribute.

3. Cost-Effective: Requires minimal preparation, mak-
ing it an economical choice.

Limitations

1. Lack of Systematic Approach: Not a highly struc-
tured method for studying a subject.

2. Potential Reluctance: Some participants may be hes-
itant to actively engage in the brainstorming process.

Project Method

This method lets students learn by doing projects, either
alone or in small groups. It encourages them to learn
through hands-on experiences and follow what they’re
interested in. Instead of just reading textbooks, students
get to really experience what they’re learning about. This
way of learning focuses on teamwork and solving prob-
lems together..

Advantages

1. Critical Thinking: Students cultivate critical think
ing skills as they engage in hands-on projects, encour-
aging deeper understanding and problem-solving.

2. Teamwork: The method promotes teamwork and
collaborative skills as students work together on
projects.

Limitations

1. Continuous Monitoring: Project-based learning
may require continuous monitoring by educators
to ensure students stay on track and meet learning
objectives.

2. Resource Demands: Implementing projects may
demand additional resources, including materials,
technology, and time.

Role Playing: Dramatic Ways To Learn

Role playing serves as a powerful educational tool, aiding
in the resolution of classroom interpersonal issues and
the teaching of vital human-relations skills. It finds appli-
cation in various contexts, including the dramatization of
literary and historical works, as well as the re-enactment
of historical or contemporary events. Regardless of its
use, role playing offers students a dynamic and illuminat-
ing experience.

Advantages

1. Real-Life Resemblance: Role playing simulates
authentic scenarios.

2. Interactive Engagement: It fosters active participa-
tion from all group members.

3. Immediate Feedback: Role playing provides prompt
responses.

4. Skill Development: It cultivates social, decision-
making, problem-solving, negotiating, and manipula-
tion skills.

5. Attitude Transformation: It effectively influences
participants’ attitudes.

Limitations

1. Unpredictable Outcomes: Role playing results can
be unpredictable.

2. Complexity Gap: Real-life situations tend to be more
intricate.

3. Resource-Intensive: It demands a_ substantial
amount of resources.

Jeaching Aptitude

Simulated Training

This method uses realistic environments to train people
for specific jobs or tasks. For example, pilots and astro-
nauts practice in settings that closely match real flight
conditions. This type of training helps prepare them for
the actual challenges they will face in their jobs.

Advantages
1. They are economical in the long run.
2. Safety aspects are taken care of.

Limitation
1. It entails high initial investment in machinery, equip-
ment, etc.

Tutorial Teaching: Through Individual Attention

This method teaches small groups, aiming to improve
problem-solving skills. It provides personal help and
focuses on each student’s needs. It’s good for differ-
ent ways of learning, as it adapts to each student. This
method helps students understand ideas better, master
the subject, and offers extra help if needed.

Demonstration Method

This method is about learning by doing and moving from
hands-on activities to more abstract ideas. It’s about
showing how things are done, not just talking about
them.The students learn in different ways in classrooms
which includes understanding ideas, developing feelings
or attitudes, and improving physical skills.

Figure 1.11 Demonstration Method

Demonstration can be described as a blend of verbal
explanation and a live presentation, often utilizing equip-
ment or visual aids to convey essential information, ideas,
or processes.

Advantages

1. Effective for Explanation: Proficient in elucidating
materials, objects, and concepts.

2. Clarity on Abstract Concepts: Particularly effective
in clarifying abstract concepts.

3. Comprehensive Learning: Facilitates the achieve-
ment of cognitive, psychomotor, and affective objec-
tives by actively engaging students both mentally and
physically.

Limitation

Limited Participation: Offers opportunities for only a
select few to actively participate in the practical demon-
stration process.

LEARNER-CENTRED TEACHING METHODS

These methods focus on the unique differences among
students. Key methods include giving assignments, using
case studies, computer-based learning, open learning,
personalized instruction, and programmed lessons.

Assignments

Assignments serve multiple purposes in education,
encouraging students to acquire additional knowledge,
conduct surveys, apply what they’ve learned, and solve
numerical problems. While learners play the primary
role, teachers also contribute significantly by planning
assignments and guiding students on relevant informa-
tion sources.

Assignments can cover a wide range of topics, but their
design should prevent mere copying from textbooks. They
should be open-ended, fostering creativity in students.

Advantages

1. Encourages independent work.

2. Enhances comprehension, analytical, and problem-
solving skills.

3. Promotes creativity.

Limitation
Risk of students copying each other’s work if assignments
aren’t well-structured.

Case Study

This method puts students in real situations, helping them
apply what they learn in class to actual problems. It uses
real examples of challenges or decisions in everyday life.
Students become decision-makers, using what they know
to solve these problems. This method works well in many
subjects, like psychology, business, biology, and law. Case
studies can be short for a class or long for a project, mak-
ing learning active and practical.

Programmed Instruction (PI)

PI is a structured learning method where students go
through self-paced, logically ordered learning steps. After
each step, they receive immediate feedback. This helps
them understand and correct their learning at each stage.

Problems Needs Objectives

To develop ideas efficiently, it’s important to have
a clear plan:

1. Identify the Problem or Situation:
Understand the issue you want to solve or the
situation you're dealing with.

2. Set an Objective: Decide what you want to
achieve in relation to the problem or situation.

3. Create a Strategy: Plan how to reach your
objective, considering the problem or situation
you've identified.

Advantages

1. There is regular feedback.
2. This ensures active participation of the learner and it
can be used for any subject.

Limitation
1. Learner motivation may get diminished after sometime.

Personalized System of Instruction (PSI)

PSI reflects the Keller Plan which is a self paced study.
This is defined by five core features:

1. Mastery Learning Model (MLM): Students learn
at their own pace, progressing through the material
based on their ‘individual speed’.

2. Self-pacing: Before advancing, students must master
each unit, usually requiring a 90% accuracy rate on
tests to demonstrate understanding.

3. Emphasis on Written Material: There should be
focus on independent learning through textbooks and
study guides, focusing on self-directed study.

4. Proctors: Proctors provide personalized support,
offering individual guidance, feedback, and assis-
tance in the learning process.

5. Lectures for Motivation: Instead of being the pri-
mary source of information, lectures and presenta-
tions serve to keep students engaged and motivated
in their learning journey.

Advantages

1. Mastery-Based: Rooted in mastery learning
principles.

2. Self-Paced: Facilitates personalized, self-paced learn-
ing experiences.

Limitations
1. Not Suitable for Rapidly Changing Content: This
method doesn’t work well for subjects where the
information often changes.
2. Inadequate for Psychomotor and Affective Learning:
It’s not effective for teaching physical skills or changing
emotions and attitudes.

Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL)

CAL revolves around utilizing computers to facilitate
the information flow in the learning process. Computers
possess the remarkable capacity to process information
rapidly, with precision, and to adjust dynamically to the
learner’s requirements, challenges, and advancements
--capabilities far surpassing those of books or video tapes.

Advantages

1. Enhanced Flexibility and Control: Offers greater
flexibility and superior control compared to alterna-
tive methods.

2. Effective for Various Purposes: Effectively supports
activities such as drilling and practice, as well as sim-
ulation and modeling.

Limitation

1. Impersonal and Costly: May lack a personal touch
and can involve substantial costs.

Open Learning

This is a flexible teaching method that allows learners
free access to diverse resources like people, materials, and
facilities. It usually removes the requirement for regular
class attendance and has few admission barriers. This
approach supports self-guided study but also promotes
in-person interactions between instructors and students,
often through tutorials. It frequently employs multime-
dia learning materials. However, open learning might not
be best for fast-changing subjects due to its demands on
time, expertise, and resources.

Advantage
Flexibility: Provides learners with flexible study options.

Limitations

1. Inadequate for Psychomotor and Affective
Objectives: Not suitable for achieving psychomotor
and affective learning objectives.

2. Resource-Intensive: Demands significant time,
expertise, and resources and may not be suitable for
rapidly changing subjects.

Interactive Video

Interactive video is an instructional approach that can
effectively address cognitive, psychomotor, and affec-
tive learning objectives. It offers learners the flexibility to
access specific information randomly and receive instant
feedback on the outcomes of their actions.

The core of interactive video lies in video simulations,
featuring a multitude of video segments depicting real-
life scenarios.

Advantage

Enhancéd Decision-making: Empowers individuals with
improved decision-making capabilities.

Limitation
Resource-Intensive: Time-consuming and demands sig-
nificant resources and expertise.

Reflective Teaching: To Enhance Classroom Practices

Classroom teaching is influenced by various factors,
including individual differences among students, the
classroom environment, the teacher’s and learners’ abili-
ties, and the subject matter being taught. There is no one-
size-fits-all teaching method, but educators should strive
to find an approach that suits their specific teaching con-
text. Reflective teaching, in particular, proves valuable for
pre-service teachers.

Advantages of Reflective Teaching

1. Utilization of Experience-Based Learning (EBL):
This approach employs EBL techniques, engaging the
learner holistically and promoting reflection on expe-
riences while fostering openness to new ones.

2. Structured Steps: Reflective teaching involves a
structured process, encompassing steps like suggest-
ing, identifying problems, formulating hypotheses,
reasoning, and testing.

Questioning Professional Practice: It encourages
educators to question and critically examine their
teaching practices and methodologies.

5

Methods for Reflective Teaching
Reflection in teaching can take various forms:

1. Peer Observation: Teachers observe and learn from

their peers.

Written Accounts: Educators maintain written

records of their teaching experiences.

3. Self-Reports: Teachers generate self-assessments
and reflections on their teaching.

4. Auto-Biographies: Educators explore their teaching
journey through autobiographical accounts.

5. Journal Writing: Keeping journals aids in continuous
reflection.

6. Collaborative Diary Keeping: Collaborative efforts
involve multiple educators in reflective practice.

7. Recording Lessons: Educators record their teaching
sessions for later review.

8. Student Feedback: Feedback from students provides

valuable insights.

Teacher’s Stories: Sharing personal narratives con-

tributes to the reflective process.

Heuristic Approach: Self-Guided Exploration

The heuristic method, championed by Prof. Armstrong,
champions independent problem-solving. Here, stu-

dents embark on a journey to unearth answers to their
queries without external aid. This method transforms
learners into knowledge discoverers, nurturing their
innate curiosity. Rather than inundating students with
facts, its central goal is to equip them with the skill of
acquiring knowledge across disciplines like science,
mathematics, and grammar.

Advantage: Cultivates self-learning

Limitation: Limited Emphasis on Factual Knowledge

Differentiated Instruction (DI)

Differentiated instruction is a flexible and effective teach-
ing approach. It involves teachers using various methods
to support learning, including whole-group, small-group,
and one-on-one instruction. This approach prioritizes
the quality of teaching over the quantity of content. It
embraces diverse teaching approaches to cater to differ-
ent learning styles and strengths. It places students at the
center, ensuring lessons are engaging, meaningful, and
interactive. Overall, it is a well-structured and intentional
teaching method.

The Flexibility Dimension in Teaching Methods
Teaching flexibility encompasses various styles, including:

Autocratic Style: In this approach, the teacher maintains
control over teaching methodologies. It encompasses
methods like lectures, lesson demonstrations, tutorials,
and programmed instruction.

Permissive Style: These methods prioritize student-
centered learning, allowing students to choose what
and how they learn while receiving guidance from the
teacher. Permissive styles include question-answer ses-
sions, heuristic learning, projects, reviews, group discus-
sions, role-playing, assignments, discovery-based learn-
ing, Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAD, brainstorming,
open-independent study, leadership groups, and sensitiv-
ity training.

T-Group Method: In T-group sessions, participants
explore self-awareness through interactions within small
groups of 8 to 14 people. This experience-based learning
occurs over an extended period, involving feedback, prob-
lem-solving, and role-playing techniques.

Sensitivity Training: Linked with T-groups, sensitivity
training aims to increase individuals’ awareness of their
own goals, prejudices, and group dynamics. This process
involves the following steps:

1. Unfreezing Old Values: Recognizing the inadequacy
of existing values and resolving conflicts between old
and new values.

2. Developing New Values: Acquiring new values
through training and similar methods.

3. Refreezing New Values: Solidifying new values by
practising new roles and behaviors.

al Gagne’s Teaching-Learning Process

Robert Gagne (1916-2002), an educational psychologist,
pioneered instructional science in the 1940s. His book
‘The Conditions of Learning’ (1965) outlined a nine-step
process for effective teaching:

1. Gaining Attention (Reception): Capture students’
focus and signal the start of the learning process
through various means, such as raising the volume of
your voice, using gestures, and showing a short video.

2. Informing Learners of the Objective (Expectancy):
Clearly communicate the lecture’s objectives and ben-
efits to the learners.

3. Stimulating Recall of Prior Learning (Retrieval):
Establishes connections with previous learning to
build on existing knowledge.

4. Presenting the Stimulus (Selective Perception):
Effectively introduce new information using diverse
media and styles to accommodate different learning
preferences.

5. Providing Learning Guidance (Semantic Encoding):
Offer alternative approaches, such as examples, case
studies, graphics, and analogies, to facilitate compre-
hension and retention.

6. Eliciting Performance (Responding): Ensure stu-
dents have grasped the content by encouraging them
to demonstrate their knowledge, potentially through
role-playing exercises.

7. Providing Feedback (Reinforcement): After assess-
ments, offer feedback to reinforce key points and clar-
ify any misunderstandings.

8. Assessing Performance (Retrieval): Assess stu-
dents’ understanding through independent tests,
questionnaires, or essays.

9. Enhancing Retention and Transfer (Generalization):
Promote long-term retention and application of
knowledge by encouraging learners to apply their
skills in different contexts through repeated practice.

Gagne’s framework provides a structured approach to
instructional design and effective teaching.

LEARNING PRINCIPLES OF ROBERT GAGNE

The eight basic types of learning can be organized in a
hierarchy, with the first four considered ‘behavioral’ and
the rest ‘cognitive.’

1. Signal Learning: The simplest form of learning
involving conditioned responses to specific signals.
For example, stopping at a red traffic light. In similar
Pavlov’s famous dog experiment, he conditioned dogs

to associate the sound of a bell with food. Initially, the
bell had no significance, but after repeated pairings
with food, the dogs began to salivate at the sound of
the bell alone.

2. Stimulus-Response Learning: Also known as ‘oper-
and conditioning,’ where responses are triggered by
specific stimuli. For instance, students raising their
hands when a teacher instructs them to.

3. Chaining: Connecting previously learned stimulus-
response bonds into linked sequences. This includes
motor chaining (e.g., riding a bike) and verbal chain-
ing (e.g., reciting a time table).

4, Verbal Association: Establishing links between items
with a verbal nature, aiding language development. For
example, associating the names ‘Ishwar’ and ‘Chander’

5. Discrimination Learning: Developing the ability to
differentiate between similar stimuli that differ sys-
tematically, such as distinguishing objects by color or
shape.

6. Concept Learning: Learning to respond consis-
tently to stimuli that share common characteristics,
enabling generalization and categorization based on
abstract features.

7. Rule Learning: A high-level cognitive process involv-
ing learning relationships between concepts, which
can be applied in various situations not previously
encountered.

8. Problem-Solving: The highest level of cognitive pro-
cessing, where individuals invent complex rules or
algorithms to solve specific probletns and apply these
methods to similar problems.

Additionally, the 5E Model, proposed by Atkin and
Karplus, emphasizes a structured approach to under-
standing concepts over time through the phases of
Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate

The Treasure Within: Jacques Delors from France is the
main proponent of the four pillar approach. He stated
that lifelong learning is essential for gaining self-esteem
and the ability to take control of one’s own life.

Learning and Learner’s
Characteristics

DeFINING LEARNING

Defining ‘learning’ may seem straightforward, given our
lifelong experience with acquiring new knowledge and
skills. However, at its core, learning is a psychological con-
cept, and psychologists have offered several definitions:

1. Gates: Learning is the process of modifying behavior
through experience.

2. Skinner: Learning is a progressive adaptation of
behavior.

3. Crow and Crow: Learning encompasses the acquisi-
tion of habits, knowledge, and attitudes.

Learning can also be described as a lasting change in one’s
ability to perform. To understand learning more com.
prehensively, various schools of thought have emerged,
including behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism,
each addressing different aspects of the learning process.
These theories are explored at the beginning of this unit.

1.28

PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING SIMPLIFIED

In addition to the theories and teaching maxims we’ve dis-
cussed, here are some key principles for effective learning:

1. Association: Teachers should continuously connect
new learning with previous knowledge.

2. Clarity: Learning goals and objectives must be clear
and periodically assessed.

3. Self-Activity: Engaging the senses enhances learning.

4. Rewards: Learning should be challenging yet
satisfying.

5. Practice: Learning should lead to a practical under-
standing of facts.

6. Nurturing Environment: A supportive physical and
social environment aids learning.

7. Variable Learning Ability: Recognize and accom-
modate individual differences in learning styles and
speeds.

8. Multiple Exposure: Employ diverse teaching meth-
ods and aids to reinforce learning.

9, Learning Capacity: Acknowledge that learning rates
may decline with age and address related factors.

10. Active Process: Learning is a personal choice, and
practices like using audio-visual aids can help.

11. Theory and Practice: Balance theory and practical
application for effective learning.

12. Effective Communication: Incorporate suitable
audio-visual aids to enhance the teaching-learning
process.

Diverse Forms oF LEARNING

Learning encompasses various modes and methods,
often facilitated by our sensory organs. Apart from for-
mal teaching, several distinct ways through which indi-
viduals, especially children, acquire knowledge are elu-
cidated below:

1. Imitation: Imitation is a common and fundamental
form of learning. Children often emulate their parents
or role models. Even adults engage in imitation, par-
ticularly those who seek to bolster their confidence
or assertiveness. With practice, individuals can adopt
the characteristics they admire.

2. Observation: Observing others is an intriguing
method of learning. To gain insights into the social
behaviors of leaders, superiors, or teachers, individu-
als often need to closely observe their interactions
and habits in their respective environments.

3. Experience: Learning is intrinsically tied to experi-
ences. Experiential learning occurs when individu-
als draw knowledge from their own experiences. It
involves questioning and reflection to facilitate con-
tinuous learning.

4. Teaching: Traditional teaching methods involve
teachers selecting a subject, subjecting it to content
and task analysis, and delivering lectures to students.
Students acquire knowledge by listening to these
lectures.

____ aa

5. Instruction: Instruction leans towards physical dem-
onstrations and practical skills rather than cognitive
development. It typically involves demonstrations
accompanied by explanations, enabling learners to
acquire both knowledge and skills.

6. Trial and Error: In a world with expanding knowl-
edge and complexity, solving problems can be risky,
and suitable answers may not always be readily avail-
able. Therefore, trial and error plays a significant
role in learning, especially in fields like mathematics,
where drill and practice are effective.

7. Reflection: Reflective individuals tend to analyze
entire situations and explore alternative problem-
solving approaches. They employ cognitive abili-
ties such as reasoning and analysis to make sense of
complex scenarios, while impulsive individuals often
respond spontaneously.

8. Experimentation: Experimentation is an essential
method that allows individuals to engage with reality.
It is closely associated with deductive reasoning and
quantitative techniques. Successful learning often
hinges on selecting the most suitable method, consid-
ering the subject matter and learning objectives.

9. Probing: Asking questions is an art knownas probing.
Convergent questions have a single answer, while
divergent questions can have countless responses.
Questions can serve various purposes, such as fac-
tual inquiries, explanatory queries, analytical explo-
ration, hypothetical scenarios, and decision-making
deliberations.

Self-learning, or conative learning, empowers indt-
viduals to take charge of their education

Furthermore, maintaining anecdotal notes can be valu-
able for recording students’ day-to-day development,
specific behaviors, speech patterns, language and social/
emotional growth, peer interactions, and any concerns
that may arise.

Motivated Class Features

A good classroom should have qualities that help students
feel good and stay interested. These include:

1. Belongingness: To make a friendly environment
where students can make close friends and feel part
of a group.

2. Meaningfulness: To make subjects like math inter-
esting and relevant to students.

3. Competence: To create a place where students are
motivated to do well, try hard tasks, and get helpful
feedback.

4. Accountability: To have rules that make stu-
dents responsible for what they do, teaching them
discipline.

5. Autonomy: To let students make their own choices
based on what they like and believe, helping them
learn on their own.

Teaching Aptitude

Learning Characteristics

1. Learning is Unitary: Learning involves a holistic
response, encompassing intellectual, emotional,
physical, and spiritual aspects, contributing to the
achievement of educational goals.

9. Learning is a Complex Whole: Learning comprises
various dimensions, including knowledge, skills,
insights, values, attitudes, and habits. Key dimensions
include:

(a) Knowledge Development: Organized and struc-
tured knowledge within each discipline, foster-
ing critical thinking abilities like analysis and
synthesis.

Skills Development: Proficiency and competence

achieved through practice and reflection, progressing

from the following stages:

(a) Cognitive stage - Achieved through declarative
knowledge

(b) Associative stage - Combining small steps into
larger ones

(c) Automated stage - Here, the whole procedure can
be accomplished without much attention. The
brain process shifts from reflective to reflexive.

Attitudes Development: Mental states influencing
responses to events, involving cognitive, affective,
and conative dimensions.

Cognitive dimension: Beliefs and rationalizations

which explains the holding of the attitudes

(b) Affective dimension: Emotional aspects of atti-
tude, such as likes, dislikes, feeling of distaste

(c) Conative or behavioural dimension: This
involves the extent to which an individual is pre-
pared to act on the attitude that they hold.

3. Learning may be Planned or Unplanned: Learning
can be intentional or spontaneous.

4. Learning may be Active or Passive: Learning may
involve active engagement or passive reception.

5. Learning may be Individual and Collective:
Typically individual but can also occur collectively
within groups.

6. Process and Outcome: Learning is both a process
and an outcome, extending throughout life.

7. Learning is incremental: Often accumulates incre-
mentally, building upon prior knowledge or leading
to transformation.

8. Learning is Stimulated by Experience: Triggered by
various experiences, including success, failure, and
more,

9. Learning May be With Desirable and Undesirable
Outcomes: Outcomes can be positive or negative.

10. Moral Dimension: Learning always carries a moral
dimension.

11. Self-Active, Creative, and Transferable: Learning
is inherently self-driven, creative, and transferable
across contexts.

In essence, learning is multifaceted and ever-evolving.

1.29

ConpbiITIONS oF LEARNING

External conditions play a pivotal role in various learning
processes. Here’s a concise overview of these fundamen-
tal conditions:

1. Contiguity: Learning thrives when stimuli and
responses occur almost simultaneously. This principle
applies to teaching as well.

2. Practice: Repetition of responses, such as in Stimulus-

Response (S-R) learning, classical conditioning, oper-

ant conditioning, and skill acquisition.

Reinforcement: Utilized in diverse ways to yield vari-

ous effects.

4. Feedback: Provides knowledge of response accuracy
or the need for corrections, reinforcing the learning
process and enhancing efficiency.

5. Generalization and Discrimination: Both phenom-
ena, like distinguishing colors, are observed during
the learning process, rather than being considered
standalone learning conditions.

Learner’s Response to Learning
Singh and Sharma (1987) have suggested five component

behaviours of skill for managing students’ responses in
the classroom to enhance participation:

1. Prompting for Engagement
- Providing clues, hints, or partial answers to guide
students.
- Clues given for correct responses are called prompts.

2. Redirection for Participation
- Redirecting a question to multiple students when
one struggles to answer.
- Encourages greater involvement, extra thinking
time, and stimulates brainstorming.

3. Seeking Further Information (Clarifying
Understanding)
- Seeking additional information related to a question
or answer.
- Ensures students have a solid grasp of the concept.

4. Refocusing (Enhancing Application)

- When a student answers correctly, encouraging
them to apply their knowledge in different or new
scenarios.

- Promotes better practical use of acquired knowledge.
Increasing Critical Awareness

In case a student gives the correct answer, the teacher

puts higher order questions in order to increase criti-
cal thinking or awareness among students.

ce

B Learning Environment

Learning is a continuous process shaped by interactions
between individuals and their surroundings. The learning
environment encompasses natural conditions, circum-
stances, sociocultural contexts, and influences that enrich
experiences and foster learning. Various theories help us
understand the learning environment.



=== Page 16 ===
Albert Bandura’s Social Learning Theory: This sug-
gests that people can learn new behaviors by observing
and imitating others. It involves interactions between per-
sonal traits, behavior, and the environment. Both social
and physical environments impact learning.

Lev Vygotsky: He was basically a constructivist who
emphasized that mastering culturally significant tasks,
like language, occurs through social interactions.

Different learning environments result in diverse
learning outcomes. Earlier we have discussed the types of
education into formal and informal type. Here also, we
can discuss the types of learning into formal and informal.

In India, adult education programmes, basic education
programmes, literacy programmes, health awareness
programme, etc. are certain examples.

Curricular experiences are generally formulated keep-
ing in mind the specific needs of the target group. These
are more individualised rather than broad-based and gen-
eral in nature. The transaction of learning experiences is
centred around community resources.

IMPORTANCE OF CREATING A PositTiIVE LEARNING

ENVIRONMENT

Some constituents of an institution’s environment are dis-
cussed as follows:

1. Physical Environment: The physical surroundings
of an educational institution, like classrooms, sig-
nificantly impact learning. Factors such as air quality,
temperature, and noise can affect students’ learning
experiences, Classroom set-up and furniture play a
role, and flexible spaces are beneficial. Ownership
and engagement with the environment are essential.

2. Psychological Environment: The school’s philoso-
phy and practices create a psychological atmosphere
for learners. This environment influences students’
emotions and attitudes. For instance, a threatening
situation can lead to anxiety and undesirable behav-
iors. A positive psychological environment is crucial
for effective learning.

3. Social Environment: Interactions with peers shape
students’ social development. Cooperation, self-sacri-
fice, and loyalty are learned through peer interactions.
Outdoor activities promote qualities like courage and
resourcefulness. Positive personal relationships foster
trust, belongingness, and self-respect, enhancing the
learning environment.

4. Motivational Climate: Establishing a motivating atmo-
sphere is vital from the start. Students should perceive
the value of their work and that of others. Teachers can
demonstrate task value by linking it to real-life applica-
tions. Encouraging effort through rewards and praise
also contributes to a motivating climate.

5. Understanding Individual Differences: Recognizing
the diversity among students and customizing teach-
ing approaches accordingly is essential. Teachers
should accommodate individual needs to the extent
possible to create an inclusive learning environment.

Main Steps in Learning Process

1. Reception: Grab learners’ attention with sudden
stimulus changes.

2. Expectancy: Clearly state learning objectives and
outcomes.

3. Retrieval to working memory: Trigger recall of prior
knowledge.

4. Selective perception: Present content with clear
features.

5. Semantic encoding: Guide the learning process.

6. Responding: Engage learners in active participation.

7. Reinforcement: Offer feedback to learners.

8. Retrieval and reinforcement: Encourage more
learner performance with feedback.

9. Generalization: Enhance retention through practice
with diverse problems.
Zimmerman’s self-regulation model: This model
consists of three phases that explain how learners
manage their own learning:

* Forethought Phase: During this initial phase,
learners set their learning goals, evaluate their
motivation and skills, and create strategies for
achieving their objectives.

¢ Performance Phase: In the performance phase,
learners put their plans into action. They execute
their strategies, monitor their progress, and adapt
their plans if necessary to stay on track.

¢ Self-Reflection Phase: In the final phase, learn-
ers engage in self-reflection. They assess their
performance, identify areas for improvement, and
establish new goals based on their reflections. This
phase encourages continuous learning and growth.

Individual Differences in Learning-—
Types of Learners

Learners vary in age, culture, experiences, physical and
mental attributes, goals, and learning styles. Teachers
must recognize these differences and offer diverse meth-
ods and resources to cater to individual needs and styles
when selecting educational tools. Identifying critical
characteristics is crucial for designing effective instruc-
tional plans.

Types oF LEARNERS

There are three main categories of learner characteristics,
such as general characteristics, specific entry competencies
and learning styles.

LEARNER CHARACTERISTICS

1. On the Basis of Personal and Social Attributes
~ Help in planning instructional objectives based on
relevant physical and social characteristics. .
— Social factors include age, maturity, motiva-
tion, attitude, expectations, talents, dexterity, and
adaptability.

Teaching Aptitude

-

~ Differences in learner characteristics between ado-
lescents and adults are important.

. Field Independent vs. Field Dependent Learners:

— Field-independent learners rely less on others, pre-
fer analytical thinking, and work in self-structured
situations.

— Suitable for solo activities like extensive reading and
writing.

— Field-dependent learners excel in interpersonal
relationships, perceive globally, prefer existing struc-
tures, and need externally defined goals.

— Benefit from activities connecting different lesson
parts, group discussions, content predictions, and
audiovisual aids.

Reflectivity and Impulsivity: The conceptual tempo

can be given as follows:

— It refers to the speed of students’ responses and the

number of errors they make.

e Fast conceptual tempo: Quick responses with
some mistakes (impulsive style of learning).

¢ Slow conceptual tempo: Slow responses with
fewer mistakes (reflective style of learning).

— Impulsive learners collect less data, are less system-

atic, and avoid exploring alternative solutions.

— Reflective learners take more time to gather and

analyze information before responding.

Classroom based Learning Styles: Learning styles

are traits that refer to how learners receive and pro-

cess information.

(a) Visual Learners:
— Visual learners grasp information best through
sight.
~ Aspects like brightness, size, color, distance,
clarity, frame, and symmetry are crucial to visual
learners.
— They need to see things to learn effectively.
— Visual learners can be categorized as verbalists
(focus on words and letters) or imagists (focus on
images and pictures).

(b) Auditory Learners:
— Auditory learners acquire knowledge through
sound, primarily through listening.
- Aspects such as pitch, volume, tempo, rhythm,
and resonance are significant for auditory
learners.
— They may be aural learners (learn by listening
to others) or oral learners (learn by talking and
hearing themselves).

(c) Motor Learners:
—Motor learners learn best through physical activity.
— Various aspects of action, such as frequency,
duration, intensity, and pressure, matter to them.
— Motor learners can be kinesthetic learners (use
gross motor muscles) or mechanical learners
(employ fine motor muscles in their learning).

1.31

Classroom Styles of Learning:

In addition to learning styles, learners in the

classroom can have various approaches:

(i) Intuitive: Rely on insights and hunches.

(ii) Inductive: Move from facts to
generalizations.

(iii) Deductive: Start with theory and apply it to
individual facts.

(iv) Reflective: Engage in introspection as part
of the learning process:

5. Learner Characteristics on the Basis of Listening
Skills: Listening is an important skill and there are
four types of listening styles, which are as follows:
(a) Active Listening: It is listening with a purpose.
(b) Empathic Listening: It is a form of active listening in

which you attempt to understand the other person.
(c) Evaluative Listening or Critical Listening: In
this type, the listener evaluates the accuracy,
meaningfulness and utility of speaker’s message.
(d) Appreciative Listening: Listening for enjoyment
involves seeking situations involving relaxing, fun
or emotionally stimulating information.

6. Learner Characteristics on the Basis of Thinking
Styles: There are different thinking styles of learners,
which are mentioned below.

(a) Reflective thinkers
(i) View new information with respect to the
subject.
(ii) Relate new information to past experiences.
(iii) Always ask ‘why?’
(iv) Examine their feelings about what they are
learning.
(b) Creative thinkers
(i) Like to play with new information.
(ii) Always ask ‘why?’
(iii) Create their own solutions and shortcuts.
(c) Practical thinkers
(i) Always look for factual information.
(ii) Seek the simplest and the most efficient
way to do their work.
(iii) Not satisfied until they know how to apply
their new skills to their job or other interest.
(d) Conceptual thinkers
(i) Accept new information only after seeing
the big picture.
(ii) Want to know how things work, not just the
final outcome.
(iii) Learn the concepts that are presented but
also want to know the related concepts that
may not have been included.

Fleming’s VARK Model of Learning

This model suggests four types of learners: visual, audi-
tory, read/write, and kinesthetic. It was developed by Neil
Fleming in 1987.

CHARACTERISTICS OF ADOLESCENT AND ADULT
Learners: ACADEMIC, SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL AND
COGNITIVE

Live as if you were to die tomorrow
Learn as if you were to live forever
— Mahatama Gandhi

Learning is a fundamental, continuous and lifelong process.
It is for our successful adaptation of human beings to inter-
nal and external environment. It should be according to the
physical and intellectual ability of the learner. Both teachers
and learners must be aware of this fact. Here, we are first
going to discuss concepts of adolescent and adult learning
and thereafter compare both.

ia Adolescence Learners

Adolescence means ‘to emerge’ to achieve ‘identity’. It is a
time for the maturing of mind and behaviours. It is not an
age, but a stage. It is divided into three major stages:

1. Early Adolescence (10 to 12 years): This stage
marks the growth of hands, feet and later the limbs.
There is demand for independence and privacy, so
there are chances of conflict.

2. Middle Adolescence (12 to 16 years): There are
further bodily and genetic developments, specifically
in girls.

Girls develop personal skills in a quicker manner,
and the loyalty and commitment matter more at this
stage. The decisions of vocations and education are
made. The physical effect of pubertal development
becomes incorporated into the self-image.

3. Late Adolescence (16 to 19 years): It is transforma-
tion towards the phase of adulthood. In late adoles-
cence, career decisions are finally traced. The child
gradually returns to the family on a new footing.

WHO defines adolescence in terms of age, spanning
the ages between 10 and 19 years. Hall describes ado-
lescence as a ‘storm and stress’ period that reflects the
unsettling growth period in modern societies. This con-
cept was recognized by Margaret Mead also.

Academically, adolescence is the time spent in high
schools and early colleges.

Psychologically, it is a period of transition, during
which cognitive, physical, personality and social changes
occur.

Sociologically, it is a period that fills the gap between
dependent childhoods to self-sufficient adulthood. From
a medical point of view, adolescence begins with hor-
monal changes and the growth of the body.

Delayed Adolscence: In India, the adolescent is depend-
ent on his parents for many more years in comparison to
the Western nations. The emotional dependence is also
termed as ‘Delayed Adolescence’ that can go upto 21 years
and even up to 25 years.

Teaching Aptitude

Acapemic ACHIEVEMENTS

Adolescents spend more waking time in school. Academic
achievement during this stage is predicted by interper-
sonal (parental engagement), intrapersonal (intrinsic
motivation), and institutional factors. It can set the stage
for future career opportunities. Sports, games, arts and
crafts also play some role. Parents put greater efforts dur-
ing this stage. «

Malcom Knowles has identified the following charac-
teristics of adult learners:

1. More autonomous and self-directed

2. Goal-oriented and practical

3. Relevance-oriented and see a reason for learning
something.

4. Adults must be shown respect. The adult trainers
must acknowledge the wealth of experiences that
adult participants bring to the classroom.

Nowadays, children know more, learn more, and want
more. This may lead to arguments, friction and tears, all
leading to a ‘cultural gap’ from their parents.

Adults learn voluntarily. They require more time to prac-
tice new skills. They have many responsibilities and have
less time to learn. They prefer to learn by participation.

As they have their own self-esteem and ego, they evalu-
ate learning in terms of results, and its utility to their life
situations.

SociaL CHANGES

* Margaret Mead emphasized the influence of cultural
factors on adolescent personality development.

* She observed that the transition from childhood to
adulthood, often referred to as ‘storm and stress,’ can
be relatively stress-free in certain societies.

* Harold W. Bernard also saw this transition as a cul-
tural phenomenon.

Cultural Aspects of Adolescence

1. Rapidly Widening Life: Adolescence is marked by an
expanding range of experiences and responsibilities.

2. Increasing Overlap between Child and Adult Roles:
Adolescents may find themselves taking on adult roles
and responsibilities while still navigating the chal-
lenges of childhood.

Challenges Faced by Adolescents

1. Conflicts, Values, and Emotional Tension: Adoles-
cents may grapple with conflicting values, emotions,
and extreme attitudes.

2. Industrialization and Urbanization: These societal
changes can lead to increased incidents of juvenile
delinquency. ‘

3. Transition Period: Adolescence is a transitional
period characterized by rapid physical changes and a
growing awareness of rights and duties.

Factors Impacting Adolescence

1. Search for Self-Concept: Adolescents seek to under-
stand their self-identity.

2. Desire for Independence: They yearn for more inde-
pendence and autonomy in decision-making.

3. Moral Considerations: Adolescents contemplate
moral values and ethics.

4. Peer Pressure: The influence of peers becomes more
pronounced.

5. Communication: Adolescents communicate through
various mediums like the internet, cell phones, and
social media.

Effects on Socialization
The process of socialization is influenced during adolescence.

1. Peer Relationships:

* Adolescents spend more time with friends during
‘homophily, and peer groups become more mixed-sex.

* Negative peer pressure can lead to problematic behav-
ior, while friends may provide support.

2. Social Groups:

¢ Adolescents form different types of social groups,
including ‘crowds’ and ‘cliques.’

* Romantic relationships during this stage are typically
short-lived.

3. Self-Efficacy:

¢ Self-efficacy refers to an individual’s belief in their
ability to succeed in various situations.

¢ Psychologist Albert Bandura highlighted the sig-
nificance of self-efficacy in influencing behavior,
thoughts, and emotions.

EMoTIONAL CHANGES

Adolescent Development and Emotions

1. Emotions and Learning:
¢ Research suggests emotions are intertwined with
intellect (learning), it means that emotions can’t be
separated from learning.
* High stress and anxiety hinder the learning process.

2. Role Confusion:
* Role confusion can signal challenges in success-
fully navigating adolescence.
3. Adolescent Characteristics:
¢ Adolescents grapple with issues of morality and
ambition.
¢ They value freedom and democratic principles.
¢ Prefer a permissive environment with leniency
from parents and teachers.
¢ Often exhibit rebellious tendencies.
4. Formation of Conscience: °
* Adolescents experience the development of con-
science that is called as ‘conscience formation’ dur-
ing this stage.
¢ They show a personal interest in religion, God,
worship, prayer, and spiritual values.

PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGES

1. Physical Changes:
e According to Hall, significant physical changes during
adolescence lead to psychological transformations.
2. Personality Formation:
¢ Adolescent years are crucial for personality
development.
¢ Anne believed that libido, dormant during latency
years, reawakens in adolescence, impacting the
ego and id balance.
3. Identity Development:
¢ Erik Erickson’s theory highlights the resolution of
identity conflicts during adolescence. (This has
been put separately also).
4. Gender Differences:
* Early puberty and cognitive changes affect girls
more than boys.
¢ Impacts decision-making abilities

Emotional Changes and Individual Variations

1. Unique Emotional Changes:

* A combination of genetics, brain development,
environment, experiences, and culture shapes
emotional development.

* Adolescents become self-conscious about physical
appearance and changes. .

¢ Exhibit ‘invincible’ thinking and behaviour.

2. Egoistic Needs:

* Adolescents have various egoistic needs, including
dominance, achievement, attention, autonomy,
and more.

3. Maturity Gap:

* Moffitt’s Theory suggests adolescent-limited anti-

social behaviour results from a ‘maturity gap.’

4. Differential Susceptibility Model:
* Genetic changes interacting with environmental
factors lead to differential susceptibility.
* Some variations are riskier than others.
5. Individual Differences:
* Individual differences play a significant role in ado-
lescent development.

Challenges Faced by Adolescents

‘Unholy Triad’: Substance abuse, violence, and early
sexual experimentation sum up the challenges faced by
adolescents.

The list of challenges is very long. Emotional
Turbulence, Identity Exploration, Conflict with
Parents, Academic Pressure, Body Image Concerns,
Romantic Relationships, Mood Disorders, Bullying and
Cyberbullying, Social Media, Peer Conflict, Sexuality
and Gender Identity, Emotional Regulation, Loneliness
and Isolation, Lack of Coping Skills.

Emotional Intelligence (EI): The concept of ‘emotional
intelligence’ was popularized by Daniel Goleman in 1995.
Elis a set of skills for the purposes of

1. The accurate appraisal and expression of emotions in
oneself and in others

2. The effective regulation of emotion in self and others,
and

3. The use of feelings to motivate, plan, and achieve in
one’s life.

Mayer and Salovey (1997) proposed that EI was a cogni-
tive ability which is separate but also associated to, general
intelligence. Their model consists of four different abilities:

1. Perception of emotion: In yourself and others

2. Emotional facilitation: The ability of emotions to
help thinking

3. Understanding emotions: To judge the emotional.con-
tent of several stimuli such as faces, designs and colours.

4. Management of emotions

Mayer and Salovey offered us a test, called as Mayer
Salovey Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT).

The inability to recognize or describe one’s own
emotions is called as ‘alexithymia’.

Baron’s (2006) Model of Emotional Social Intelligence
(ESI) consists of intrapersonal (emotional awareness, asser-
tiveness, independence, self regard, self actualization);
interpersonal (empathy, social responsibility, interpersonal
relationships), stress management (stress tolerance, impulse
control); and general mood (happiness and optimism).

Multiple intelligences: This tries to differentiate human
intelligence into specific ‘modalities’, rather than focus
on a single general ability. This concept was described by
Howard Gardner in his 1983 book ‘Frames of Mind’: The
Theory of Multiple Intelligences. According to the theory,
an intelligence ‘modality must fulfill eight established cri-
teria which are Linguistic, Logical/Mathematical, Spatial,
Bodily-Kinesthetic, Musical, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal,
and Naturalist.

Erikson’s Mopbe or PsycHosociaL DEVELOPMENT

Erikson’s eight stages of psychosocial development is
a valuable framework for understanding how people
develop socially and emotionally throughout the lifespan.
The successful resolution of each stage leads to the devel-
opment of a new psychosocial strength.

Teaching Aptitude

1. Infancy: Trust vs. Mistrust - Infants develop trust or
mistrust based on the consistency and reliability of
their caregivers.

2. Toddlerhood: Autonomy versus Shame and Doubt
- Toddlers seek to assert independence and control
over their actions.

3. Preschool: Initiative versus Guilt - Preschoolers begin to
explore their surroundings and take on new challenges.

4. Elementary school: Industry versus Inferiority —
Children focus onmastering newskills and competencies.

5. Adolescence: Identity versus Role Confusion -
Adolescents grapple with questions of identity and
self-discovery.

6. Young adulthood: Intimacy versus Isolation —- Young
adults seek meaningful relationships and intimacy.

7. Middle adulthood: Generativity versus Stagnation —
These adults in the middle stage focus on contribut-
ing to society and future generations.

8. Late adulthood: Integrity versus Despair - Individu-
als in the late stage reflect on their life and develop a
sense of integrity or despair.

It assists in guiding individuals’ growth and highlighting
challenges in each life stage, leading to the development
of specific strengths. For instance, resolving the trust ver-
sus mistrust conflict in infancy fosters hope.

Coenitive DEVELOPMENT
Let’s discuss an important miodel first:

Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO):
SOLO model is a valuable tool for understanding and
assessing learners’ cognitive development. It can be
used to design instruction that helps learners to achieve
higher levels of understanding. It was proposed by John
B. Biggs and Kevin F. Collis in 1982.

The SOLO taxonomy consists of five levels:

1. Pre-structural: The student does not understand the
task or the concepts involved.

2. Uni-structural: The student has a basic understand-
ing of one aspect of the task or concept.

3. Multi-structural: The student has a basic under-
standing of several aspects of the task or concept, but
they are not integrated.

4. Relational: The student has a deep understanding of
the task or concept and is able to integrate the differ-
ent aspects into a coherent whole.

5. Extended abstract: The student has a sophisticated
understanding of the task or concept and is able to
apply it to new and unfamiliar situations.

This refers to intelligence, thinking and imagination
about our environment. Our innate power (heredity) also
plays an important role in it.

Piaget mentioned the following stages for cognitive
development:

1. Sensorimotor period (0-2 years)
2. Pre-operational period (2-7 years)

1.35

3. Concrete operation period (7-11 years)
4. Formal operation period (11-15 years)

The main characteristics displayed here are:

1. Systematic analysis of a problem

2. Logical approach towards the solution of problem — to
move away from rote learning.

3. Ability to use higher order structure to solve a problem

4. Systematic analysis of a problem

5. Moral maturity

It has been observed that the type of language used in
uneducated homes is mostly of commands, whereas in
educated homes, it is mostly of explanations. Individuals
struggle through environmental changes. Through this
process of adaptation, cognitive development takes place.
The purpose of this process of adjustment is to bring about
a ‘state of equilibrium’ in the life of individuals.

At adolescence stage, social interaction plays a very sig-
nificant role in learning. Readymade solutions of problems
should be discouraged. The teachers should provide such
type of education that helps to form minds which can be
critical, can verify and not accept everything that is offered.

At the stage of formal operation, the child displays
three new qualities:

1. Systematic analysis (with all possible solutions) of the
problem

2. Logical approach

3. Ability to use higher order structure

There is no knowledge development without relating
objects within the environment. An individual acquires
knowledge not by passively copying objects in the envi-
ronment but by acting upon it.

Apu tt LEARNERS

Overall, learning is a valuable experience that can benefit
adults in many ways. Even if adults are busy, they should
try to find time to learn new things.

Figure 1.13 Adult Learner as per Malcolm S. Knowles

Adult education follows a philosophy called ‘andragogy,’
focusing on helping adults learn effectively. The princi-
ples of adult learning aim to achieve:

Changing what adults know
Changing what they can do
Changing how they think
Changing what they actually do

1.36

In simpler terms, adult education should lead to
changes in the learner’s knowledge, attitude, and skills.
Adulthood is defined based on age or cognitive maturity.
In India, it’s typically between 15 and 35 years, while
UNESCO and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development define it as 24 to 65 years. Adult learn-
ing can take various forms, including formal, non-formal,
or informal settings, self-guided or sponsored by organi-
zations, and can be full-time or part-time.

Ficure 1.14 Characteristics of Learning by an
Adult Learner

Important Characteristics of Adulthood

Adults are different from children when it comes to
learning. As people grow up, they become more inde-
pendent and self-directed. This transition happens in
adulthood.

Adults learn through their life experiences and often
have a lot of knowledge. Sometimes, they might even
know more than their teachers.

As people mature, they want to learn things that are
relevant to their lives, especially when it comes to their
social roles and responsibilities. Learning must have prac-
tical applications.

Novel styles = - adoittenrniig Experience

Figure 1.15 Principles of Adult Learning

Adults start to see the value in learning for immediate
use, and they enjoy solving real-life problems. Their moti-
vation to learn comes from within, and they take respon-
sibility for their learning.

In India, adult learners are those who didn’t have the
chance for formal education when they were younger.

To understand the differences between adolescent and
adult learners, we need to look at their unique characteristics.

Figure 1.16 Effective Teaching

QUALITIES OF AN EFFECTIVE TEACHER

Personal Qualities:

— Warmth, affection, and sympathy

— Democratic and optimistic approach
- Dynamic and engaging personality

Professional Competencies:

— Strong command over the subject matter
— Effective communication skills

— Skillful use of teaching resources

— Classroom management abilities

- Proficiency in assessing students’ learning

Teaching Skills Classification:

1. Core Teaching Skills:
— Applicable to all subjects and areas of teaching

2. Specific Teaching Skills:
Tailored for particular subject areas like language,
social science, science, mathematics, etc.

3. Target Group-Specific Skills:
Geared towards teaching exceptional children and
diverse student populations.

Some factors as practised by teachers in classroom are as
follows:

1. A teacher with limited exposure and experience in
teaching is prone to
* follow textbook reading by the students
* transmit information through lecture
¢ dictate notes
¢ impart required information

2. A teacher with professional training and reflective
thinking is tempted to

adopt new ways to teach

involve students in teaching

generate new ideas through problem-solving

teach through group activities

follow cooperative learning

adopt interactive approach

At different stages of teaching, with added experience, a
teacher goes on enriching a higher style of teaching. This
is indicative of the teacher’s growth in higher professional
pursuits.

1.37

Metacore skills and Polycrest skills: A teacher should
prioritize clear communication, diverse teaching tech-
niques, task-centered lessons, and student engagement.
Like professionals in other fields, a teacher should have
a range of teaching skills, including core skills for gen-
eral teaching and specialized skills for specific situations.
These specialized skills are referred to as ‘Polycrest skills.’

LEARNING Factors
In effective learning, we mostly notice these factors:

More intensity of learning

More retention

Joyful learning

More scope of cognitive development
Self-directed learning
Self-motivation for further learning

DS) ls

Keeping the above in consideration, the following factors
become automatically important:

1. Background of the learner (repertoire)

2. Nature of learning material (easy or difficult)

3. Environmental factors (space, physical condition and
psychological support)

4. Motivation (intrinsic and extrinsic)

5. Learning support can be human (teachers and par-
ents) or electronic (audio, video and computer).

Certain qualities and traits of learners, such as their
level of intelligence, their attitudes, their motivation,
their learning styles, aptitudes, their readiness to take
risks, etc. can impact the way they learn. Many factors
have been defined under the learning topic itself.

TEACHER Support MATERIAL

Support materials aim to help teachers and students
achieve the learning goals of a subject. These resources
offer ideas and tools but aren’t strict or exhaustive.
Teachers and students can explore various ways to meet
these goals, including using books, practical exercises, or
specific activities. For instance:

1. Teacher Solutions Manual (TSM): These guides
assist teachers in effective teaching by offering sug-
gestions on how to teach a topic. They provide com-
prehensive supplementary resources, offering end-to-
end solutions.

2. Lecture slides: While teachers create their own
teaching materials for class lectures, lecture slides
offer a solid foundation for instructors to build upon.

3. Extra practice questions: Students often ask for more
practice. Textbooks include additional exercise ques-
tions, case studies, and similar materials that teachers
can use to create homework, quizzes, and tests.

LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND INSTITUTIONS

The learning environment is like a setting for learning,
closely connected to teaching and education. It has its
roots in philosophy and is influenced by various factors
like democracy, autocracy, laissez-faire, and the broader



=== Page 20 ===
1.38

Chapter 1

political, cultural, and legal context. Internally, it involves
teachers, teaching methods, learning principles, and
evaluation processes. Institutional setup also plays a cru-
cial role in shaping the learning environment. Since the
social, political, and industrial landscape is always chang-
ing, the learning environment must be adaptable.

INSTRUCTIONAL FACILITIES

I hear and J forget, I see and I believe, I do and
Tunderstand.
—Confucius

Instructional facilities are tools that support teaching and
learning. They complement teaching methods and rely on
‘give’ and ‘take’ interactions in the learning process. These
facilities include audiovisual resources, enhancing learn-
ing through sensory experiences. They aid in better reten-
tion, recall, thinking, engagement, imagination, assimila-
tion, and personal growth.

Key benefits are as follows:

1. Aims to engage learners with various stimuli

2. Follows teaching maxims, making it systematic

3. Enhances information retention with sensory
engagement

4. Fosters positive attitudes through visuals and models

5. Instructional facilities, or teaching learning materials
(TLMs), improve teaching effectiveness and enhance
learners’ retention.

6. They make the learning process more efficient, help-
ing students achieve their learning goals after class-
room sessions.

7. Various types of teaching instructional facilities are
used in classrooms for these reasons.

8. Organizes teaching for better delivery, learning, and
retention.

9. Supports holistic learning with diverse objectives.

10. Promotes scientific thinking, a key educational goal.

11. Demonstrates practical applications of theoretical
knowledge.

12. Adds an element of fun to learning.

13. Helps form and understand abstract concepts, reduc-
ing rote learning.

Hersey-Blanchard Model of Leadership: Under this
model, it focuses on employees’ ability and willingness,
often referred to as Situational Leadership, and thus it
includes D (Directive) and S (Supportive) categories.

Nature of learner (or member):

D1 - Unable and unwilling
D2 - Unable willing

D3 - Able unwilling

D4 - Able willing

Approaches to be adopted:

$1 - Directing
S2 - Coaching
S3 - Supporting
S4 - Delegating

For example, if a candidate is able and unwilling, he must
be supported. Able and willing candidate must be delegated
some task to show the results.

EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
Educational technology comes in two types:

1. Hardware approach: This involves using machines
and devices to teach more students at a lower cost.
It uses technology like teaching machines, radio, TV,
tape recorders, projectors, etc.

2. Software approach: Educationist B F Skinner was
also associated with it. This focuses on behavioural
aspects such as teaching skills and knowledge. It
covers teaching objectives, methods, reinforcement,
feedback, and more. It uses materials like newspa-
pers, books, games, and flashcards to develop the
technology’s input, process, and output.

Types OF INSTRUCTIONAL FACILITIES

According to the senses involved, educational technology
can be divided into audio, visual and audio-video instruc-
tional facilities.

1, Audio instructional facilities: The quality of voice
is assumed to be very important as it has direct effect.
We spend more than 50% of our time in hearing.
This reflects the importance of the audio media in
our life. Examples of audio instructional facilities
include language labs, radio sets, sound distribution
sets, etc.

2. Visual instructional facilities: This is linked with
‘seeing’. Examples include posters, flashcards, charts,
bulletin boards, maps, models, photographs, etc.

3. Audio-visual instructional facilities: These ‘heard
and seen’ messages create a tripolar process of moti-
vation, classification and stimulation. Out of five
senses, seeing at 87% and hearing at 7% are the
major ones to attract attention and increase learn-
ing. Examples of audio-visual instructional facilities
include television, video films, documentary films,
etc.

FUNCTIONS OF AUDIO-VISUAL INSTRUCTIONAL FacILITIES
These perform the following functions:

1. More clarity and understanding

Better attention, interest and retention

It helps in faster and comprehensive learning
Better access

Save the instructor’s time

Supplement the spoken words by combining audio
and visual stimuli

Se aS

Limitations OF AUDIO-VISUAL INSTRUCTIONAL FACILITIES

1. If instructional materials are lacking, learners might
misunderstand.

2. Teaching might focus on only a few key concepts, leav-
ing out important details. Being a passive observer
instead of actively participating is called ‘spectatorism.’

3. Active inquiry is needed.

4. Multimedia includes various media types like audio,
text, images, animations, graphics, videos, and films.
Using the right mix is vital for effective learning.

Tyres OF INSTRUCTIONAL FaciLitiEs AccoRDING TO PROJECTION oR SHOW

Projected Visual Instructional
Facilities

Any visual instructional facilities that is used for magnifi-
cation of image ona screen in dark or semi-dark conditions
can be called a projected visual instructional facility. There
are three important methods of projection and they are:

1. Direct Projection: Slide and film projectors

2. Indirect Projection: Overhead projector
3. Reflected Projection: Opaque projector and epidiascope

SLIDES

Aslide is a see-through picture that’s shown by shining light
through it. You can project it on a screen or a white wall.
These slides are often 35 mm films placed in cardboard or
plastic frames. People use them a lot in training, seminars,
workshops, meetings, campaigns, and exhibitions.

OveRHEAD Provector (OHP)

An OHP uses light to project a big image from small docu-
ments or pictures onto a screen for a large audience. But
it’s not used much nowadays.

HANDHELD PROJECTOR

This is a small projector you can carry in your hand. It’s
used in devices like phones and cameras to show pictures
or presentations on a small screen.

Vipeo Provector (DicitaL PROJECTOR)

Video projectors are popular for various uses today. They
use bright light to project images.

-Concept Box

Mind Mapping

Tony Buzan created this concept in 1974. A mind
map is like a picture that helps you organize infor-
mation. You start with a main idea in the center,
like a drawing, and then add related ideas around
it, like words or pictures. People use it a lot for
things like presentations, brainstorming, and mak-
ing decisions in projects. It is a way to see and
organize ideas visually.

Microsoft PowerPoint Presentations

Microsoft PowerPoint is a program for making pres-
entations. It was made in 1987 by Robert Gaskins
and Dennis Austin. It creates slides with informa-
tion, charts, pictures, and more. You can also record
and add videos to it. People use it for business and
school presentations. You can use other tools like
Canva, Adobe Express, Mid Journey (which uses

AI), and Generative AI to make designs too.

Non-projected Visual Instructional
Facilities

These facilities are used without projectors. Theyre easy
to get, don’t need special power, are affordable, and sim-
ple to handle. They work well for small groups. Many can
be turned into projected learning tools. For example, you
can take pictures or scans of charts, flannel graphs, and
flashcards and turn them into slides. Some can even be
used with an opaque projector.

CHARTS

Charts are quite useful. They let stddents see ideas
in an organized way. These visual aids help students
understand and connect ideas better. You can display
the charts in the classroom according to the lesson
plan. They are visually appealing and help emphasize
important points.

Types of Charts
There are different types of charts, each serving a specific
purpose:

1. Process charts: These show steps in a process, like
insect life cycles or energy cycles.

2. Organizational charts: They represent hierar-
chal relationships and communication flow within
organizations.

3. Time charts: Used for events in chronological order,
such as the evolution of man or political empires.

Teaching Aptitude

4, Tabular charts: Present data in a table for easy com-
parison, like types of plantations.

5. Tree charts: Depict growth from one source into
many branches, as seen in family trees.

6. Stream charts: Show multiple branches converging
into a single stream, like rivers flowing into the sea.

7, Sequence charts or flip charts: A collection of charts
that display events or series of events in succession.
They are bound together and can be flipped over like
acalendar.

Different instructional materials are used for various
purposes:

1. Flash cards: These are brief visual messages on poster
board, used to emphasize key points during a presen-
tation. They are shown one at a time in sequence with
the talk.

2. Posters: Posters are displayed in public places to cre-
ate awareness. They provide initial information but
usually require additional resources like leaflets or
demonstrations for more details. Making good post-
ers requires technical skills and time, and a new one is
needed for each occasion.

3. Captions: Attractive text on a poster that conveys the
main message and complements the visual aspect.

4. Pictures and photographs: Visual representations cre-
ated through drawing, painting, or photography. They
can convey information effectively without words.

5. Graphs: Images that symbolically represent data.
Different types, such as bar graphs, line graphs,
scatter graphs, and pictographs, simplify complex
information.

6. Maps: Visual representations of areas, highlighting
relationships between elements like objects, regions,
and themes. Cartography is the practice of creating
maps.

Maps are useful tools in various disciplines, espe-
cially in social studies for learning geographical, his-
torical, and economic concepts.

7. Diagrams: Diagrams are visual representations,
such as plans, sketches, drawings, or outlines, used
to explain processes or illustrate the relationships
between parts of a whole.

Display boards are instructional materials that facilitate
teaching. These includes the following:

1. Blackboard or Chalkboard: An old yet widely used
non-projected visual instructional tool. It is simple,
cost-effective, and suitable for lectures, training pro-
grams, and group meetings. It allows step-by-step
presentations, sustains interest, and aids audience
note-taking, comprehension, and retention.

2. Whiteboard: Also known as a marker board, dry-
erase board, or pen-board. They gained popular-
ity in the 1990s and have a smooth surface for non-
permanent markings. Whiteboards can be used for
projections.

1.41

. Bulletin Board: Used to display bulletins, news,

announcements, and information of general or spe-
cific interest. They come in various sizes with pin-
holding capabilities.

. Flannel Board and Flannel Graph: Visual instruc-

tional materials where messages are written or drawn
on thick paper and presented step by step to synchro-
nize with the talk. The board has a flannel-covered
flat surface, and the messages are moved on it.

. Magnetic Board: A board with a steel base and a

porcelain-like surface. Pictures and objects can be
attached and moved with small magnets

. Peg Board: This is a hardboard with evenly spaced

holes that can accept pegs or hooks for supporting
various items, such as tools in a workshop.
Three-dimensional Models: Models represent real
objects in three dimensions (height, width, and depth)
when the real things are not available or are not in the
desired form. There are three types of models: solids,
cutaway or cross sections, and working models, They
provide a realistic and illustrative way to understand
complex objects and concepts, and they are durable
and cost-effective.

Objects, Specimens, and Globe: Objects are collec-
tions of real items used for instructional purposes.
Specimens represent typical objects of a class or

1.

Radio: Radio has been a popular mass medium for
nearly a century. It offers easy access, speed, and
immediacy. Radio has been used for mass educa-
tion, with the first radio station in India established
in Mumbai in 1927. All India Radio (AIR) broadcasts
educational programs, and Gyan Vani is a dedicated
FM channel for educational broadcasts. Additionally,
Central Institute of Educational Technology (CIET) of
NCERT develops audio programs for school children
broadcast by Gyan Vani.

. Podcast: Podcasts are personalized broadcasts tailored

for specific learning objectives. They are made avail-
able to a target audience and provide a flexible and on-
demand way of learning. The term ‘podcast’ combines
‘pod’ from iPod and ‘cast’ from broadcasting.
Recordings: Tape recorders or other audio recording
devices are suitable for extension work in meetings,
training programs, campaigns, and recording radio
programs. They allow on-the-spot sound recording,
are easy to operate and preserve, and have low opera-
tional costs as tapes can be reused.

Digital Audio Player: A digital audio player, often
referred to as an MP3 player, is designed for stor-
ing, organizing, and playing audio files. Some digital
audio players, like the iPod (fourth generation audio
instructional facilities), also support image viewing
and video playback.

. Telephone and Mobile: Telephones enable commu-

nication between two people at a time, and with the

addition of speakers, systems like Cell Phone-Operated
Mobile Audio Communication and Conference
System (COMBACCS) can serve many people in a
given area. SMS and WAP-enabled cell phones with
cameras are effective for extending communication
between experts and the public. COMBACCS facili-
tates relationship-building and understanding among
community members in different locations.

6. Television: Television is effective for conveying abstract
concepts and ideas. It uses animation and visual experi-
mentation to make abstract concepts concrete.

Activity INSTRUCTIONAL FACILITIES

1. Field Trip: Field trips are structured activities con-
ducted outside the classroom, providing students
with exposure to real people, events, and opportuni-
ties to connect with others.

2. Experimentation: Experiments are especially useful
in science subjects to connect theory with practice.

3. Dramatics: Dramatics involve theme-based perfor-
mances where students play different roles to convey
messages to society or the public.

Learning Method

Reading

These facilities can be used individually or together,
depending on certain factors:

1. Audience Type: Use printed materials for literate
audiences and exhibits, pictures, and symbols for less
literate ones.

2. Audience Size: For groups larger than 30, avoid
video or whiteboard presentations; opt for the inter-
net for larger audiences.

3. Teaching Objectives: Choose audio-visual tools
based on your teaching objective, whether it is
to change thinking, attitude, or actions. Mass
media like radio or TV work for broad information
dissemination.

Date’s Cone oF EXPERIENCE

The Dale Cone of Experience is a model developed by
Edgar Dale in the 1940s, showing different levels of learn-
ing experiences and how effective they are for learning.
Here’s a simplified version:

Teaching Aptitude

Dale Cone of Experience Helps Teachers

The Dale Cone of Experience is useful for educators
because it:

1. Guides Effective Instruction: Teachers choose the
right learning experience based on objectives, such as
hands-on activities for practical skills.

2. Engages Learners: It helps design interactive les-
sons for different learning styles, encouraging active
participation.

3. Shapes Assessment: Teachers align assessments
with the learning experience, using practical tasks for
hands-on learning.

4. Encourages Variety: The model suggests varying
instructional methods to make learning dynamic and
interesting.

5. Allows Adaptation: Teachers can adjust strategies
based on resources and student needs, even if hands-
on materials are limited.

Tips for Better Classroom
Management

In the NET examination, questions about handling class
indiscipline often come up. When dealing with students
who misbehave in class, teachers need to keep a few
things in mind. First and foremost, the teacher should
avoid causing any physical or emotional harm to the stu-
dents. Our goal is to help them improve their behavior,
not harm them.

If any punishments are necessary, they should be fair
and reasonable, never cruel. The teacher’s ability to man-
age a group of students depends on their personality and
the relationship they build with the students. Here are
some important tips to remember:

1. Immediate Action: Whena student misbehaves, the
teacher should take immediate action. By pausing
the teaching, it is clear that misbehavior won’t be
tolerated.

2. Change Seats: If a few students disrupt the class, con-
sider changing their seats. Separating troublemakers
can be effective in controlling indiscipline.

3. Adapt and Be Sensitive: If the whole class seems to
be losing control, it might mean the current activity
is boring. Teachers can regain control by changing
the activity. For example, switching from reading toa
writing task can engage them better. Teachers should
be adaptable and sensitive to the class’s mood.

4. Counseling After Class: One of the most effective
ways to handle a student is by providing counseling
after class. The teacher can also explain the conse-
quences of not improving.

5. Talk to Parents: Sometimes, having a conversation
with the parents can improve a student’s behavior. It
can also provide insights into the reasons for individ-
ual students’ indiscipline.

and has beneficial effects, both physical and
psychological.

Everyone loves a teacher with an infectious sense
of humour.

It builds cordial relationship.

It has the ability to relax people and reduce tension.
It is an effective advertising strategy.

Teaching with the help of cartoons is a very
effective way.

Students enjoy humour in forms of funny anecdotes.

| Evaluation Systems

INTERDEPENDENCE OF TEACHING, LEARNING, AND
EVALUATION

Teaching is about helping students learn, which involves
acquiring knowledge, skills, attitudes, habits, and abili-
ties. To check if teaching is effective and to what extent,
we use evaluation. Teaching, learning, and evaluation
are all connected in education. This connection becomes
evident when we aim to help students achieve learning
outcomes that include changes in thinking, doing, and
feeling. We can look at the following diagram which tries
to balance and align the three in a specific manner.

ME Chapter |

In education, there are four important factors: objec-
tives, curriculum, methods, and evaluation. These factors
are closely related. Evaluation is seen as a continuous pro-
cess, integral to education, and linked to educational goals.
It not only measures achievement but also helps improve it.

Evaluation is a systematic process that involves col-
lecting, analyzing, and interpreting information to assess
if instructional objectives are met. Beeby’s definition of
evaluation includes four key elements:

1. Systematic collection of evidence (like scores)
2. Interpreting this evidence

3. Making a judgment of value

4. Taking action based on this judgment.

DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF EVALUATION

1. Comprehensive: That is covering all aspects.
Evaluation should consider all aspects of a child’s
development, using various methods to assess their
performance.

2. Continuous: It should be ongoing process to the
extent possible. Evaluation isn’t just a one-time test,
it’s continuous throughout education. There’s no fixed
deadline, and it’s part of the ongoing assessment.
CBSE’s Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation
(CCE) follows these principles, helping identify stu-
dents’ learning challenges regularly from the start of
the academic year and providing appropriate support
to improve their learning.

Difference between Measurement, Assessment
and Evaluation

Measurement: It quantifies learning through numerical
data, such as a math test score out of 100. This provides
a specific numerical value of a student’s understanding.
For example, an 80 in English or a 75 in History would be
direct measurements of a student’s performance in those
subjects.

Gathering information => [° Measurement
v

Assessment: This is a broader term than measurement.
It involves collecting a wide range of data to gauge a stu-
dent’s learning. This includes not just quantitative data
like test scores, but also qualitative data such as class par-
ticipation, project work, and observations. For instance, a
teacher assessing a student in science might consider not
only quiz scores on the solar system but also the student’s
projects, participation in class discussions, and written
reflections. This comprehensive approach provides a
fuller picture of the student’s grasp of the topic.

Evaluation: This is the process of making judgments
based on the collected data, taking both measurement
and assessment into account. Evaluation is a higher-level

process where, for instance, a teacher evaluates a stu-
dent’s progress by considering all aspects of assessment
- test scores, projects, and class contributions. This could
involve deciding on the final grade or planning inter-
ventions for improvement. If students’ marks improve
or worsen, it is within this stage that the significance of
those changes is analyzed and understood in the context
of overall learning.

FUNCTIONS OF EVALUATION

Evaluation doesn’t stop at summarizing results; it plays a
crucial role in improving the entire system. Here are the
functions of evaluation:

1. Feedback: Identifying strengths and weaknesses

2. Motivation: Knowing that evaluation is coming

encourages students to work hard.

. Better Guidance: Important for student development

. Remediation: Locating areas needing improvement

. Facilitates Planning: Helps teachers plan and orga-

nize lessons .

. Curriculum Revision: Any changes in curriculum

undergo the changes in evaluation as well.

7. Comparison between institutions: Evaluation pat-
tern might be different between top-notch institutions
and others.

8. Educational Decision-making: Includes selection,
classification, placement, and promotion.

9. Sharing Evaluation Progress Reports: This helps
parents know the status and suggest measures for
progress.

Types OF EVALUATION

A teacher must gather evidence about changes in a stu-
dent’s behavior to assess progress. Here are various tech-
niques for this purpose:

Teaching Aptitude

1.45

Quantitative Techniques

1. Written Examination: Students answer questions in
writing.

2. Oral Examination: This includes reading tests, pro-
nunciation assessments, and viva voice.

3. Practical Examination: Tests for hands-on skills in
subjects like science, technology, agriculture, crafts,
and music.

Qualitative Techniques

1. Observation and Interviews: Observing students
systematically in controlled and uncontrolled situa-
tions. Interviews provide insights as students may be
more willing to talk than write.

2. Checklist: Collecting and recording evidence of sig-
nificant behavioral tendencies or specific classroom
problems.

3. Rating Scale: Quantifying judgments about situa-
tions, objects, or character.

4. Cumulative Records: Using anecdotal records,
cumulative record cards, and diaries to gather
detailed information about a child’s behavior.

Type OF EVALUATION ON THE BASIS OF PHASE OF

INSTRUCTION

Evaluation is an integral part of the instructional process
and takes four main forms:

1. Placement Evaluation: This occurs before a student
enters an institution. It assesses a learner’s skills and
knowledge at the time of admission.

Concept Box
Deeksharambh

This is basically a Student Induction Programme
(SIP). This helps new students adjust and feel com-
fortable in the new environment, inculcate in them
the ethos and culture of the institution, help them
build bonds with other students and faculty mem-
bers, and expose them to a sense of larger purpose
and self-exploration.

2. Formative Evaluation: This evaluation happens
throughout the instructional period. It includes

4. Summative

On the basis of phase On the basis of nature On the basis of

regular assessments like unit end exams, monthly
tests, and quarterly assessments. Formative evalu-
ation provides feedback to teachers about their
teaching effectiveness and helps students track their
progress.

3. Diagnostic Evaluation: Diagnostic evaluation
focuses on identifying and addressing learning dif-
ficulties. When a student consistently struggles with
certain concepts or subjects, a diagnostic test is con-
ducted to uncover the root causes of their difficulties
and provide appropriate remedies.

4. Summative Evaluation (External Evaluation):
Summative evaluation takes place at the end of a
course. It assesses the extent to which instructional
objectives have been met and is used for assigning
course grades. This evaluation includes activities like
oral reports, projects, term papers, and teacher-made
achievement tests to determine how well students
have achieved the instructional objectives.

EVALUATION ACCORDING TO NaTuRE OF REFERENCE

Norm-Referenced versus Criterion-Referenced Testing
Criterion-Referenced Evaluation
This type of testing measures an individual’s performance
against specific criteria or standards.

It focuses on an individual’s achievements within a
defined domain.

For example, saying ‘Amit scored 95% in Mathematics’
is a criterion-referenced evaluation because it references
an individual’s performance against a specific standard.

On the basis
of reference purpose of grades
1. Norm-referenced 1. Diagnostic tests Direct

2. Criterion-referenced 2. Aptitude tests

3. Achievementtests Indirect

4. Proficiency tests



=== Page 24 ===
1.46

MM chapter |

It is objective-based and assesses whether instructional
objectives have been met.

The success of this evaluation lies in clearly defining
levels of achievement based on instructional objectives.

Norm-Referenced Evaluation

Norm-referenced testing compares an individual’s perfor-
mance to the performance of others in a group.

It is often used in competitive exams or to rank indi-
viduals within a group.

For example, ‘Amit stood third in the Mathematics test’
is a norm-referenced evaluation because it compares one
person’s performance to that of others.

These tests can be relatively easy or tough, depending
on group performance.

The focus is on an individual’s relative standing within
a group.

Concept Box
Scholastic Assessment

Scholastic assessment refers to the assessment of
cognitive abilities of learners in various academic
activities that are associated with various subjects.
Therefore, all those abilities in cognitive domain,
namely, knowledge, understanding, application,
analysis, synthesis, evaluation and creativity come
under scholastic abilities. Continuous and compre-
hensive evaluation is one such example.

Reflective Prompts

Reflective prompts involve providing students with ques-
tions that encourage them to reflect on their own learning.
After completing a lesson or unit, each student answers
these questions.
These prompts help students think critically about
their learning process.

Types of Evaluation Tests Based on Purpose:

1. Diagnostic Test: Identifies areas in which a learner
may need remedial help and provides a profile of their
knowledge.

2. Aptitude Test: Predicts a person’s potential talents
and characteristics necessary for specific tasks.

3. Achievement Test: Measures the extent to which
course objectives have been achieved, often used at
the end of a course.

4. Proficiency Test: Assesses a person’s general abil-
ity and skills at a given time, typically based on the
expected abilities for a specific educational level.

GRADING SYSTEM OF EVALUATION

The word ‘grade’ is derived from the Latin word Gradus
which means ‘step’. In educational measurement, grading
involves the use of a set of symbols to communicate the
level of achievement of the students.

Grading Methods in Education
Direct Grading
1. Performance is assessed qualitatively, and the exam-
iner directly expresses impressions using letter grades.
2. Reduces variability among examiners but lacks
transparency.
Indirect Grading

Performance is first assessed in marks and then converted
into letter grades using various methods.

There are two types of indirect grading: Absolute
Grading and Relative Grading.

Absolute Grading
Follows pre-determined standards to categorize students
into letter grades.

Example:

75% and above
60% - less than 75%
45% - less than 60%
33% - less than 45%
Below 33%

Distinction

First Division
Second Division
Third Division
Unsatisfactory

Relative Grading

The grade depends on the student’s performance relative
to the group. Commonly known as ‘grading on the curve.’
Personality Tests - objective and projective.

Objective Tests

1. Self-reporting measures of personality traits,
answered with ‘yes’ or ‘no.’

2. Considered objective as they don’t involve manipula-
tion by the test maker.
Example: Locus of Control measures an individual’s
perception of the causes of events in their life.

Projective Tests

1. Designed for responses to ambiguous stimuli, reveal-
ing hidden emotions and internal conflicts.

2. Individuals project their thoughts and feelings onto
the test.
Example: Responding to questions based on ambigu-
ous stimuli.

ll Choice Based Credit System (CBCS)
The New Education Policy (NEP) is a reform effort by
the Ministry of Education in India. The University Grants
Commission (UGC) has also been actively involved in
improving the National Higher Education System, focus-
ing on fairness, efficiency, and academic excellence.
Many educational institutions have recently adopted
the semester system, aligning with international stan-
dards. To provide students with more choices and flex-

ibility, the education system should allow them to select
interdisciplinary, intra-disciplinary, and skill-based

Teaching Aptitude

1.47

courses. This flexibility can be achieved through the
adoption of the internationally recognized Choice-Based
Credit System (CBCS).

CBCS not only enables students to study core subjects
but also encourages them to explore additional areas of
interest. This approach promotes holistic development in
individuals.

Advantages of CBCS

1. Shifting Focus to Student-Centric Education:
— Education is moving away from being teacher-cen-
tered to student-centered.

2. Credit Flexibility for Students:
— Students can take on as many credits as they can
handle.
~ Failing in one or more courses doesn’t mean repeat-
ing all courses in the same semester.

3. Diverse Course Choices:
— Choice-Based Credit System (CBCS) allows students
to pick interdisciplinary and intra-disciplinary courses.
— Skill-oriented papers are available, even from other
fields, based on students’ interests and needs.
- CBCS aligns education with global standards and
encourages unique combinations like Physics with
Economics.

4. Flexibility in Learning:
CBCS offers flexibility in studying at different times
and institutions.
This enhances students’ mobility in pursuing their
education.

5. Credit Transfer:
— Credits earned at one institution can be transferred
to another.

6. Uniform Grading System:
-A uniform grading system helps potential employers
evaluate candidates consistently.
— The UGC has established guidelines for uniform
grading and computing the cumulative grade point
average (CGPA) based on exam performance.

OUTLINE OF CHoice BASED Crepit System

1. Core Course: These are courses that all candidates
must take as a mandatory part of their curriculum.

2, Elective Course: These courses offer choices from
a range of specialized, advanced, or subject-specific
options, allowing students to tailor their studies.

3. Discipline-Specific Elective (DSE) Course: These
electives are directly related to the main subject of
study but may also include interdisciplinary options.

4. Dissertation/Project: An elective course where stu-
dents gain specialized knowledge with guidance from
a faculty member.

5. Generic Elective (GE) Course: Electives chosen from
unrelated subjects to broaden knowledge.

6. Ability Enhancement Courses (AEC): These include
Ability Enhancement Compulsory Courses (AECC)
focused on knowledge enhancement and_ Skill
Enhancement Courses (SEC) that offer skill-based
learning.

Universities have some flexibility in core syllabi but must
adhere to at least 80% of the UGC’s common minimum
curriculum guidelines.

i) Computer-Based Testing (CBT)

Computer-Based Testing (CBT) drives changes in teach-
ing methods, learning, and educational content. It has
a profound impact on both computer-based and paper-
based testing.

BENEFITS OF CompuTen-BASED TESTING (CBT) |
1. More frequent testing opportunities.

2. Provides data-rich results.

3. Expands the reach of candidates.

4. Simplifies logistical processes.

There are two types of CBT:

1. Linear Test: A full-length exam where the com-
puter selects questions independently of individual
performance.

2 Adaptive Test: The computer selects questions based
on a person’s performance level from a large pool of
categorized questions.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for CBT,
following the Waterfall model, involves these steps:

1. Requirements analysis and definition

2. System and software design

3. Implementation and unit testing

4. Integration and system testing

5. Operation and maintenance

CBT is utilized in India for various exams, including those
by IBPS for banking and by the National Testing Agency
(NTA) for exams like UGC, NEET, GPAT, GMA, and more.

Curriculum Framework, Curriculum
and Syllabus .

Until 1976, state governments made decisions about edu-
cation, including the curriculum, with guidance from the
central government.

The National Council for Education Research and
Training (NCERT) developed the National Curriculum
Framework (NCF) in 1975 based on the 1968 Education
Policy recommendations.

In 1976, the constitution was amended to include edu-
cation in the concurrent list, giving both states and the
central government authority.

The 1986 National Policy on Education (NPE) aimed to
modernize education, emphasizing India’s diversity and
setting core values and standards. The NCF was revised in
1988, 2000, and 2005.

In September 2021, the Union Ministry of Education
established a 12-member national steering committee to
create a new National Curriculum Framework (NCF) in
alignment with the National Education Policy 2020 (NEP).

Now, let’s clarify some terms:

1. Curriculum Framework: This is a plan that outlines
what an educational institution must provide to stu-
dents to achieve educational goals for both individu-
als and society.

2. Curriculum: It encompasses all planned activities
designed to facilitate learning and meet educational
objectives, including subject content, teaching meth-
ods, and evaluation.

3. Syllabus: It provides details about subjects, content,
skills, and objectives for a specific course. It also
includes schedules, assessments, assignments, and
projects.

Main DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SYLLABUS AND
CuRRICULUM

1. Syllabus focuses on specific subjects and content
within a course, while curriculum refers to the entire
educational system or course content.

2. Curriculum is broader and prescriptive, whereas syl-
labus is descriptive.

3. Syllabus may vary among teachers, while the curricu-
lum is consistent for all.

4. Syllabus is accessible to students from the beginning,
but curriculum is not provided unless requested.

5. Syllabus creation is mainly the responsibility of teach-
ers, while curriculum development occurs at a higher
level.

6. Syllabus covers one year, while curriculum lasts for
the entire course.

DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO CURRICULUM

1. Subject-Centered Curriculum: Teachers transfer
knowledge to students through lectures and rote
memorization.

2. Behaviorist Curriculum: Learning is viewed as a
change in behavior. It includes competency-based,
criterion-referenced, mastery learning, and pro-
grammed learning.

3. Learner-Centered Curriculum: Motivation and a
stimulating environment are key. Constructivist cur-
riculum emphasizes active learning, social interac-
tions, and accommodating diverse learning styles.

CONSTRUCTIVIST CURRICULUM

This is based on the following points

(a) The knowledge isn’t just given to students. Instead,
they actively create, invent, or discover knowledge.
They don’t just passively receive and store it.

(b) Knowledge is closely tied to how students learn. It is
built upon what they already know and their prior
experiences.

(c) Students need to build and rebuild their understand-
ing. This happens when they encounter new knowl-
edge or reflect on what they’ve learned before.

(d) Interacting with others is crucial for constructing
knowledge. Learning and evolving happen through
social interactions.

(e) Students start with concrete ideas and gradually
move to more abstract ones. Conceptual understand-
ing develops over time.

(f) Each student has a unique learning style. Teachers
should adjust their teaching to accommodate these
differences among students.

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2023 was
released on August 23, 2023 by the Ministry of Education,
Government of India.

The NCF 2023 is a comprehensive document that out-
lines the vision, goals, and objectives of education in India
for the next decade. It is based on the National Education
Policy (NEP) 2020, and it aims to create a new education
system that is aligned with the aspirational goals of 21st
century education, while building upon India’s traditions
and value systems.

The NCF 2023 is based on the five principles of holis-
tic development, equity and inclusion, learning through
doing, critical thinking and problem-solving, and creativ-
ity and innovation. It proposes a number of changes to the
existing education system, including a new curriculum
structure, a focus on foundational literacy and numeracy,
a greater emphasis on experiential learning, and a focus
on 21st century skills.

The NCF 2023 is a landmark document that has the
potential to transform education in India. It is a compre-
hensive and forward-looking framework that is based on

the latest research and best practices in education. The NCF
2023 aims to create an education system that is equitable,
inclusive, and relevant to the needs of the 21st century.

Bi Blended Learning

This model has been adopted by UGC now. The term
‘blended learning’ originated in USA. There is no clear
single definition available for it: Blended learning com-
bines online learning with face-to-face learning. It is also
defined as the combination of multiple approaches to
pedagogy or teaching, for example, self-paced, collabora-
tive and inquiry-based study. It improves research skills,
self-learning, self-engagement, self-driving force, better
decision making and also adds to computer literacy, It
offers a larger sense of responsibility. The overall goal of
blended learning is to provide the most efficient and effec-
tive instruction experience by combining delivery modali-
ties. The different types have been mentioned below.

1. Blended face-to-face class: This is based in the class-
room, although there are many online activities.

2. Blended online class: Sometimes referred to as the
‘online driver model,’ this class is the inverse of the
blended face-to-face class. The class is mostly con-
ducted online, but there are some required in-person
activities such as lectures or labs.

3. The flipped classroom: This reverses the traditional
class structure of listening to a lecture in class and
completing homework activities at home. Students in
flipped classes watch a short lecture video online and
come into the classroom to complete activities such as
group work, projects or other exercises. The flipped
classroom model can be seen as a sub-model of the
blended face-to-face or blended online class.

4, The rotation model: Here, the students in a course
rotate between various modalities, one of which is
online learning. There are various sub-models: sta-
tion rotation, lab rotation and individual rotation.
This requires students in a course to rotate among
locations on campus (at least one of which is an online
learning lab). In the individual rotation model, a stu-
dent rotates through learning modalities on a custom-
ised schedule.

5. The self-blend model: Learners using this model are
enrolled in a school but take online courses in addi-
tion to their traditional face-to-face courses. They are
not directed by a faculty member and choose which
courses they will take online and which they will take
in person.

6. The blended MOOC: This is a form of flipped class-
room using in-person class meetings to supplement a
massive open online course. In 2012, San Jose State
University piloted such a blended MOOC.

.7, Flexible-mode courses: This course offers all instruc-
tion in multiple modes - in person and online and stu-
dents choose how to take their course. An example of
this is San Francisco State University’s hybrid flexible
(HyFlex) model.

and Communication Technology, like computers, the
internet, and mobile phones. This way of learning should
continue even after the pandemic.

ICT-based teaching means using computers, the inter-
net, and devices like mobile phones to help us learn. It
allows us to learn anytime, anywhere. We can use the
internet, email, websites, and even CDs to learn new
things.

ICT-based learning is also called Computer-Based
Training or CBT, but now we call it ICT because of the
internet and new technologies. It includes online learning
and using the web to study.

ICT is important because it makes learning flexibleand
efficient. Learners can go at their own pace. It also lets
us learn together online and from a distance. There are
interactive parts, exercises, animations, and more to help
us learn better. We can even use custom software for spe-
cialized training.

ICT is not just for students; it also helps teachers. They
can learn how to use ICT in teaching and connect with
other teachers worldwide.

Massive Oren Ontine Courses (MOOCs)

Over the past decade, MOOCs gained prominence, attract-
ing diverse learners globally. India ranks second in MOOC
usage, led by private and government initiatives like NPTEL,
IITs, and SWAYAM. These platforms aim to enhance educa-
tion, increase literacy, and refine youth skills. MOOCs fall
into two categories: CMOOCs and xMOOCs.

4, SWAYAM: An Independent Microsoft-Supported
MOOC Program
SWAYAM is a separate MOOC initiative, supported by
Microsoft. It has its own unique features and will be
discussed separately in this unit.

CHALLENGES FoR MOOC in INDIA
Here are some key concerns about using MOOCs in India:

1. Internet Access: Not everyone has fast internet, cre-
ating a digital divide.

2. Funding: We should ease regulations and involve
both public and private sectors.

3. Diverse Nation: India has many cultures and lan-
guages; policies should bridge these gaps.

4. Student Engagement: Teachers and students need
improved communication skills.

5. Quality: We need skilled teachers and technical staff
for high-quality MOOCs.

SWAYAM

SWAYAM is a platform in India that helps people get a
good education using computers. It was started by the
government to make sure everyone can access quality
education, no matter where they are or when they want
to study.

SWAYAM is used from the 9th grade to post-gradua-
tion, and it is taught by the best teachers. You can access it
for free. There are over 1,000 teachers involved.

On SWAYAM, you can learn in four ways:

1, Video lessons: These are like short movies that teach
you a whole course.

2, E-Content: This is like extra material to help you
learn better.

3. Self-assessment: There are quizzes and assignments
to check if you understood what you learned.

4. Discussion forum: You can ask questions if you’re
confused.

SWAYAM has these features:
1, High-quality learning using videos and multimedia.
2. It’s a one-stop place for learning from school to
university.
3. It’s easy to access and get certificates.
4. You can talk to other students and ask questions.
5. It complements what you learn in the classroom.

TEACHING Support SysTEM

Teacher Support System is basically a set of tools that
helps to improve student achievement by building newer
capacities in the teachers. It can be taken as kind of process
as well, it influences the way decisions are made and what
information is passed on. This helps us to know that how
teachers acquire new skills and increase student achieve-
ment in areas they are underperforming. Though they
are happening simultaneously, the movement has taken
place from traditional to modern to ICT (Information and

Research Aptitude


 Introduction of Research

According to the renowned thinker Hudson Maxim, ‘All
progress is born out of inquiry. Our doubts lead to inquir-
ies, and an inquiry leads to an invention.’ It is important to
understand that research is distinct from common sense,
primarily in its procedures and methods. We are discuss-
ing research in a very pragmatic manner so that concep-
tual clarity helps in PhD — Fellowships admissions as well.

We acquire knowledge from various sources, and the
process of knowledge acquisition has become increasingly
rapid. There are five fundamental methods that gradually
evolve into research-oriented approaches:

1. Intuition: This is our initial method of gaining knowl-
edge, where we rely on our gut feelings, emotions,
and instincts.

2. Authority: Accepting new ideas based on the endorse-
ment of authoritative figures.

3. Rationalism: Utilizing logic and reasoning to gain
new insights.

4. Empiricism: Acquiring knowledge through direct
observation and personal experience.

5. Scientific Method: This systematic process involves
collecting and evaluating evidence to test ideas and
answer questions. The purest form of the scientific
method is known as deduction, which will be dis-
cussed later under positivism.

Research is a structured investigation that employs
accepted scientific methodology to solve problems and
generate new universally applicable knowledge. The
objective of research is to comprehend an object, phe-
nomenon, or to address a problem.

The term ‘research’ is comprised of two words, ‘re
and ‘search,’ ‘Re’ denotes repetition or revisiting, while
‘search’ signifies the act of finding out. Research, there-
fore, is a meticulous inquiry and exploration, particularly
to unearth new facts within any field of knowledge.

As defined by Creswell, research is a process involving steps
to collect and analyze information, ultimately enhancing our
understanding of a specific topic or issue. In essence, research:

1. involves a process of inquiry and investigation.
2. is systematic and methodical.
3. expands our knowledge.

Cook offers a comprehensive perspective, defining
research as a sincere, exhaustive, and intelligent search
for facts and their meanings or implications in relation
to a problem. According to him, ‘research’ can be broken
down into the following key components:

P:

?

R = Rational thinking

E = Expert and thorough treatment

S = Search and solution

E = Exactness

A = Analysis

R = Relationship of facts

C = Critical observation, careful planning, construc-
tive attitude, and condensed generalization

\ H = Honesty and hard work

MB chapter 2

The scientific method entails systematic observation,
classification, and interpretation of data. Research is fun-
damentally scientific in nature, emphasizing unbiased
data evaluation. Even in social sciences, there is no room
for unscientific approaches. A successful researcher must
exhibit qualities such as diligence, open-mindedness, and
critical thinking.

Understanding what constitutes a scientific method is
crucial. According to the Random House Dictionary, the
scientific method involves identifying a problem, collect-
ing relevant data, formulating a hypothesis, and empiri-
cally testing it.

Research is akin to embarking on a journey, and it is
imperative to have a clear understanding of its ultimate
destination. While there is no fixed sequence of steps
during this journey, researchers must navigate through a
multitude of methods, approaches, and procedures. The
experience of the researcher plays a pivotal role in guid-
ing actions towards achieving objectives.

Research can be conducted on a multitude of issues,
including:

1. Investigating the emergence and global spread of the
COVID-19 disease.

2. Identifying prevalent health conditions among rural
students.

3. Tracing the evolution of the New Education Policy
since independence.

4. Examining changes in students’ comprehension levels
with varying teaching methods.

The possibilities for research questions are virtually
limitless.

Ii Some Basic Terms in Research

1. Research Paradigms: These refer to overarching
frameworks or worldviews that guide research meth-
odologies and approaches. They include the philo-
sophical assumptions, values, and beliefs that underpin
research in a particular field. Examples are of positiv-
ism, post positivism, constructivism, cognitivism etc.

Here is how research paradigms work:

* Foundational Assumptions: Paradigms are built on
foundational beliefs about the nature of reality and
how we gain knowledge.

* Guidance: They provide direction for research and
practical work in a field.

* Methodology: Paradigms come with specific meth-
ods and tools for data collection and analysis tailored
to their beliefs.

There are three main types of research paragdigms:

* Realism: This paradigm seeks to gather information
from the external world or external sources.

23

research Aptitude

« Constructivism: Here, the focus is on unique individ-
ual experiences, suggesting that nothing important
exists outside of these personal experiences.

Pragmatism: Pragmatism acknowledges that
both realism and constructivism are valid ways
to understand the world, offering two alternative
perspectives,

2, Epistemology: This term was first used by Fredrick
Ferrier. This branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature of knowledge, how knowledge is acquired, and
what constitutes knowledge. It explores questions
about the sources, limits, and validity of knowledge.

Rationalism and Empiricism are two ways of looking
at how do we gain knowledge:

(a) Rationalism: This believes in the power of logic
and reason. René Descartes, argue that some
knowledge is innate and derived from reason.
Rationalism places the mind above the senses,
using logic and reason before actual experience
to draw conclusions. Think of it as ‘thinking
before experiencing.’ Rationalism is closely tied
to deduction, where you start with general prin-
ciples and derive specific conclusions from them.

(b) Empiricism: John Locke, argues that knowledge
comes primarily from sensory experience which
are the foundation of knowledge. It argues that
all knowledge comes from our senses, and with-
out these sensory experiences, we wouldn’t have
any knowledge at all. This approach is known as
‘learning from experience’ or ‘seeing is believing.’
Empiricism is associated with induction, where
you draw general conclusions based on specific
observations.

3. Metaphysics: Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy
that explores fundamental questions about the nature
of reality, existence, and the relationship between the
mind and the external world.Metaphysics deals with
abstract concepts such as time, space, causation, and
existence.

4. Ontology: Ontology is a subfield of metaphysics that
specifically deals with the study of being and exis-
tence.Ontology seeks to answer questions about what
entities or categories of things exist in the world and
what their fundamental nature is.

Metaphysics and Ontology closely _ related.
Metaphysics is concerned with the broad questions
about the nature of reality, while ontology is con-
cerned with the specific questions about what exists
and what the fundamental nature of things is.

5. Axiology: Axiology is the branch of philosophy that
deals with values, ethics, and aesthetics. It explores
questions about what is morally right or wrong, what
is beautiful or ugly, and what constitutes good or bad.
For example, here, we study about utilitarianism that
maximizes our overall happiness.

Figure 2.1 Research Methodology Approaches

6. Theory: A theory is a systematic and coherent set
of principles or ideas used to explain phenomena or
make predictions. Theories provide frameworks for
understanding the world and guide research and
inquiry. For example, in psychology, Sigmund Freud’s
psychoanalytic theory says that human behaviour is
influenced by unconscious drives and conflicts.
Research methodology emerges as a result of combin-
ing epistemology, ontology and axiology. As we dis-
cuss, research methodology is the process of design-
ing and conducting research. It is concerned with the
questions of how to generate knowledge, how to test
hypotheses, and how to interpret findings.

§§ Positivism and Post- Positivism
First, we need to have a historical perspective on the research:

1. Research has roots in ancient civilizations such as
the Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese. In ancient Bharat,
research took place in Mathematics (courtesy Ary-
abhatta, Brahmagupta, Bhaskara II), Astronomy,
Astrology, Philosophy, Yoga, Meditation etc. The book
Charak Samhita (traditional Indian medicine sys-
tem) might have been written as a result of empirical
observation and experimentation.

2. During Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Leonardo
da Vinci and Galileo Galilei emphasized ‘systematic
observation’ and ‘experimentation’, setting the stage
for the development of modern scientific methods.

3. During Enlightenment era of the 17th and 18th cen-
turies Francis Bacon and John Locke championed
empiricism and reason.

Positivism

Positivism had origins in the natural sciences but was
extended to the social sciences, such as sociology, eco-
nomics, psychology etc. French philosopher Auguste
Comte (1798 — 1857) is supposed to be the first person
apply positivist principles in a systematic manner to the
study of society. That way, he challenged the view that
society was governed by divine or supernatural forces. His

work paved a way for the theories on social development
and social change. Other sociologists used empirical data
and scientific methods for the better understanding and
solving social problems.

Key features of positivism include:

1. Emphasis on Science: Positivists apply scientific
observation and experimentation in social sciences as
was being done in the case of natural sciences. This
started using hypotheses, sampling, measurements,
analysis, and drawing conclusions. All these were
being guided by empiricism, objectivity, and value
neutrality. In order to be scientific, we must first be
‘systematic.’

2. Objectivity: Positivists hold that the world can be
studied objectively, free from personal biases or val-
ues. Researchers act as objective data collectors and
interpreters, minimizing interaction with partici-
pants, and emphasizing quantifiable observations.

3. Empiricism: Positivists stress the importance of
basing knowledge on empirical evidence, which
means collecting data through observation and
experimentation.

4. Reductionism: Positivists believe that complex phe-
nomena can be broken down into their simplest com-
ponents, allowing for their study using the scientific
method. The data is quantifiable.

Overall, positivism’s ontology is realist, and its epistemol-

ogy is objectivist, emphasizing factual knowledge through
observation. The deductive approach is preferable, with
less scope for alternative methods.

PoOST-POSITIVISM

The focus was on the objectivity and its use of quantitative
methods in positivism, that was gradually acknowledged
as the limitation of positivism.

To counter this limitation, post positivism emerged as
an alternative or main approach. With time, researchers
could acknowledge the role of subjectivity, context, and
interpretation in research, especially in the social sci-
ences. That approach, they often use qualitative research
methods, critical theory, and a more nuanced under-
standing of the social world in their work.

Here are some key features of post-positivism:

* Recognition of subjectivity: Post-positivists recog-
nize that researchers are always subjective and that
their own experiences and biases can influence their
research. They strive to be transparent about their
biases and to take steps to minimize their impact on
their research.

* Emphasis on context: They believe that it is impor-
tant to understand the context in which research is
conducted. They argue that the social world is com-
plex and that findings from one context may not be
generalizable to other contexts.

* Use of qualitative methods: They often use quali-
tative research methods, such as interviews, focus
groups, and ethnography, to collect data. These

methods allow researchers to learn about the expe-
riences and perspectives of individuals and groups i
depth. f

* Use of critical theory: They often use critical theory
to examine the social world and to identify power
imbalances and injustices. They believe that research
should be used to promote social change.

Post-positivism is a valuable approach to research because
it allows researchers to explore complex social phenom-
ena in a way that is both rigorous and nuanced. It is a
particularly good approach for research that focuses on
the experiences of individuals and groups that are often
marginalized or overlooked.

Difference of ‘Reality’ and ‘Critical Reality’: Positivism
is a single ‘reality’ that exists independently of human
minds. Positivism is a philosophical perspective that holds
that knowledge, particularly in the realm of natural sci-
ences, should be based on observable facts and empirical
evidence.

Post-positivism promotes reflection and critical think-
ing (multiple perspectives) regarding the procedures,
presumptions, and theories applied in scientific study. It
accepts that scientific knowledge is always being updated
and that no hypothesis can provide proof beyond a rea-
sonable doubt. Post-positivism provides for a more com-
plex and context-dependent interpretation of reality as
opposed to asserting a single, objective reality.

Mixed Research: Positivism and post-positivism can be
applied simultaneously in a research project, and this is
often referred to as a mixed-methods research approach.
For example, there is a research question - to understand
the impact of a new educational intervention program
on student performance. Under positivism, there will be
quantitative survey and data analysis. Under post positiv-
ism, there may be ‘qualitative interviews’ to know about
the diversified personal experiences and ‘thematic analy-
sis’ for identifying common themes, patterns, and narra-
tives. We need to understand that there is dominance of
post positivism over positivism these days.

ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF RESEARCH

Research involves several key characteristics that are cru-
cial for producing reliable and credible results.

1. Objectivity: Objectivity in research refers to the qual-
ity of conducting research without personal bias,
prejudices, or subjective influences. It involves main-
taining a neutral and impartial approach throughout
the research process. The goal is to ensure that the
research results accurately reflect the data and are
not distorted by the researcher’s personal beliefs or
opinions, Objectivity enhances the credibility (trust
and acceptance), reliability (consistency of research)
and generalizability (making findings applicable to
larger population or broader context) of the research
which have been discussed separately.

25

research Aptitude

Main Techniques to Ensure Objectivity:

¢ Procedural Safeguards: That means keeping
complete records of observations and data anal-
ysis in a form that other researchers can under-
stand and evaluate.

e Standardization: Standardization involves using
uniform and consistent procedures in all phases
of data collection. This reduces the chances of
introducing biases due to variations in research
methods.

* Clearer Operationalization Definitions of
Concepts: This means defining howa concept will
be measured or what specific operations will be
used to produce it. Clarity in definitions reduces
ambiguity and subjectivity.

¢ Avoiding Bias: The safety from external influ-
ences, personal beliefs, observer perspectives,
and human expectations is crucial for this. A
researcher can implement ‘blinding techniques’,
ensuring that both researchers and participants
are unaware of certain aspects of the study.

e¢ Peer Review: This helps to identify and mitigate
potential biases. External reviewers can provide
valuable feedback to ensure objectivity.

¢ Data Validation: This needs checks and valida-
tion procedures on data collection and analysis
can help ensure objectivity.

¢ Triangulation: Researchers use triangulation by
employing multiple methods or data sources to
confirm findings. This approach minimizes the
influence of bias from a single source or method.

2. Reliability: Reliability refers to the consistency of
research results. In simple terms, it means that if the
same research is conducted multiple times under
similar conditions, it should yield similar results.
For example, if a study on the effects of TV-watching
on children’s class performance consistently shows
that watching TV leads to lower grades, it is con-
sidered reliable. The more similar the results across
repetitions, the higher is the reliability. Reliability is
assessed through various criteria:

¢ Stability: Stability simply means that if the same
measure or test is administered to the same indi-
viduals on multiple occasions, the results should
be consistent or similar. The mention of ‘test-
retest correlation’ clarifies how researchers assess
this stability.

¢ Equivalence: This aspect of reliability concerns
whether the same measure or test, when admin-
istered by different investigators or researchers,
produces similar or consistent results or not. This
ensures that the measurement is not influenced
by the individual administering it and contributes
to the overall reliability of the research.

* Homogeneity: Homogeneity assesses whether
different operational definitions of the same con-
cept, like poverty or job satisfaction, applied to the

same individuals using the same data-collection
method, result in highly correlated outcomes.

¢ Half-split method or split-half method: This
is again meant to assess the internal consistency
or reliability of a measurement instrument, such
as a questionnaire or a test. Here, the items or
questions in the instrument are divided into two
equivalent halves. Then comparing the responses
of participants to each half are compared with
each other. The correlation between the two sets
of questions is measured.

Reliability in research involves assessing how consis-

tent and dependable measurements are. There are

four main ways to estimate reliability:

¢ Inter-Rater Reliability: This checks if different
raters or observers give consistent assessments of
the same thing. For example, if multiple teachers
are grading students’ essays, inter-rater reliability
assesses whether they assign similar scores.

¢ Test-Retest Reliability: This evaluates how con-
sistent a measurement is over time. If you use a
test to measure someone’s math skills today and
then again in a month, test-retest reliability tells
you if the scores remain stable.

* Parallel-Forms Reliability: This checks the con-
sistency between results of two tests created in
the same way, covering the same content. For
instance, if you have two different versions of a
reading comprehension test, parallel-forms reli-
ability assesses if they yield similar scores.

¢ Internal Consistency Reliability: This measures
the consistency of results across different items
within a single test or questionnaire. It ensures
that the questions within a survey, for example,
all measure the same underlying construct, like
job satisfaction.

Few errors in measurement are as follows:

¢ Random Error: This stems from unpredictable
external factors that affect some measurements
but not others. It’s like background noise and is
often disregarded because it can’t be controlled.
¢ Systematic Error: This arises from factors that
consistently influence all measurements in a sam-
ple. It introduces bias and should be corrected to
improve the accuracy of the sample’s results. For
example, if a scale used to measure weight con-
sistently reads 2 pounds too heavy for everyone,
that’s a systematic error that needs adjustment.
3. Validity: In research, validity often takes precedence
over reliability. While both are important, validity
ensures that the concepts are defined accurately, min-
imizing measurement errors.

Validity is more important than reliability because
it is possible for a measure to be reliable but not
valid. For example, a test may be very consistent in its
results, but it may not actually be measuring what it is
intended to measure.

2.6

Types of Validity:

There are different types of validity in research:

e Internal Validity: For example, in a controlled
experiment, if we want to establish whether a
new drug causes a reduction in blood pressure,
internal validity ensures that the observed reduc-
tion is indeed due to the drug and not influenced
by other variables like diet or exercise.

° External Validity: Suppose a study conducted
in a laboratory finds that a particular teaching
method improves student performance.

To assess external validity, we’d consider whether
these findings can be generalized.

° Face Validity: Imagine we design a questionnaire
to measure job satisfaction, and employees agree
that the questions seem relevant to assessing their
job satisfaction. This indicates that the question-
naire has face validity.

* Content Validity: If we create an aptitude test
for Mathematics that includes questions covering
a broad range of mathematical topics, it demon-
strates content validity because it assesses the full
spectrum of math skills.

¢ Criterion Validity: Consider a scenario where
a university uses the results of a standardized
admission test to predict students’ academic suc-
cess during their first year. If the test indeed pre-
dicts student performance accurately, it exhibits
criterion validity.

* Predictive Validity: If the test accurately predicts
students’ actual first-year academic performance.

* Concurrent Validity: Suppose we introduce a
new test alongside an existing one and find that
the two tests yield similar results. This demon-
strates concurrent validity.

°  Postdictive Validity: If a psychological test can
reliably measure an individual’s past experiences,
it shows postdictive validity.

* Construct Validity: Here, we develop a personal-
ity assessment that accurately measures traits like
extraversion, introversion, and openness to expe-
riences, and these traits align with established
personality theory. This demonstrates construct
validity.

. Generalizability: Generalizability pertains to the

extent to which research findings can be applied to a
larger population. If a study is based on a represen-
tative sample, its findings are more likely to apply to
the entire population. Generalization is more facili-
tated through null hypothesis, Random Sampling,
Random Assignment, Multisite Studies, Well-
Defined Populations, Randomized Controlled Trials
(RCTs), Stratified Sampling, Replication, Theoretical
Framework, systematic research design.

RCTs is linked with random assignment, controlled
experimental conditions, which result in cause-and-
effect relationships.

5. Accuracy: Accuracy relates to the precision and
correctness of research processes, tools, and pro-
cedures. Rigorous scientific methods ensure accu-
racy in research. Choosing the right data collection
tools enhances research accuracy.Accuracy refers
to the closeness of a measurement or finding to the
true value. Accuracy is a necessary condition for
validity.

In order to be valid, a study must be both accurate
and relevant to the research question being asked.

6. Credibility: Credibility involves using the best
sources and procedures in research. Proper references
and reliable data sources enhance research credibil-
ity. Fake references can reduce credibility.

7. Cyclical: Research may be cyclical, starting with a
problem and often leading to new research questions.
A problem identified in one study can become the
basis for further research.

8. Replicable: Research should be replicable, mean-
ing that others can repeat the study to verify the
results. Replicability builds a solid foundation for
decision-making.

lls Types of Research

Researchers should be flexible when classifying
approaches. To be on practical side, research approaches
aren't always rigidly defined. Research often involves
a mix of methods. For instance, positivism is associated
with experimental, quantitative, and deductive research,
while post-positivism leans towards descriptive, qualita-
tive, and inductive approaches. However, many studies
blend these methods.

DESCRIPTIVE RESEARCH

This research method is used to describe and provide an
accurate representation of a phenomenon or a group of
phenomena. It aims to answer questions about the ‘what,’
‘who,’ ‘where,’ and ‘how’ of a particular topic without nec-
essarily delving into the ‘why’ or causality. This method
is primarily concerned with documenting and portraying
the characteristics, behaviours, and attributes of the sub-
ject being studied.

Main Features of Descriptive Research

1. Objective Description: This seeks to objectively
describe and document a phenomenon, group, or sit-
uation. It does not attempt to manipulate variables or
establish causal relationships.
Naturalistic Setting: Researchers frequently watch
and gather data in natural settings in order to guar-
antee that the subject’s behaviours or traits are as
authentic as possible. Overall, no manipulation nor
control are possible.
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Data: Descriptive
research can involve the collection of both quantitative
data (numbers and measurements) and qualitative

RS

data (descriptive and non-numerical information).
4. Cross-Sectional: Descriptive research typically
focuses on a single point in time or a specific period. It

provides a snapshot of the subject at that moment.

5. Large Sample Sizes: To ensure the accuracy and gen-
eralizability of findings, descriptive studies often use
large and representative samples.

Applications of Descriptive Research

Descriptive research is valuable for providing a founda-
tional understanding of a topic, generating hypotheses,

27

and guiding further research. It is often a starting point
for more in-depth investigations that explore causation
and underlying mechanisms. Descriptive research serves
several purposes:

1. Understanding Behaviour and Traits: It helps in
comprehending the behaviours, characteristics, and
patterns of participants.

2. Opinions and Attitudes: Through closed-ended
questions, it uncovers participants’ opinions and atti-
tudes, aiding decision-making.

3. Trend Measurement: It is useful for tracking trends
over time.

4. Comparisons: Descriptive research enables compari-
sons, highlighting differences and similarities among
variables.

5. Data Analysis: Analysis of the collected data is an
integral part of this research.

Descriptive research can take two forms:

1. Cross-sectional Study: Involves one-time data col-
lection or interaction.

2. Longitudinal Study: Collects data multiple times from
the same individuals to observe changes over time.

Types of Descriptive Research

1. Observational Research: Researchers directly
observe and record behaviours, actions, or events in
their natural settings. This can be done with or with-
out the subject’s awareness.

Examples:

1. A psychologist observes children’s behaviour in a
playground to understand how they interact and
play with one another.

2. Researchers observe shoppers in a grocery store
to analyze their purchasing habits and product
preferences without the shoppers knowing they
are being observed.

2. Survey Research: Surveys involve collecting data
from a sample of individuals through question-
naires, interviews, or online forms. Surveys are used
to gather information about attitudes, preferences,
opinions, and demographics.

Examples:

1. A political scientist conducts a survey with a ran-
dom sample of voters to collect data on their polit-
ical affiliations and preferences.

2. A marketing company sends out an online ques-
tionnaire to gather information about consumer
attitudes towards a new product.

3. Case Studies: Case studies involve an in-depth analy-
sis of a single individual, group, or entity. Researchers
collect data from multiple sources, such as interviews,
documents, and observations, to provide a compre-
hensive understanding of the subject.

Examples:

1. Apsychologist closely studies a person with a rare
psychological disorder, using interviews, records,
and tests to learn more about the condition.

ME Chapter 2 |

2. A business analyst looks at a growing (or declin-
ing) startup, checking its history, strategies, and
leaders to figure out why it’s successful (or failure).

4. Content Analysis: This examines and quantifies
the content of written, verbal, or visual materials.

Researchersanalyze texts, media content, or histori-

cal records to identify patterns and trends.

Examples:

1. Researchers study news articles to find patterns
in how a political topic was covered in the media
over ten years.

2. Scholars analyze social media posts to see how
gender is portrayed in online conversations.

5. Causal Comparative Research: This type of descrip-
tive research involves comparing two or more groups
or entities to identify similarities and differences. For
example, a study comparing the eating habits of peo-
ple in different regions.

1. An anthropologist looks at how two indigenous
tribes from different areas do things to see what’s
the same and what’s different in their cultures.

2. Economists check how fast different countries are
growing economically at the same time to figure
out what’s making them develop differently.

Types of Causal Comparative Research
Causal comparative research comes in two forms:

* Retrospective Causal Comparative Research:
In this type, researchers look back in time to
examine effects that have already happened.
They then investigate the causes. This is the more
common approach.

¢ Prospective Causal Comparative Research:
Here, researchers start with causes and study
their expected effects in the future.

6. Correlational Research: While it can have elements
of causation, correlational research primarily focuses
on describing the relationships between variables. It
quantifies the degree and direction of associations
between variables.

Examples:

1. Asociologist studies if people with more money also
tend to have more education in a big group of people.

2. Researchers check if working out more is con-
nected to weighing less in a group of people to see
if exercise affects weight.

OTHER Types OF Descriptive RESEARCH
1. Ex Post Facto Research

* Used in Social Sciences and Business: This
research is common in fields like social sciences
and business organizations.

° Studying After the Fact: It’s all about studying
a phenomenon after it has happened or while it’s
happening. ;

¢ Non-manipulated Variables: Ex post facto
research deals with variables that can’t be

manipulated. For example, if you want to under-
stand the impact of air pollution on health, you
can’t intentionally expose people to pollution, so
you study those who were already exposed.
Example: Research on the academic perfor-
mance of students after a new teaching method is
implemented.

2. Historical Research

* Similar to Ex Post Facto: Historical research is
similar to ex post facto research and is a dimen-
sion of descriptive research.

* Focus on History: It primarily focuses on the his-
torical aspects of a particular issue or problem.
Example: Studying the growth of trade unions in
India or the evolution of the modern education
system in India.

3. Analytical Research

¢ Using Existing Information: Analytical research
relies on existing facts and information.

* Critical Evaluation: Its goal is to critically evalu-
ate this material to gain deeper insights.
Example: Analyzing existing financial data to
determine the factors affecting a company’s
profitability.

4. Exploratory Research

¢ Initial Exploration: Exploratory research is typi-
cally conducted at the beginning of a study to
explore an area with limited prior knowledge.

* Understanding Relationships: It seeks to
understand why and how certain relationships
exist between different aspects of a situation or
phenomenon.

* Purpose: The purpose of exploratory research is
to gather background information, define terms,
clarify problems, develop hypotheses, establish
research priorities, and generate questions for
further investigation.

¢ Data Sources: It uses various data sources,
including literature reviews, experience surveys,
case studies, interviews (especially focus group
interviews), projective techniques, and Delphi
techniques.

Example: Conducting preliminary surveys and
interviews to explore public perceptions of a new
product before launching it.

is Experimental Research

Experimental research is a scientific method used to
investigate cause-and-effect relationships between vari-
ables by manipulating one or more independent variables
and observing their effects on one or more dependent var-
iables. It is characterized by a controlled and systematic
approach to studying phenomena, allowing researchers
to draw conclusions about causality.

research Aptitude

(Main FEATURES OF EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH

4. Manipulation of Variables: Experimental research
involves intentionally changing or manipulating one or
more independent variables, which are factors or condi-
tions believed to influence the outcome of interest. The
independent variable is what the researcher controls.

2. Controlled Environment: Experiments are con-
ducted in a controlled setting to minimize the influ-
ence of extraneous variables (factors other than the
independent variable) on the results. This control
allows researchers to isolate the effects of the inde-
pendent variable.

3. Randomization: Participants are often randomly
assigned to different groups, such as an experimental

2.9

group and a control group. Randomization helps
ensure that the groups are comparable, and any dif-
ferences observed can be attributed to the manipu-
lation of the independent variable rather than pre-
existing group differences.

- Replication: To establish the reliability and valid-

ity of findings, experimental studies should be rep-
licable. This means that other researchers should
be able to conduct the same experiment and obtain
similar results.

- Quantitative Data: Experimental research typically

generates quantitative data, which can be analyzed
statistically to determine the strength and signifi-
cance of relationships between variables,

Pre-experiments are research methods used for comparison. They are not as structured as typical experiments and are
mainly used for exploration and comparison with other experimental designs. They act as a sort of control group for

making comparisons.

Types of Pre-Experiments

1. One-Shot Case Study Research Design:

* In this type of research, we focus on one thing we
want to study (dependent variable).

* It’s like a test done after something has happened,
so we call it a ‘post-test.’

° It’s challenging to determine cause and effect

because we don’t have a clear before-and-after

picture.

For example, in schools, exams are given at

the end of a semester to evaluate students.

Students (dependent) are compared to lectures

(independent).

2.

One-Group Pre - test-Post - test Design:
¢ This design is a bit more structured.

° It tests one group both before and after something
(the treatment) is done.

¢ However, it doesn’t provide strong evidence
because it lacks control.

¢ Also, it’s not great for making general conclusions.

. Static-Group Comparison:

* This is the most practical aspect of the three.
* It involves studying two groups: one gets the
treatment, and the other doesn’t.

¢ After testing both groups, we compare the
differences.



=== Page 35 ===
2.10

° It’s practical but doesn’t meet all the criteria for a
true experiment.
In essence, pre-experimental designs are less rigorous
than typical experiments and are often used for initial
exploration and comparisons. They have limitations in
establishing cause and effect but serve as useful starting
points for research.

True Experiments

True experiments are like the ‘gold standard’ in research.

They help us understand cause-and-effect relationships

between variables by carefully manipulating, controlling,

and randomly assigning groups.

Characteristics of True Experiments

1. Focused on One Population: True experiments focus
on studying one specific group of people or things.

2. Three Key Aspects: They take care of three important
things: Manipulation (changing something), Control
(making sure everything's fair), and random assign-
ment (randomly putting people in groups).

3. Control Group: In true experiments, there is a con-
trol group that doesn’t get the experimental treat-
ment. This helps us compare and see the impact of the
treatment.

Types of True Experiments

1. The Pretest Post Test Design:

* This type relies on statistical analysis to confirm
or reject a hypothesis.

* It involves at least two variables assigned
randomly.

¢ There are three sub-types.

2. The Post - test-Only Control Group Design:

* Here, subjects are randomly assigned to two
groups: one gets the treatment, and one doesn’t.

* Both groups are observed and tested after the
treatment to see the differences.

* For example, to evaluate teaching methods, two
groups of students are taught by different teach-
ers, and their posttest scores are compared.

3. The Pretest-Post - test Control Group Design:

° Two groups are randomly assigned subjects.

* Both groups are tested before and after the treat-
ment to measure changes.

¢ For instance, this method can be used to evaluate
employees’ skills. Candidates are tested before
and after training to see how much they improved.

4. Solomon Four-Group Design:

* This design combines elements of the previous
two methods.

* Subjects are randomly assigned to four groups,
and two groups use each of the previous methods.

In a true experimental research design, you change
something (manipulate), have a control group, and
randomly assign subjects. This helps you draw conclu-
sions about cause and effect after exposing subjects to a
treatment

Quasi-Experiments

Quasi-experiments are a bit like experiments, but they
come with some differences. They allow researchers to
work with real-world situations where it’s not always easy
to do true experiments. Here’s how they work:

Similar to Experiments

* ‘Quasi’ means they resemble experiments.

* You can still change something (independent vari-
able) before seeing what happens (dependent
variable).

Key Characteristics

* Quasi-experiments have a sense of directionality,
meaning researchers have an idea of where they are
going.

* Participants aren’t randomly assigned, so other fac-
tors can affect who’s in the study.

* They are used for convenience, especially when deal-
ing with small sample sizes that make randomization
tough.

Advantages of Quasi-Experiments

* They fit better with real-world situations and are eas-
ier to set up than true experiments, which need ran-
dom assignment.

* They are practical and doable.

How Quasi-Experiments Work

° In a quasi-experiment, the researcher decides who
goes where, unlike a natural experiment where it hap-
pens ‘naturally.’

* But, there can still be issues with the results, like
doubts about whether the cause-and-effect link is
real.

Types of Quasi-Experimental Designs

1. Time-Series Design:

° Here, you measure something (dependent vari-
able) at different times before and after you apply
a treatment.

* It’s like tracking how people’s scores change over
time after a new teaching method is introduced.

2. Multiple Time Series:

* This design adds a control group for comparison.

* So, you're not just looking at changes over time,
but you’re also comparing two groups to see if the
treatment made a difference.

Quasi-experimental research designs help researchers
deal with real-life situations and limited resources. While

Research Aptitude

they are not as strict as true experiments, they still give
yaluable insights into cause and effect, although with
some limitations.

Statistical Groups

Statistical groups deal with randomness, making research
flexible when dealing with many factors. This random-
ness comes from how we assign people to groups.
Advantages of Randomized Designs: Randomized
designs help researchers tackle complex real-world situ-
ations. They come from randomly putting people into
treatment groups.

Types of Statistical Group Designs

1. Randomized Block Design
¢ We group research subjects into blocks.
¢ Then, we randomly give each block a treatment.
¢ If each treatment shows up at least once in each
block, it is called a ‘completely randomized block
design.’
2. Latin Square Design
¢ This design arranges treatments in a grid.
¢ Each treatment appears exactly once in each row
and column.
3. Factorial Design
° It’s a way to study different treatments efficiently.

¢ Researchers combine multiple studies into one to
examine treatment variations.
Statistical group designs help researchers handle ran-
domness and complexity in research, ensuring good data
even in unpredictable situations.

CLASSIFICATION ON THE Basis OF APPLICATION

On the basis of application, research is of two types,
namely pure (or basic research) and applied research.

CLASSIFICATION ON THE Basis oF Loaic

In research, conclusions are based on two approaches,
deduction and induction.



=== Page 36 ===
2.12

Chapter 2

Deductive Approach

It is also termed as top-down or general-to-specific
approach.

In deduction, we start from a theory and try to prove
it with the help of available information. The deductive
method involves the following three steps.

1. State the hypothesis (based on theory or research
literature).

2. Collect data to test the hypothesis.
3. Make decision to accept or reject the hypothesis.

Examples

1. All men are mortal (general fact, applies to all men).
2. Socrates is a man.

3. (Therefore,) Socrates is mortal (specific).

Inductive Approach
It is also termed as bottom-up approach.

In inductive research, we move from specific to general.
This approach also involves the following three steps:

1. Observe different phenomena in the world.

2. Search for a pattern in what is observed.
3. Make a generalization about what is occurring.

Examples

1. Socrates is mortal (specific).

2. Alexander is mortal (specific), Pluto is mortal and so
on (specific).

3. All men are mortal (general).

Take another example: 3 + 5 =8. Here, eight is an even num-
ber. 7 + 59 = 66, and the result is again an even number,
Therefore, the conclusion is when an odd number is added
to another odd number, the result will be an even number.

Figure 2.3 shows the main components that form a
part of inductive and deductive approach.

CLASSIFICATION ON THE Basis oF InouIRY MopeE

Basically, the process adopted to find answers to research

questions involves two approaches, structured and
unstructured.

Structured Approach

1. The structured approach to inquiry is usually classified
as quantitative research.

2. Everything that forms the research process, such as
objectives, design, sample, and the questions that a
researcher plans to ask of respondents, is predetermined.

3. It is more appropriate to determine the extent of a prob-
lem, issue, or phenomenon by quantifying the variation.
For example, how many people have a particular prob-
lem? How many people hold a particular attitude?

Unstructured Approach

1. The unstructured approach to inquiry is usually clas-
sified as qualitative research.

2. It allows flexibility in all aspects of the research
process.

3. It is more appropriate to explore the nature of a prob-
lem, issue, or phenomenon without quantifying it.

CLASSIFICATION ON THE Basis OF Process

1. Quantitative Research

° Deductive and Numbers: Quantitative research
is like a detective; it uses a deductive approach
and focuses on numbers and statistics.

* Systematic Measurement: It systematically mea-
sures variables and rigorously tests hypotheses.

2. Qualitative Research

* Words and Meanings: Qualitative research is
more about words and meanings, like digging
deep into the story.They explore various aspects
of human experiences, cultures, and texts to gain
deeper insights and understanding.

* Exploring Concepts: Qualitative methods let
researchers explore concepts and experiences in
a thorough and comprehensive way.

Qualitative Research Types

We first discuss with the two main historical approaches
and then with the regular research types:

Interpretive Paradigm: In fields like sociology and
political science, the interpretive approach in research
emphasizes flexibility, valid methods, and collecting rich
detailed data. This data comes from insiders and is based
on what researchers see and hear.

Verstehen: Max Weber, a German sociologist, introduced
this concept in anthropology and sociology, Verstehen
means trying to deeply understand and relate to another
culture or perspective. It’s about gaining a meaningful
understanding by seeing things from their point of view
like putting yourself in their shoes. ,

Other Important Qualitative Research Types
1. In-Depth Interview

° One-on-one interviews with participants.

* Questions are planned but can be flexible.

* Usually lasts 20-30 minutes to get information.
2. Focus Group

° There are 6-10 participants, there is diverse par-
ticipant selection.

research Aptitude

e There is interactive Environment and thus action-
able insights.

¢ Thedatais qualitative, with Open-Ended questions.
The communication can be non-verbal as well.

* There may be cross-cultural and ethical
considerations.

° Moderator skills are required, there is possibility
of being it an iterative process.

¢ Purposive or snowball sampling to select partici-
pants in focus group.

¢ Overall study is time-consuming. There is scope
for ‘data saturation’ as all aspects of a study are
discussed, nothing is left to chance.

3. Narrative Research

* This research approach focuses on the collection
and analysis of stories or narratives shared by
individuals.

° Researchers aim to understand how people con-
struct meaning through storytelling and how these
narratives shape their experiences and identities.

* There is interpretive analysis and contextual
understanding.

4. Phenomenology

¢ Phenomenology is a philosophical and research
approach that focuses on exploring and under-
standing the ‘lived experiences’ of individuals and
how they make sense of the world around them.

¢ Researchers set aside their expectations (‘brack-
eting’) and explore unknown areas.

5. Ethnography
¢ It focus on the study of cultural groups.
* Researchers live with and become part of the cul-
ture, exploring rituals and customs.
¢ Involves interviews and participant observation.

6. Semiotics

* Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols in
various forms of communication, including mass
media.

* These signs and symbols often carry cultural
weight and can have different meanings in vari-
ous cultural contexts.

* This decodes hidden meanings and examines
how meaning is created within a culture.

7. Discourse analysis

* This is a research method used to study language
and communication in various forms, including
spoken or written texts, conversations, speeches,
interviews, and more.

e This aims to uncover and understand how lan-
guage is used to construct meaning, convey
power dynamics, and shape social and cultural
phenomena.

* Discourse analysis is often used in research on
social issues, such as racism, sexism, and classism.

10.

11.

12.

2.13

It can also be used in research on topics such as
education, healthcare, and politics.

Transformative/Emancipatory Paradigm

* Focuses on how reality is shaped by culture, poli-
tics, economics, and other factors.

¢ This research type emphasizes the importance of
values and aims for critical praxis (action).

. Case Study Research: This is a research approach

that involves an in-depth and comprehensive investi-
gation of a specific subject or case.

¢ The case study be quantitative or qualitative,
depending on the purpose.

¢ This involves deep exploration and data collec-
tion, not hypothesis testing.

* This is used in various fields like management,
education, and psychology.

* This is a holistic perspective, there are multiple
angles and consider various contributing factors
on a particular case or phenomena

Content Analysis

* Data collection: Content analysis begins with the
collection of data, which can take various forms,
including written texts, audio recordings, videos,
images, or any other form of communication or
media.

° Coding: The researchers read, listen to, or view
the data and systematically identify specific ele-
ments, themes, or categories within it. These ele-
ments can be words, phrases, sentences, visual
symbols, or other relevant units.

* Coding Scheme and Coding of Data: They are
also deveoped with help from data acollection
and coding.

* Thereafter analysis and interpretation are done
and conclusions are drawn. Context is considered
to draw meaningful inferences.

Grounded Theory: - This is a data driven qualitative
research approach that develops theory from data col-
lected through interviews and participant observation.
The data is analysed to identify patterns and themes,
which are then used to develop a theory that explains
the social process or phenomenon being studied.

For example, a researcher is interested in studying the
experiences of people who have been diagnosed with
cancer. The researcher begins by interviewing people
who have cancer. The researcher also conducts par-
ticipant observation in cancer support groups. After
that themes are developed such as social support, psy-
chology of fear of death etc.

Hermeneutics: This is a philosophical and method-
ological tradition that focuses on the interpretation of
texts, including philosophical and biblical texts. It is
concerned with the meaning of texts and how we can
understand them.

Classification Based on Concept

Conceptual Research: Conceptual research primarily
serves philosophers and intellectuals, aiming to either
create novel concepts or offer fresh interpretations of
existing ones. This type of research delves into abstract
ideas and theories.

Empirical Research: Empirical research relies solely
on direct experience or observation, often without strict
adherence to established systems and theories. It relies on
data, generating conclusions that can be verified through
observation or experimentation.

In empirical research, researchers typically formulate
working hypotheses, collect data to either confirm or
refute these hypotheses, and maintain control over the
collected facts. This approach is particularly useful when
seeking evidence that certain variables influence others
in various ways.

Action research encompasses various research methods.
Its goal is to identify and solve problems efficiently.
It’s essentially ‘learning by doing.’

Oricin AND DEFINITION

Coined by Kurt Lewin in the 1940s.

Lewin described it as a spiral of planning, action, and
fact-finding.

Cohen and Manion (1989) saw it as small-scale inter-
vention in the real world.

Research as a Process.

The research process is typically guided by three funda-
mental criteria:

1. Methodological Framework: Research can take on
various approaches, such as qualitative or quantita-
tive, depending on the academic discipline and the
nature of the inquiry.

2. Research Methodology: This encompasses the sys-
tematic sequencing of steps employed to address
research questions. This incorporates procedures,
methods, and techniques that undergo testing for
their validity and reliability.

3. Unbiased Objectivity: Research endeavours to
maintain impartiality and objectivity throughout the
investigation.

According to Creswell’s definition, research involves
three fundamental steps:

1. Problem Formulation: This initial step involves

crafting a research question or identifying a problem
that the researcher aims to address.

. Data Collection: Research proceeds by gathering

data to provide answers to the identified questions or
problems.

. Findings Presentation: The research concludes with

the presentation of answers or findings in response to
the initial question or problem.

Research Aptitude

Step 1: Formulation of Research
Problem

At the beginning of our research journey, we start the pro-
cess with an attempt understand the context. We gather
insights from our observations, beliefs, existing infor-
mation, and general knowledge. This process guides us
toward fresh perspectives and novel ideas about a particu-
lar phenomenon.

While we don’t need to be an expert, having a reason-
able level of knowledge in the broader subject area is
valuable as we navigate through the following steps:

1. Identifying a Broad Area of Interest
¢ We begin by exploring our professional interests
and passions.
¢ We need to consider what aspects of our field
intrigue us the most.

¢ For instance, as a teacher, we might be drawn to
teaching methodology or the increasing incidents
of student violence.

2. Dividing Broad Areas Into Subareas
* Once we have identified a broad area of inter-
est, break it down into smaller, more focused
subareas.
¢ For example, if we are researching student vio-
lence, subareas could include family profiles,
causes of violence, or the impact on society.

3. Focusing on and Selecting an Area of Interest

¢ Apply the principle of ‘selective perception’ to
prioritize specific subareas for research. But this
selective perception that aligns with their pre-
conceived beliefs or preference can lead to biased
conclusions and hinder the objectivity of the
research.

* Understand that we can’t investigate every aspect
comprehensively.

4. Identifying the Gaps and Raising Research Ques-
tions

* Within our chosen area, list all the questions we
aim to answer through research.

e These questions will guide our investigation and
help define the research problem.
5. Formulation of Broad Objectives
* Develop broad research objectives based on the
questions we have generated.
* Objectives should naturally stem from the
research questions.

6: Assessing and Reviewing Objectives
¢ As you refine our research problem, critically
evaluate our objectives.

¢« Ensure they align with our narrowed focus and
that we have clearly identified the study popula-
tion for appropriate respondent selection

EXTENsIve LiTERATURE REview - EXPLORING THE
WorLp oF RESEARCH

A literature review supplements our existing knowl-
edge by providing a comprehensive overview of exist-
ing research, theories, and information on a particular
topic. It helps researchers and readers understand the
current state of knowledge in a field, identify gaps,
and build upon existing knowledge to advance under-
standing and contribute to the body of knowledge in
that area.

Objectives of Literature Review

1. Knowledge Enrichment: Literature review broadens
our understanding of the research problem.

2. Clarity and Focus: It brings clarity and precision to
our research problem, enhancing its credibility.

3. Methodology Improvement: Our research method-
ology benefits from this process.

4. Contextualization: It helps us understand how our
research contributes to existing knowledge.

The Literature Review Process

1. Searching: Start by seeking relevant literature from
sources like books and journals. Keep in mind that
there may be a lag of a few years between research
completion and journal publication.

2. Reviewing: Carefully examine and evaluate the
literature.

3. Theoretical Framework: Develop a theoretical and
conceptual framework based on your findings.

Sources of Literature: Books and journals are primary
sources. In today’s digital age, the internet is also a valu-
able resource, but be vigilant about content authenticity.

Bibliography: At the end of our project, we provide a
comprehensive bibliography listing all our information
sources.

DEFINING RESEARCH OBJECTIVES

Research objectives are the guiding stars of our study.
They communicate your study’s purpose and specifics
clearly to our readers.

Types of Objectives
1. Main Objectives or Aims: These are like the big goals
of our research, telling us what we want to achieve.

2. Sub-objectives: These break down specific aspects of
our research within the main framework.

Guidelines for Writing Objectives

1. Numerical Listing: List objectives numerically for
clarity

2. Precision: Word objectives precisely and specifically

3. Simplicity: Each objective should address a single
aspect of the study

4. Action-Oriented: Use action verbs like ‘to determine,’
‘to find out,’ ‘to ascertain,’ or ‘to explore.’



=== Page 39 ===
2.18

| Chapter 2 | 2

Tailoring Objectives to Research Types: The wording of
objectives determines the research type (descriptive, cor-
relational, experimental) and the research design needed
to achieve them. For instance:

* Descriptive Study Objective: ‘To describe the types
of incentives provided by IT organizations in Chandi-
garh to their employees.’

¢ Correlational Study Objective: ‘To ascertain the
impact of coaching classes on students’ performance.’

Selecting the Right Type of Research Problem

When choosing a research problem, it is important to be
strategic. There are countless problems in the world, but
we cannot tackle all of them. Here are some key things to
keep in our mind:

1. Broad Area of Interest: We need to pick something
that genuinely interests us. Research can be a long
and challenging journey, so our topic should keep us
motivated.

2. Manageable Size: Make sure that our topic is not too
vast. Break it down into a manageable chunk that we
can handle with the time and resources we have. It
should be specific and clear, it should not be too small
that does not matter to us, but not so big that it is dif-
ficult to deal with.

3. Defining Concepts: Be clear about what we are
studying. Concepts and their measurement matter a
lot. There should be no confusion at this stage as null
hypothesis, sampling, data collection and analysis is
being done on this basis.

4, Our Skill Set: Choose a topic that matches our skills
and expertise. We want to be confident in what we are
doing.

5. Relevance: Research should add to the stock of
previous knowledge so spending time and money
resources makes a sense. It should fill in knowl-
edge gaps and make a difference to the different
stakeholders.

6. Data Availability: Make sure we can get your hands
on the data we need - No data means no research!
7, Ethical Considerations: Think about any ethical

issues that might come up. They have been discussed
separately later in this chapter.

Example: Main Objectives and Sub-objectives:

Let’s state our ‘main objective’ of research study is to
explore how using modern teaching techniques affects
student performance. Here, are some sub-objectives:

1. Measure the relationship between modern teaching
techniques and student performance.

2. Compare how modern teaching techniques are used
in government and private schools.

3. Study the impact of modern teaching on students’
motivation to learn.

Concepts, Indicators and Variables

In research, we use concepts to clarify the things.For
example, the concepts of poverty may be different in
USA, India or Pakistan — such concepts may differ as per
the situation. So, we need to define them in the context
where research is being done. That is where the indica-
tors and variables come in. They help make concepts
measurable. For instance, if we are looking at teaching
effectiveness, class performance, or job satisfaction, these
concepts might mean different things to different people.
Indicators like assets and income can help measure con-
cepts like richness or poverty. These indicators can take
on different values, making them variables.

Concept Mapping

Imagine concept mapping as a visual way to show how
ideas are connected. It helps organize our thoughts and
ideas about our research topic

UNDERSTANDING THE TYPES OF VARIABLES

Variables are like the building blocks of research. They
come in different flavours, and given below is a simple
breakdown of all the variables:

1, Categorical and Quantitative Variables

* Quantitative Variables: These are all about
quantity or degree. For instance, your annual
income can vary in amount. Think of it like money
- it can be a lot or a little.

* Gategorical Variables: These deal with different
types or kinds. A good example is gender - it’s not
about amount but about the kind of gender.

2. Independent and Dependent Variables

* Independent Variables (IV): These are the ones
you can tweak or manipulate. Think of them as
the cause in an experiment. If you’re a scientist,
you're in control of these.

¢ Dependent Variables (DV): These are the ones
that change when we manipulate the indepen-
dent variables. They are like the outcome or the
response. For instance, if we are testing how
coaching affects student performance, coaching
is the independent variable, and student perfor-
mance is the dependent variable.

¢ The relation between IV and DV is known through
regression analysis.

3. Intervening Variables and Extraneous Variables

¢ Intervening Variables: These are like the middle-
men. They link the independent and dependent
variables and help us understand the process. For
instance, if smoking affects lung cancer, tissue
damage can be the middleman in that relationship.

¢ Extraneous Variables: These are like the unin-
vited guests at a party. They’re not part of your
experiment, but they can mess things up. They
might affect the dependent variable, even though
you didn’t manipulate them. You need to control
them to see if the independent variable really has
an impact.

4, Active and Attribute Variables:

¢ Active Variables: We can control these variables
during our study. It is like having the remote to
change the channel on our TV.

* Attribute Variables: These are hands-off — it
means that something should not be touched or
interfered with. We can’t change them, control
them, or manipulate them at our will. They just
are what they are, like our age or gender.

5. Categorical and Continuous Variables:
* Categorical Variables: These come in categories
or groups. There are three types:
(i) Constant Variable: It’s like having only one
flavour of ice cream - no variety.
(ii) Dichotomous Variable: Think of it as a two-
choice question - Yes or No.

(iii) Polytomous Variable: This one has more
than two categories, like ranking something
as below average, average, or above average.

* Continuous Variables: These can take on any
value within a range. It is like having a scale that
can show any weight between two points, not just
whole numbers.

Variables might sound complicated, but they are just dif-
ferent ways to look at the things we study in research and
to be use accordingly.

Understanding Types of Measurement Scaies

In research, we need to measure things, and how we
Measure them can vary. Let us look into the different
Measurement scales:

1. Scale - The Measuring Tool:
A scale is like a tool that helps us measure or quantify
stuff. It is what we use to understand and put num-
bers to things.

2. Levels of Measurements - Four Types
We have got four different scales of measurement.

(a) Nominal Scale

* Nominal scales are a basic form of measurement
where data is categorized into distinct labels or cat-
egories. It doesn’t involve assigning numerical values;
instead, it is focused on naming or categorizing items.
Nominal scales are about classifying and identifying
objects rather than assigning numeric values.

° Usage: Nominal scales are commonly used for quali-
tative or categorical data, such as gender (Male,
Female, Transgender), colours (Red, Blue, Green); or
animal types (Mammals, Birds, Reptiles). They help
organize data into discrete categories.

* Limitations: Nominal scales do not provide any infor-
mation about the order or magnitude of differences
between categories. They are primarily used for clas-
sification purposes.

(b) Ordinal Scale

* Ordinal Scalecombines naming and ordering ele-
ments. It allows us to rank or order data categories,
but it doesn’t provide information about the precise
differences or intervals between them. In essence, it
signifies the relative position or rank of items.

* Usage: Ordinal scales are frequently applied when
dealing with data that can be ranked but lacks spe-
cific numeric values. Examples include ranking uni-
versity students as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or using terms like
‘Very often,’ ‘Often,’ ‘Not so often,’ and ‘Not present at
all’ to assess frequency.

* Limitations: While ordinal scales offer a sense of
order, they do not indicate the exact difference
between ranks. The gaps between categories are
unknown or unequal.

(c} Interval Scale

* An interval scale is more precise than nominal and
ordinal scales as it not only names and orders data
but also indicates the exact intervals between values.
It possesses equal intervals between points but lacks
a true zero point, meaning zero does not indicate the
absence of a characteristic.

¢ Usage: Interval scales are commonly employed in
various scientific fields to measure temperature
(e.g., Celsius or Fahrenheit). In such scales, the inter-
vals between each degree are consistent, but the
zero point (0°C or O°F) doesn’t imply the absence of
temperature.

¢ Limitations: The absence of a true zero point limits
the application of interval scales in situations where a
true zero is required. This means that operations like
multiplication and division are not meaningful, and
only addition and subtraction can be performed on
interval data.

(d) Ratio Scale

¢ The ratio scale is the most advanced measurement
scale that includes all the characteristics of nominal,
ordinal, and interval scales. In addition to naming,
ordering, and specifying equal intervals between val-
ues, it possesses an absolute zero point, making it the
most informative and versatile scale.

¢ Usage: The ratio scale is widely used in various sci-
entific and statistical applications. Examples include
measuring age, weight, height, income, and test
scores. In these cases, not only can you compare the
sizes of intervals, but you can also perform meaning-
ful mathematical operations like multiplication and
division.

¢ Limitations: While the ratio scale provides a wealth
of information, it may not be applicable to all types
of data. Some characteristics or attributes may not
have a true zero point, preventing the use of the ratio
scale.

ATTITUDINAL SCALES IN RESEARCH

When we want to find out what students think about a
teacher, we use questionnaires. These questionnaires can
be open-ended, where students describe their thoughts
freely, or close-ended, where they choose from options
like strongly agree, agree, undecided, disagree, and
strongly disagree.

Types of Attitudinal Scales

In qualitative research, attitudinal scales are super impor-
tant. Let’s look at the different types:

1. Likert Scale:

¢ It’s the easiest to make. We assume that each
statement on the scale is equally important.

* For example, if we are rating a teacher’s quality,
different aspects like knowledge, communication,
and organization might matter. People might fee]
differently about each aspect. So, we give scores
to their responses.

* Some people might have a more positive attitude,
so they get higher scores. Instead of SA, A, U, D,
and SD, we might use numbers like 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1,

Statements About Teacher SA A U D SD

1. Knows the subject well (+)

2. Willing to solve students’
problems (+)

3. Have poor communication
skills (-)

4. Is hard to approach (—)
5. Good teaching skills (+)
6. Liking/disliking (+/—)

2. Thurstone Scale

¢ This one assigns weight to different statements.
For instance, solving student problems might get
a weight of 1, while subject knowledge gets 1.5.

¢ Scores are calculated based on these weights.

3. Guttman Scale
° This scale is a bit complex and uses the ratio scale. It’s
not easy to create.

Factor ANALYSIS

Factor analysis is like a magic trick. They condense and
simplify data. It lets researchers describe lots of stuff
using just a few factors. This brings the things to an opti-
mal level, so, we can manage fewer variables, making it
easier to analyse.

TESTING OF HYPOTHESIS

This is actually a part of planning. We assume that our
study is scientific and quantitative, we make a plan for
testing the population parameter with sample statis-
tic. This is planning stage only as we develop a techni-
cal background — sampling and data collection have
not been collected yet. First of all, we adopt a neutral
stance in the form of ‘null (and alternative) hypothesis’,
and population parameter is decided. Thereafter, in next
steps, we workout research design, sampling, then data
is collected. Then ‘a test statistic’ will be done. Its value is
compared with critical values, and ultimately results are
drawn. As many questions are asked in NET, JRF Exam,
we have discussed these aspects separately in details,
but new students will have to go for multiple readings
of them.

Step 2: Preparing Research Design
and Study Design

Now that we have set up our hypotheses, the next cru-
cial step is crafting a research design. Think of it as your
roadmap for conducting the research. This step-by-step
approach helps answer fundamental questions such as:

e What is the scope of our research study?

¢ What type of data do we need to collect?

¢ How should we collect and analyze this data?
¢ And why should we choose these methods?

Each decision in your research design needs a solid justi-
fication because you’re investing resources at every turn.
It’s worth noting that many research methods are essen-
tially research designs or closely tied to them.

Nature of Research Design

Research design is like the master plan, structure, and
strategy that guides your investigation. It’s the blueprint
for how you'll find answers to your research questions.
When creating a research design, you'll need to consider:

1. Objectives of Our Research Study

2. Selection of Data Collection Methods: Use ‘of sur-
veys, interviews, observations, or a combination? Our
choice should align with your research goals.

3. Source of Information - Sample Design: To select
our study’s participants or data sources our results are
representative and reliable.

4. Tools for Data Collection
5. Data Analysis - Qualitative and Quantitative

Every step in our research design should have a purpose
and connect to our overall research goals.

BeNeFits OF RESEARCH DESIGN

Research design plays a crucial role in ensuring the suc-
cess of our research project. Here is why it matters to a
researcher:

1. Efficiency: Research design helps streamline our
research process, making it more efficient. It’s like
planning our route before a road trip to avoid unnec-
essary detours.

2. Resource Optimization: With a well-thought-out
design, we can make the most of our resources—get-
ting the maximum information while minimizing the
use of time and money. It’s like budgeting wisely for a
big purchase.

3. Flexibility: Research design offers flexibility. It
allows us to adapt and make necessary adjustments
as we go along. Think of it as having multiple paths to
reach our destination.

4. Bias Reduction: It helps minimize bias in‘ our
research. Bias can skew (deviate) our results, so a
good design helps ensure our findings are as impartial
and accurate as possible.

5. Reliability and Objectivity: A solid research design
enhances the reliability and objectivity of our study.
It’s like building a sturdy bridge to cross a river; we
want it to hold up under scrutiny.

Types of Research Designs

Though the following have been discussed under types of
research, they are called as research designs as well.

1. Exploratory Research: Use this when the problem is
unstructured or not clearly defined, and we want to
explore, generate ideas, or gain initial insights.

2. Descriptive Research: Use this when we havea struc-
tured problem, and we want to provide a detailed
description of a situation or phenomenon.

3. Causal Research: Use this when we want to establish
cause-and-effect relationships between variables and
have a structured problem in mind.

4. Correlational Research: This design is used to
examine the statistical association between two or
more variables without implying causation. It’s useful
when we want to understand the degree and direc-
tion of relationships between variables.

5. Cross-Sectional Research: Cross-sectional studies col-
lect data from a sample or population at a single point in
time. This design is often used for surveys and snapshots
of social, economic, or demographic conditions.

6. Longitudinal Research: In longitudinal studies, data
is collected from the same subjects or groups over an
extended period. This design is suitable for tracking
changes, developments, or trends over time.

The choice of design depends on the research objectives
and the nature of the research questions being addressed.

Study design on the Basis of Contacts

Now, let’s talk about the different types of studies based
on how data is collected:

1. Cross-Sectional Studies
* Here, the data is gathered only once during the

research process. It doesn’t have to be collected all at
once; it can be spread out over a period, like a week or
a month. For instance, you might collect data on the
holiday preferences of software professionals in India.
It’s like taking a snapshot at a particular moment.

2. Longitudinal Studies

The data is collected at multiple points in time. Imag-
ine tracking the progress of a group of patients after
they have taken a new drug. We need data from dif-
ferent time points to see how they are doing. Similarly,
organizations might collect data on employee satis-
faction before and after a pay raise. It’s like creating a
time-lapse video to see changes over a span of time.

Study Design Based on the Reference Period

1. Retrospective Study Design: This design is employed
when the focus is on a phenomenon or situation that
has occurred in the past. Researchers gather data



=== Page 41 ===
2.22

from historical records or through participant recall
to study events that have already transpired.

2. Prospective Study Design: This design pertains to the
likely prevalence or occurrence of a phenomenon in
the future. Researchers collect data from participants
over a period of time to observe and study events or
trends that are expected to unfold in the future.

Study Design Based on the Basis of Nature of
Investigation

1. Experimental Research Design: Experimental
research designs are characterized by the deliberate
manipulation of one or more independent variables
to observe their effect on one or more dependent vari-
ables. These designs aim to establish cause-and-effect
relationships. Key features of experimental research
include:

* Control: Researchers carefully control and manipu-
late variables to minimize the influence of extraneous
factors.

* Randomization: Participants are typically assigned
randomly to different experimental conditions to
ensure unbiased results.

* Experimental and Control Groups: Experimental
designs often involve comparing the outcomes of an
experimental group (subjected to the independent
variable) with a control group (not subjected to the
independent variable).

Common types of experimental designs include pre-post
test designs, Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), and
laboratory experiments.

2. Non-Experimental Research Design: Non-
experimental research designs are less concerned
with manipulating variables and establishing causa-
tion. Instead, they focus on observing and describing
relationships, patterns, or trends without intervening
in the natural course of events. Key characteristics of
non-experimental research include:

* Observation: Researchers primarily observe and col-
lect data from participants or sources without intro-
ducing any controlled interventions.

* Natural Settings: Non-experimental research often
takes place in real-world settings.

* Exploratory or Descriptive: These designs are more
suitable for exploring, describing, or understanding
phenomena as they naturally occur.

Common types of non-experimental research designs
include observational studies, cross-sectional studies,
case studies, surveys, and content analysis.

3. Cohort, Placebo, and Action Research: Cohort and
placebo designs, along with action research, are typi-
cally considered types of non-experimental research:

° Cohort Studies: These follow a group (cohort) of
individuals over an extended period to examine the
development of certain outcomes or conditions.
These are non-experimental because researchers do

__ ary

not manipulate variables but rather observe and com.
pare groups based on specific criteria. For example, q
research design to assess the long-term impact of an
online learning program on students’ academic per
formance and career outcomes.

* Placebo-Controlled Studies: Placebo-controlled
studies are often a part of clinical trials and medica]
research. While they involve experimental elements,
they are considered non-experimental in the broader
sense of research methodology because they focus on
the effects of a treatment (placebo) without manipu-
lating variables beyond the administration of a pla-
cebo.

* Action Research: As discussed this research involves
researchers actively working with practitioners to
solve real-world problems collaboratively.

Step 3: Developing a Data
Collection Instrument

Data is the information used to represent facts in research.
Here are some key points about data:

1. Data shows facts related to the variables we are study-
ing. °

2. Data is analyzed to see if it matches our research pre-
dictions, which are formed as hypotheses.

3. If data matches predictions, it supports our null
hypothesis.

4. Ifdata doesn’t match predictions, it rejects the hypoth-
esis.

Types of Data: The quality of our research output
depends on the tools we use to collect data. Data can be
categorized as primary or secondary and as objective or
subjective, as well as qualitative or quantitative.

Primary Data Versus SECONDARY Data

° Primary Data: This is data collected specifically for
our current research project. It is gathered firsthand
through surveys, observations, or experiments. This
will be more expensive and challenging to obtain, but
it is highly reliable as it is collected directly for our
specific research goals.

research Aptitude

. secondary Data: These facts are gathered from out-
side resources like periodicals, books, newspapers,
the internet, TV, radio, and so on. This is a speedier
and more economical way to obtain information. It
becomes more helpful when we don’t have access to
the original source. We need to check the reliability
and pertinence of secondary data forour study.

Objective Versus Subjective Data
« Objective Data: This data is not influenced by per-
sonal opinions; it’s factual and independent.
» Subjective Data: This data can be someone’s opinion
or is based on the researcher’s perspective.

Qualitative Versus Quantitative Data

¢ Qualitative Data: This describes things without
assigning numbers. It often comes from unstruc-
tured interviews and requires interpretation by the
researcher.

Quantitative Data: This involves measurements rep-
resented by numbers. It’s ready for statistical analysis,
often requiring a larger sample size for more general-
ized results.

Observation Method

e Structured Versus Unstructured Observations:
Structured is for descriptive research, while unstruc-
tured suits exploratory research.
Participant Observation: Researchers actively par-
ticipate in the group they’re studying.
Structured Observation: Observations are made ina
more controlled setting.
Naturalistic Observation: Observations are made in
a natural environment.
Disguised Observation: Researchers observe with-
out participants knowing.

Limitations

* Some behaviours aren’t directly observable.

° Itcan be expensive.

¢ Difficult to measure feelings, beliefs, and attitudes.
¢ Limited to frequent behaviours.

Survey Method
¢ Structured Surveys: Standardized questions asked
in the same way to all respondents.
* Unstructured Surveys: Interviewer has flexibility
based on responses.

Advantages

¢ Quick and cost-effective

* Suitable for various types of information
Limitations

¢ Privacy concerns
* Reluctance from respondents
¢ Potential biases

¢ Finally, list the questions themselves.

Understanding Questionnaires

¢ A questionnaire is a set of questions for respondents
to answer.

¢ Used in structured surveys or interviews.

e Respondents read, interpret, and write down their
answers.

« Also called an interview schedule when the researcher
asks questions and records responses.

¢ Three basic types: Closed-ended, open-ended, or a
combination.

(a) Closed-Ended Questionnaire

¢ Typically includes multiple-choice or scale
questions



=== Page 42 ===

¢ Suitable for large-scale administration
* Data can be easily computerized for analysis

(b) Open-Ended Questionnaire

° Offers flexibility for respondents to answer in
their own words
¢ Allows for written responses

(c) Combined Questionnaire

¢ Combines closed-ended and open-ended
questions.

¢ Begins with closed-ended questions, followed by
open-ended or detailed responses.

(3 Step 4: Selecting Samples

In research, choosing a sample by researcher is really
important. It is important since it affects how reliable and
practical his results will be. A researcher does not have the
flexibility to converse with each and every member of the
population as he has limitations of time and resources.
Thus, sampling becomes desirable. The sample should be
random to the extent possible to make the study unbiased.

Thus, representative sample should, in theory, give
a fair representation of the population as a whole.
Emphasize that the sample should be representative of
the population to ensure the study’s validity. Population
is the whole group being studied.

To do this, researchers carefully choose their sample by
taking into account several demographic parameters like
sex, age, educational attainment, socioeconomic status,
and marital status.

For instance, a representative sample should contain
roughly 50% women if the whole population of interest is
female on average.

POPULATION, SAMPLE, AND THEIR IMPACT ON
INFERENCES

Before delving into sampling techniques, let’s understand
the factors that can affect the inferences (results) drawn
from a sample:

1. Sample Size: Larger samples tend to yield greater
accuracy in research outcomes.

2. Variation in Population: The more diverse the popu-
lation, the greater the uncertainty in the study’s results.

3. Population Consistency: A consistent population
boosts confidence in the quality of research outcomes.

4. Population Variations: Conversely, higher variations
in the population necessitate larger sample sizes.

i Exploring Sampling Techniques
Now, let’s delve into the two primary categories of sam-
pling techniques:

PROBABILITY OR RANDOM SAMPLES

In this sampling, each person in the population has the
equal, independent, and known chances of being selected.

Chapter 2

Although it is mostly accurate, there is always a statistica]
margin of error, which can be accounted for in the results.
Some important types include:

* Simple Random Sample: Every element or member
of the population has a known and equal chance of
being selected. Imagine a box of lottery tickets, each
representing a person in a city. With a simple ran-
dom sample, each ticket has an equal chance of being
drawn, ensuring fairness.

* Stratified Random Sample: This works better in

cases where the population is heterogeneous which
can be divided into different strata. Each stratum rep-
resents a homogeneous group, and random samples
are drawn from each group, ideally in proportion to
its population size.
For example, assume a college has 1000 students, 600
of whom are majoring in humanities and 400 in busi-
ness. There will be 60 students from the humanities
and 40 from business in a sample of 100, which is rep-
resentative of the general population.

* Cluster Sample: When there is a big population and
recognisable units, cluster sampling is used. Itincludes
grouping the population into non-overlapping catego-
ries and sampling the categories rather than the indi-
viduals within each category. This strategy, known as
‘multi-stage cluster sampling,’ is frequently applied in
national-level surveys. Consider doing a health sur-
vey on a national scale. A few states, certain particu-
lar cities within those states, and then homes within
those cities might be your first three choices.

Non-PRosBasiLity oR Non-RANDOM SAMPLING

Non-probability sampling techniques have less structure
and include items for the study based on convenience or
other factors. These approaches are speedier, but they
have a higher margin of error and could induce biases.
Some prominent types are:

*« Convenience Sampling: The population members
who are the simplest to get data from are chosen
by researchers. Convenience sampling is when you
approach customers who are easily approachable,
such as if you were conducting a survey at a mall.

¢ Judgment or Purposive Sampling: Researchers use
their judgment to select population members who are
likely to provide accurate information. This approach
is often used in historical or descriptive research. For
instance, if you’re studying exceptional athletes, you
might purposefully select individuals known for their
outstanding achievements.

* Quota Sampling: Quota sampling is like making sure
we have a little bit of everything in our study group.
Instead of picking people randomly, a researcher
choose them to match certain characteristics, like
age or gender. This way, our group represents differ-
ent types of people, even though it’s not completely
random. It helps when getting a completely random
group is hard, but it might not be as accurate.

2.25

esearch Aptitude

- Accidental Sampling: Similar to quota sampling,
accidental sampling occurs when researchers come
across individuals by chance, often in market research
settings. If you’re conducting surveys at a music festi-
val and interview attendees as you encounter them,
it’s a form of accidental sampling.

e Snowball Sampling: In this approach, information
is initially gathered from a few individuals who then
identify others for data collection, potentially creat-
ing a network of sample elements. This method is
commonly used in social network studies or when
studying hard-to-reach populations, such as individu-
als with rare medical conditions.

Determining Sample Design

Finally, designing the sample involves making three criti-
cal decisions: ,

1. The Sample Itself: Who will be surveyed, depending
on the type of information required?

2. Sample Size: How many individuals should ideally be
surveyed? This decision involves a trade-off between
cost and accuracy.

3. Sampling Method: Should probability or non-proba-
bility methods be adopted for sample selection?

The choice of sample size depends on the four P’s: pur-
pose, population, procedure, and publishing. Importantly,
the more diverse or heterogeneous the population, the
larger the sample size should be to ensure the reliability
of research findings.

Step 5: Writing a Research
Proposal

Aresearch proposal, usually spanning three to seven pages,
informs others about a proposed research project, whether
for academic theses or corporate research. It serves as a
roadmap summarizing the project’s core aspects.

UNDERSTANDING RESEARCH PROPOSALS

Aresearch proposal is a detailed blueprint by a researcher,
conveying the research’s essence.

The Diverse Purposes of Research proposals are as
follows:

1. Budget Request: Research projects span number of
years, so securing funding from universities, grant
agencies, or corporations is important.

2. Certification Requirements: In research for school
or work, certification rules are super important.
They help get the green light for research, check if
it’s doable, and make sure everyone does it fairly and
ethically.

Essential Research Proposal Elements
An effective research proposal must include:

1. Rationale: Clearly defining the research’s need,
addressing gaps or questions, and justifying its signifi-

cance.

2. Benefits and Beneficiaries: Describing expected
outcomes and who benefits, be it advancing knowl-
edge, societal impact, or corporate gain.

3. Data Collection: Outlining data types and meth-
odologies, including tools, surveys, interviews, or
experiments.

4. Data Analysis: Briefly discussing analytical methods
for deriving meaningful conclusions from collected
data.

5. Collaboration: Specifying required collaboration
or external assistance, demonstrating thorough
planning.

6. Duration and Resources: Defining project duration,
facility, equipment, and budget requirements, crucial
for financial support.

7. Research Team Credentials: Highlighting the team’s
qualifications, expertise, and prior research to inspire
confidence in their capabilities.

A well-structured research proposal bridges the research-
er’s vision and practical execution. It communicates the
project’s importance and potential impact to stakehold-
ers, whether funding agencies, academic institutions, or
corporations.

Mi Step 6: Collecting Data

When it comes to collecting relevant data, research-
ers have a multitude of methods at their disposal. The
choice of data collection method depends on several fac-
tors, including the nature of the investigation, scope and
objectives, financial considerations, time constraints, and
desired accuracy levels.

Primary Data CoLLecTiIon METHODS

Researchers primarily gather data through experi-
ments or surveys, both serving distinct purposes:

1. Experimentation: When researchers conduct experi-
ments, they acquire quantitative measurements,
which are further analyzed to test hypotheses.

2. Surveys: Surveys are another avenue for primary
data collection, and there are various methods to
choose from:

1. Observation: This method involves the investi-
gator observing subjects without direct interac-
tion. It’s suitable for capturing real-time data but
can be costly and is less suitable for large-scale
quantitative research.

2. Personal Interviews: Researchers employ a
structured approach with pre-determined ques-
tions. The effectiveness depends on the inter-
viewer’s skills.

3. Telephonic Interviews: Information is collected
via telephone, ideal for time-sensitive surveys.

Chapter 2

Selecting the appropriate data collection method hinges
on aligning the chosen approach with the research’s spe-
cific requirements and constraints.

Step 7: Processing and Analyzing
Data

Once data have been collected, the next critical step is
data processing and analysis. This involves a sequence
of closely related operations aimed at deriving meaning-
ful insights from raw data. Here is a breakdown of these
essential procedures:

Data CLASSIFICATION

1. Editing: The initial phase is data cleaning or editing.
This involves identifying and rectifying errors, miscal-
culations, misclassifications, or missing information.
The goal is to enhance data quality for coding.

2. Coding: The nature of data, whether quantita-
tive or qualitative, influences the coding process.
Quantitative data, such as numerical values, undergo
numerical coding, enabling tabulation and analy-
sis. Qualitative data may involve descriptive coding,
which identifies themes or patterns within the data.

Other Ways to Classify the Data
Data can be classified in various ways:
1. According to Attributes: Data can be categorized as

descriptive (e.g., literacy, religion) or numerical (e.g.,
weight, income).

¢ Further classification can be in two forms:
(a) Simple Classification: dividing into two classes

MBA degree 21 09 30

(b) Manifold Classification: dividing based on mul-
tiple attributes

‘Yes No Total
Gender M F M F M F
PG degree
Ph.D.

¢ According to Class Intervals: Quantitative data
like income, age, or weight are classified into
class intervals. For example, individuals with
income between 2001 and 74000 may form one
class. The number of items in each class is the
class’s frequency.

2. Tabulation: Tabulation involves summarizing and
presenting data in an organized format, typically
tables. This process serves several crucial purposes:

(i) Space Conservation: Tables condense data,
reducing the need for lengthy explanations.

(ii) Comparison Facilitation: Data comparison
becomes easier with tabulated information.

(iii) Error Detection: Tables aid in detecting errors
or omissions.

(iv) Statistical Computation Basis: Tabulated data
provide the foundation for various statistical cal-
culations.

Tabulation can be simple or complex, depending on
whether it results in one-way or two-way tables. Com-
plex tabulation often leads to two-way tables that
convey information about two interrelated character-
istics.

Data Analysis

After tabulation, data analysis ensues, driven by math-
ematical and statistical techniques such as percent-
ages, averages, correlation coefficients, and regres-
sion, depending on whether the data are qualitative or
quantitative.

Qualitative Data Analysis

Qualitative data analysis is a flexible process with no strict
rules. Researchers often use content analysis to identify key
themes from interview responses. Here’s how it works:

1. Identify the Main Themes: Researchers must under-
stand the main ideas expressed in responses, even if
different words or languages are used. For example,
in interviews about favorite vacation spots, ‘beach,’
‘seaside, and ‘oceanfront’ might all relate to the
theme of ‘coastal destinations.’

2, Assign Codes to the Main Themes: If you want to
count how often a theme appears in interviews, assign
codes. For instance, you might code all references to
‘mountain getaways’ with the label ‘mountain.’

3. Classify Responses Under the Main Themes: After
identifying themes, categorize responses from inter-
view transcripts accordingly. For the vacation study,
responses mentioning ‘ski resorts’ and ‘alpine regions’
would be classified under the theme ‘mountain
destinations.’

4. Integrate Themes and Responses into the Report:
Finally, integrate these themes and associated
responses into your research report. How you present
them depends on how you want to convey findings to
your audience.

Example: Imagine you conducted interviews about peo-
ple’s favorite books. You identified ‘classic literature’ as a
main theme. You assigned a code, ‘classics,’ to it. Then,
you sorted responses mentioning ‘Pride and Prejudice,’
‘Moby Dick,’ and ‘War and Peace’ under the ‘classics’
theme. In your report, you could discuss the popularity: of
classic literature among respondents.

Quantitative Data Analysis

Quantitative data analysis is best suited for extensive,
well-structured surveys using carefully crafted question-
naires. You can perform data analysis manually or with
the help of a computer.

Research Aptitude

1. Manual Data Analysis: If you have a relatively small
number of respondents and not too many variables,
manual analysis can be done. This method is useful for
calculating frequencies and basic cross-tabulations.
It involves directly recording data onto large graph
paper in columns. However, it can be time-consuming.

Example: Suppose you conducted a survey about
people’s favorite colors, and you have a limited num-
ber of responses, You can manually tally the frequency
of each color mentioned.

2, Data Analysis Using a Computer: For larger datasets

or more complex analyses, computer-based methods
are efficient. You'll need to be familiar with appropri-
ate software, such as SPSS for Windows, and have
some knowledge of statistics. However, entering data
can be labour-intensive, and errors in data entry can
affect results.
Example: In a nationwide survey on voting prefer-
ences, you have thousands of responses. Using statis-
tical software, you can calculate percentages and run
tests to determine the significance of differences in
voting patterns among various demographics.

In both manual and computer-based analysis, you
should subject relationships or differences to significance
tests. These tests help evaluate the validity of data in sup-
porting or contradicting your original or new hypotheses.

Generalization and Interpretation:

In research means forming a theory based on repeatedly
testing a hypothesis. That is called as generalization that
has been initially discussed under features. On the other
hand, interpretation involves explaining findings using
existing theories. Interpretation, usually done in qualita-
tive study, can spark new questions, prompting additional
research.

lal Step 8: Writing A Research Report

Writing a report is the last and, for many, the most
difficult step of the research process. The report informs
the world what you have done, what you have discov-
ered, and what conclusions you have drawn from your
findings. The report should be written in an academic
style. The language should be formal and not journalistic.

Introduction

This section introduces the research, setting out the
main aims and objectives. It is actually a rationale for the
research.

Theoretical Framework and Review of Literature

This section includes all the background research infor-
mation that has been obtained from the literature review.
You must indicate from where all the information was
obtained. Thus, it is mandatory to keep a complete record
of everything the researcher has read. Otherwise, there are
chances that the researcher could be accused of plagiarism,
which is akin to intellectual theft.

Research Design

This section includes all practical details followed for the
research. After reading this, any interested party should
be able to replicate the research study. It includes the
methods used for data collection, sampling procedures,
tools used for data collection, and analysis of data.

Data Analysis and Interpretation

If you have conducted a large quantitative survey, this
section may contain tables, graphs, pie charts, and associ-
ated statistics. If you have conducted a qualitative piece of
research, this section may be a descriptive prose.

Summary and Conclusion

In this section, you sum up your findings and draw conclu-
sions from them, perhaps in relation to other research or
literature.

Recommendations

If the research has been conducted for any client organi-
zation, this section could be treated as the most important
part of the report. Sometimes, this section is included at
the beginning of the report.

Suggestions for Further Research

Research is a continuous process. This section shows
how research could be continued. This could happen as
some results are inconclusive or the research itself has
thrown up many more research questions that need to be
addressed. It also shows the honesty and integrity of the
researcher-that he has a wider perspective and has actu-
ally not tried to cover up the shortcomings.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESIS AND DISSERTATION

1. Thesis:

¢ Post Graduate’s Level: In many countries, a
thesis is associated with a Master’s degree. The
students are often required to complete a thesis
as part of their Master’s program.

e¢ Research Focus: The student conducts original
research on a specific topic or question within
their field of study.

* Scope: It tends to be shorter and less extensive
than a dissertation.

2. Dissertation:

¢ Doctoral Level: A dissertation is typically
associated with a doctoral degree, such as a
Ph.D / Fellowships/ IIM Fellowships in India.

¢ In-Depth Research: They often involve a
deeper and more extensive investigation into a
particular subject.

¢ Original Contribution: This might involve the
development of new theories, significant data
collection, or ground breaking analysis.

¢ Defense: Doctoral candidates often defend their
dissertations in front of a committee of experts
in their field.



Format and Styles of Referencing

A referencing style is a set of rules that tell you how to
acknowledge the thoughts, ideas, and works of others in
a particular way.

Referencing plays a crucial role in the following:

1. Successful academic writing
2. Avoiding plagiarism
3. Key to your assignments and research

Earlier, after the last step of research steps, we discussed
‘Research Report Format’ that may vary somewhat accord-
ing to university as well. Different types of sources have
different formatting requirements in the bibliography.
Background research plan and bibliography worksheet
help in the development of bibliography.

There are standards for documenting sources of infor-
mation in research papers. Even though different journals
may use a slightly different format for the bibliography,
they all contain thé same basic information. The most
basic information is that each reference should have the
author’s name, the title, the date, and the source.

In research areas, the two most commonly used
guidelines for this formatting are published by the MLA
(Modern Language Association) and the APA (American
Psychological Association). The MLA guidelines call the
bibliography ‘works cited’.

The APA guidelines call the bibliography Reference List.

If Research Biases-Simplified

In research, it’s crucial to stay objective and avoid biases
that can skew the data’s accuracy. Here are common
biases to watch out for:

1, External Influences: Your culture or media exposure
can shape your world view.

2. Personal Bias: Your beliefs and experiences can
impact your judgment.

3. Observer Bias: People may interpret events differ-
ently, influenced by their backgrounds and roles.

4, Expectancy Bias: Researchers may see what they
expect, rather than staying objective.

5. Placebo Bias: People might believe in a treatment’s
effectiveness, even when it’s a placebo. Patients feel
better because they believe they are receiving a ben-
eficial treatment, even though the treatment itself is
inactive or a placebo..

Testing of Hypothesis - A Detailed
Study of Tecnical Aspects

Though we have taken a brief idea of testing of hypothesis
on page 2.29, but this being very significant, its detailed
study is important from exam point of view, where ques-
tions are directly asked, even from Type 1 , Type 2 errors.
So, let’s look at it again in a detailed manner.

Aresearcher’s hunch or prediction about an outcome is
called a hypothesis. It is not a statement of fact, but rather
an educated guess or assumption about some phenom-
enon. Researchers may have one or more hypotheses,
which are the questions they want to address and pre-
dictions about possible relationships between the things
they want to investigate (variables).

A well-formulated hypothesis has the following
features:

¢ It is specific and testable.

e It is parsimonious, meaning that it is the simplest
explanation for the phenomenon being studied.

e It may be generalizable, meaning that it has the poten-
tial to be applied to a wider population or setting.

Hypotheses are tested by collecting information to deter-
mine if the researcher’s hunch was correct. They play a
central role in the scientific method, which is a process
of systematic inquiry that is used to test hypotheses and
develop new theories.

Main Functions oF HyPoTHeses
Researchers often have questions they want to answer,
such as understanding relationships between things
using variables. While making a hypothesis isn’t always
required, it serves several key purposes:

1. Focus and Clarity - It brings focus, clarity, and speci-
ficity to the research study.

2. Sample Designing: it helps in designing the sample
(-This function is very important to know the truth.
This guides the data collection and analysis process.

3. Objectivity: It makes the study more objective by
reducing the potential for bias.

4. Theory Development: It generalizes and thus facili-
tates the development of theories. This communi-
cates the research to others.

research Aptitude

5, Making research innovative: This generates new
research questions.

with this research gets more focused, rigorous, and mean-
ingful. These questions are called hypotheses.

Types OF HYPOTHESES

1. Descriptive Hypothesis: These describe characteris-
tics. For example, “The current urban unemployment
rate in India is 10%,’

2. Relational Hypothesis: They indicate relationships
between variables. For instance, ‘Urban parents tend
to spend more on their children’s education.’

3. Explanatory Hypothesis: These explain cause-and-
effect relationships. For example, ‘When salaries rise,
spending on food also increases.’

Technical Basics of Testing of
Hypothesis

The whole discussion on testing of hypothesis moves
around normal distribution. So we need to discuss this ina
simplified manner. This will help us in the understanding
the concept of ‘Null Hypothesis’, Alternative Hypothesis,
population parameter, sample statistic, types of errors etc.

Normal Distribution: The term describes a specific prob-
ability distribution. It is called ‘normal’ because it is a
common and widely observed pattern in various natural
phenomena and data sets. This is a bell-shaped curve that
describes how data is distributed. The word ‘normal’ was
suggested by Carl Friedrich Gauss.

Figure 2.8 Diagram of normal distribution
Normal distribution has the following main features:

1. Symmetry: The picture looks the same on both sides
of its peak (mean). If you were to fold a normal distri-
bution in half, the two sides would match.

2. Bell-shaped Curve: This curve shows one highest
point at the average value. As we move away from
that mean in either direction, the frequency of values
decreases symmetrically.

3. Mean, Median, and Mode Alignment: The mean
(average), median (middle value), and mode (most
frequent value) carry the same value and occur at the
centre of the distribution.

4. Tails Extending to Infinity: The tails of the distri-
bution extend infinitely in both directions, which

2.31

means there is a very small but non-zero probability
of extreme values (far from the mean) occurring.

5. Empirical Rule: This is known as ‘68-95-99.7 to recall
easily.

° Approximately 68.27% of data falls within one
standard deviation of mean.
¢ About 95.45% of data falls within two standard
deviations of mean.
* Nearly 99.73% of data falls within three standard
deviations of mean.
Finally, in practice, data is not always normally distrib-
uted. However, researchers often try to approximate a
normal distribution in their data analysis. This is because
the normal distribution is a useful tool for correcting
errors in data analysis.

Steps in Statistical Hypothesis
Testing

Hypothesis testing involves collecting sample data, apply-
ing statistical tests, interpreting findings, and adjusting
our understanding of the research as we go along. It’s like
detective work for researchers — we start with a theory
(hypotheses), gather clues (data), and determine if our
theory holds up.

Step 1: FoRMULATE THE NULL AND ALTERNATIVE
HYPOTHESES

The null hypothesis is a statement about a population
parameter that is assumed to be true for the purpose of
the test. The alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the
null hypothesis.

(Kindly note that hypothesis is singular and hypotheses
is plural.)

Nutt Hypotuesis (H,)

* Null usually means that there is no difference between
variables. This hypothesis is basically a statement
about the population parameter that is being tested
in a research study with the help of sample statistic.
Thus, there is there is no difference between the pop-
ulation mean and the sample mean.

° This is actually taking a neutral position initially that
compels us to test that position with the help of sam-
ple data (sample statistic).

* Population Parameter: We take a population param-
eter that may be a actual value(for example 80 marks)
or hypothetical value. For example, this value is taken
or assumed to be 80.

Example: Majority of us know that COVAXIN was effec-
tive in dealing with Covid19 in India, but we will always
make null hypothesis that ‘COVAXIN’ was not effective
in treating Covid19. Thus, the use of word ‘No’ or ‘Not’ is
mandatory in setting null hypothesis. Alternative hypoth-
esis will say that COVAXIN was effective. Then research-
ers will collect data to show that null is rejected and alter-
native hypothesis is accepted.

Age has no effect no cell

ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS (H,)

¢ If we reject the null hypothesis based on sample data,
we accept the alternative hypothesis.

* The alternative hypothesis (H,) is the statement that
contradicts the nuli hypothesis and suggests that
there is a significant difference or effect. ‘

‘Note that the mention of ‘significant difference’ in above
sentence points us towards the alternative hypothesis.
This guides us to the next step, which is establishing the
significance level.’

Step 2: Set Lever oF SIGNIFICANCE

The significance level (c) is the threshold for making a
decision about the null hypothesis.

The acceptance or rejection of null hypothesis depends
upon the ‘critical values’ which are determined on the
basis of significance level and the test statistic. Common
levels are 1%, 5%, or 10%.

Note that significance level is actually a pre specified
probability threshold. The ‘validity’of a test (that is being
evaluated) is determined through tests of significance.

The significance level, is denoted by o (alpha), that is
akin to Type I error (discussed separately).

Step 3: Cottect Sampce Data

* Emphasize that a random sample is preferred because
it provides more valid and generalizable results.

° The sample statistic is calculated from the sample data.

° We need to recall that sample statistic is used to esti-
mate the population parameter(discussed in step 1).
Actually, we are taking help of sample to test popula-
tion parameter (so some errors can’t be avoided).

* Sample statistic and population parameter are part of
inferential statistics.

Step 4: CALCULATE THE TEST STATISTIC

* The test statistic is a formula that involves the sample
statistic and, in some cases, the population parameter
(or its hypothesized value as stated in the null hypothe-
sis). The specific formula depends on the type of hypoth-
esis test being conducted. For example, in a t-test, the
formula for the test statistic involves the sample mean,
population mean (as stated in the null hypothesis), sam-
ple standard deviation, and sample size.

For example: t = (X - p) / SE where SE is based on standard
deviation (0) that is calculated with formula SE = SE=o/ in

¢ The test statistics can be t-statistic, z-statistic, chi-
square statistic etc. We have discussed parametric and
non-parametric tests also.

Step 5: ComPaRING THE TEST STATISTICAL VALUES

Now is the time to compare the test statistic calculated in

step 4 to the critical values from a statistical table.

We may calculate p-value. Let us recall that the signifi-

cance of the p-value that measures the strength of evi-

dence (observed data or sample data) against the null

hypothesis. This determines the statistical significance of

your results.

* Avery low value, that is less than or equal to 5% (or .005

in 1) indicates that observed data is very unlikely under
the null hypothesis. That indicates level of significance.

¢ A high p-value indicates that the observed data is
more likely under the null hypothesis, suggesting no
significant effect or difference.

Step 6: INTERPRETING THE RESULTS

The interpretation of the test statistic’s relationship to criti-
cal values or the p-value leads to-a decision about whether
to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. This decision is
based on whether the test statistic falls in a critical region
(reject H,) or not (do not reject H,). We need to look at the
diagram for better idea.

(J Power of the Test

The power of a statistical test is the probability of cor-
rectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. Power
is influenced by factors such as sample size, effect size,
and the chosen significance level.

BBA Practical Question

Some leraners may go for one practical question to verify
what has been discussed. The same steps have been fol-
lowed in this question.

To perform a two-tailed hypothesis test based on the
given information, we will test whether the mean perfor-
mance of students who take online classes is significantly
different from the population parameter.

« Sample size (n): 40 students.

* Sample mean (x): 86.

* Population parameter (1): 80.

* Sample standard deviation (6): 5.
* Significance level (a): 0.05.

Step 1: FORMULATE THE NuLL anpD ALTERNATIVE
HYPOTHESES
* Null Hypothesis (H,): The mean performance of stu-
dents who take online classes is not significantly dif-
ferent from the population parameter, which is 80.
H,: p = 80

Research Aptitude

- Alternative Hypothesis (H,): The mean perfor-
mance of students who take online classes‘ is signifi-
cantly different (either higher or lower) from the
population parameter of 80.

H,: p # 80

Step 2: SET THE SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL (a)
This sets the threshold for making a decision about the
null hypothesis.

e Significance level («) is given as 0.05.

Step 3: CoLttect SAMPLE Data

¢ Arandom sample of 40 students is collected from the
population.

Step 4: CaLcuLaTE THE TEST STATISTIC

We repeat here that the test statistic is calculated based
on the sample data and, in some cases, the population
parameter or its hypothesized value as stated in the null
hypothesis.

2.33

e Calculate the standard error of the mean (SE): SE
=o0/inSE =5/140 SE = 0.7906 (rounded to four
decimal places)

¢ Calculate the t-statistic using the formula: t = (x -
LW) / SE
t = (86 - 80) / 0.7906 t = 7.5871 (rounded to four
decimal places)

¢ SEis almost similar to standard deviation.

Step 5: ComPaRE THE TEST STATISTIC AND
CrITICAL VALUES

This step determines whether the test statistic falls in the
rejection region.

° Degrees of freedom (d,) = n- 1 = 40-1 = 39, (this
step may be ignored also).

e Using a t-table or calculator at 0/2 = 0.025 (for each
tail) and df = 39, find the critical t-values.

¢ The critical t-values for a two-tailed test at « = 0.05
are approximately +2.021 (rounded to three decimal
places).

¢« Compare the calculated t-statistic (7.5871) to the
critical t-values (-2.021 and 2.021).

Step 6: INTERPRET THE RESULTS

Here, the decision to either reject or fail to reject the null
hypothesis is made, and the significance of this decision
is explained.

* Since |7.5871| > 2.021, the test statistic falls in the
rejection region.

* Determine the p-value associated with the calculated
t-statistic (p < a).

* In this case, both conditions are met: |7.5871| >
2.021, and the p-value is very close to 0, which is less
than 0.05 (a).

* Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.

CoNcLUSION

We reject the null hypothesis, which means there is
strong evidence to conclude that the mean performance
of students who take online classes is significantly differ-
ent (either higher or lower) from the population param-
eter of 80.

This solution fits into the six steps of hypothesis testing
and provides a clear interpretation of the results.

Directional versus Non-Directional Tests

Imagine we are testing a new drug’s effect on lowering
blood pressure. We may have two options:

1. Directional Test: We are specifically looking at
whether the drug increases blood pressure. This
is like a detective with a hunch, only exploring one
direction.

2. Non-Directional Test: We are open to any changes,
whether the drug increases or decreases blood pres-
sure, It’s like a detective who checks all possibilities.

Sampling Errors: Types and Meaning

When dealing with samples as in the six steps, some errors
can come into picture. We are taking help of sample to test
population parameter, so some errors can’t be avoided.
Here are two important types:

1. Type I Error (False Positive, «): In this context, a
Type I error would occur if researchers incorrectly
reject the null hypothesis (H,) when it is, in fact, true.

Example: In other words, they would conclude that
the new online teaching method either increases or
decreases students’ marks when, in reality, it has no
significant effect on their performance.

We know that Significance level’ a)’ is usually set at
1%, 5%, or 10%. An @ of 0.05 means a 5% chance of
seeing an effect when there’s none.

2. Type II Error (False Negative, B): In the same con-
text, a Type II error would occur if researchers fail
to reject the null hypothesis (H,) when it is, in fact,
false. In this scenario, they would conclude that the
new online teaching method has no significant effect
on students’ marks, when, in reality, it does have a sig-
nificant impact on their performance. In essence, they
miss detecting a real effect that exists.B is researcher's
‘missed opportunity,’

Errors can also be categorized as:

1. Sampling Errors: These happen when collecting the
sample itself, making it less accurate.

2. Random Sampling Errors: These occur due to
chance in selecting a random sample. They aim for
objectivity.

3. Non-Sampling Errors: These errors aren’t related to
selecting a sample and can even pop up in a census.

Sample Size Significane

Depending on the number of samples, you choose
between:

1. Small Sample Test (e.g., Student’s t-test): When
you have less than 30 samples.

2. Large Sample Test (e.g., z-test): When you have
more than 30 samples. The formulas change here.

Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Tests

1. Parametric Tests: These assume something about
’ the population (like assuming the average blood
pressure is 80). They work well for normal data.
Examples include t-tests, ANOVA, and correlation
coefficients.

2. Non-Parametric Tests: These don’t assume much
about the population. They’re more flexible and can
handle non-normal data. Chi-square tests, Mann-
Whitney tests, and Spearman Rank Correlation are
non-parametric examples. They're great for qualita-
tive research studies.

Skewness in Distributions

Skewness is a concept that helps us understand how a dis-
tribution’s shape differs from the ideal ‘normal distribu-
tion,’ which is perfectly symmetrical.

In simple terms:

* Skewness measures the lack of symmetry in a dataset.

* A perfectly symmetrical distribution has a skewness
of zero.

* Positive skewness means the data is skewed to the
right (mean > mode).

Research Aptitude

* Negative skewness means the data is skewed to the
left (mean < mode).

Thus, we can say that skewness isa valuable tool for detect-
ing any deviations from a perfectly balanced distribution.

Understanding Kurtosis: Tail Shape

Kurtosis, unlike skewness, zeros in on the shape of a dis-
tribution’s tails. It measures how different the tails of a
distribution are from those of a normal distribution.

Here is the essence:

* Kurtosis is all about tail shape.

* It’s the fourth standardized central moment and is
always positive.

* Kurtosis values can vary from 1 to +.

* Anormal distribution has a kurtosis of 3.

Kurtosis helps us assess how much a distribution’s tails
deviate from the norm.
Kurtosis presents itself in three distinct situations:

Leptokurtic
\.4-—~ Distribution
\ Mesokurtic
A Distribution
\

Platykurtic
Distribution

1. Platykurtic: If K < 3, the distribution is referred to
as platykurtic. This condition is characterized by less
pronounced ‘peakedness’ and relatively weaker ‘tails.’

2. Leptokurtic: When K > 3, the distribution is termed
leptokurtic. In this scenario, the distribution exhibits
greater ‘peakedness’ and heavier ‘tails.’

3. Mesokurtic: When K = 3, the distribution is known
as mesokurtic, representing a moderate level of both
peak height and breadth.


l§ Research Ethics

Ethics are guiding principles that uphold our values.
While laws are society’s formal regulations, ethics tend
to be broader and less formal. An action can be legal but
unethical, or illegal but ethical. Ethics serve two key pur-
poses: they provide guidance on how to act in various
situations and offer strong reasons for doing so.

EMERGENCE FROM VALUE CONFLICTS

Ethics often arise from conflicts between values, and
research ethics are no exception. In research, these con-



=== Page 48 ===
2.36

flicts take various forms, such as privacy vs. justification
for manipulation, openness vs. confidentiality, and pre-
sent loss vs. future benefits, Each research decision may
involve a compromise between values. Researchers aim to
minimize risks while optimizing the quality of outcomes.

Benefits of Ethical Research
Observing ethics in research offers several benefits:

J. Truth and Error Avoidance: Promotes research goals
such as uncovering truth and minimizing errors.
2. Collaborative Values: Encourages collaborative

values like trust, accountability, mutual respect, and
fairness.

3. Public Accountability: Holds researchers account-
able to the public and society.

4. Participant Engagement: Builds public support
for research, making it easier to recruit willing
participants.

Main Approaches to Research Ethics
Three primary approaches to ethics:

1. Deontological Approach: Advocates using a univer-
sal code for ethical decisions, based on absolutes.

2. Ethical Scepticism Approach: Suggests ethical stan-
dards are relative to one’s culture and time, rooted in
relativism.

3. Utilitarianism Approach: Modern version of ‘the
end justifies the means.’ Decisions based on cost-ben-
efit analysis. Qualitative issues like potential harm to
human or animal life also considered.

Desirable Ethical Elements in Research
General ethical guidelines include:

Stakeholders in Research

Three key stakeholders in research are participants,
researchers, and funding organizations.

Ethical Issues Relating to Participants

1. Avoiding Harm: Researchers must not harm par-
ticipants, inspired by past unethical cases (e.g., Nazi
experiments).

2. Psychological Distress: Emotional harm, loss of
self-esteem, and hampering development should be
avoided.

3. Confidentiality: Protecting participants’ identity and
data is essential.

4. Privacy: Invasive questions about income, age, etc.,
should be approached with caution.

5. Informed Consent: Participants must willingly pro-
vide informed consent.

6. Minimizing Harm: Researchers must minimize risk
to participants, ensuring the benefits outweigh poten-
tial harm.

Ethical Issues Relating to Researchers

1. Avoiding Bias: Researchers must maintain objectiv-
ity to avoid bias.

2. Treatment Provision: Providing unproven treat-
ments poses ethical dilemmas, with informed consent
and minimal risk considerations.

3. Methodology: Using biased samples or procedures is
unethical.

4. Incorrect Reporting: Misrepresenting data is
unethical.

5. Information Use: Researchers must balance ben-
efits to the organization against potential harm to
individuals.

Key Ethical Terms

1. Fabrication: Creating spurious data, unethical and
undermines research integrity.

2. Falsification: Manipulating data, equipment, or pro-
cesses to misrepresent research.

3. Plagiarism: Appropriating others’ work as one’s own,
illegal and unethical.

4, Multiple Authorship: Ethical issues include improper
assignment of credit and exclusion of contributors.

Peer Review Ethics

Confidentiality and protection of intellectual property are
vital in the peer review process. Neither reviewers nor
authors should know each other’s identities.

Duplicate and Partial Publication

Publishing the same data or results multiple times is
unethical. Partial publication may be acceptable for large
studies with different research questions and data

Articles, Workshop, Seminar,
Conference, And Symposium _

The whole of science is nothing more than a
refinement of everyday thinking,
\ — Albert Einstein

ARTICLE OR JOURNAL ARTICLE

Since we are discussing articles within research, an
article is also to be discussed in the manner of research
only. This topic can be divided into research article and
review paper.

A research article is based on original research. The
kind of research varies depending upon the field or the
topic (experiments, survey, interview, questionnaire, etc.).
Here, the authors need to collect and analyze raw data
and conduct an original study. The research paper will be
based on the analysis and interpretation of these data.

The various steps followed to show the process have
been given as:

1. Conducting research
2. Manuscript writing
3. Journal selection

esearch Aptitude

4, Journal submission

5, Manuscript tracking
6. Peer review

7, Manuscript rejection
g. Post publication

A review article or review paper summarizes the findings
of existing literature. So, the readers can develop an idea
about the existing knowledge on a topic without having to
read all the published works in the field. It does not report
original research. Review articles generally summarize
the existing literature on a topic in an attempt to explain
the current state of understanding on the topic. Review
articles can be of three kinds.

1. Narrative Review: It explains the existing knowledge
on a topic based on all the published research avail-
able on the topic.

2. Systematic Review: It searches for the answer to a
particular question in the existing scientific literature
on a topic.

3. Meta-analysis: It compares and combines the findings
of previously published studies, usually to assess the
effectiveness of an intervention or mode of treatment.

Most reputed journals publish review articles. If published
in a good peer-reviewed journal, the review articles often
have a high impact and receive a lot of citations.

Difference Between a Thesis and an Article

A researcher is always under pressure to publish, where
one good way to do this is to convert doctoral thesis into a
journal article, during or after Ph.D. It is essential to know
how a thesis differs from a journal article. Here are some
of the elements that you will need to work on to success-
fully create a journal article from your thesis.

MEETING

A meeting is an assembly or coming together of people,
be it a symposium, workshop, conference or so. In a very
remote sort of a way, all of them convey the same mean-
ing, i.e., people coming together for a purpose.

Sympostum

It is usually a formal meeting in which specialists deliver
short addresses on a topic or on related topics and then
answer the questions relating to these topics. It is espe-
cially one in which the participants form an audience and
make presentations.

A symposium is also defined as a collection of writings
on a particular topic, as in a magazine. °

CoLLoaquium

It is usually an academic meeting in which specialists
deliver addresses on a topic or on related topics and then
answer the questions relating to these topics. A colloquium
is targeted to a well-educated but not specialized audience.

CONFERENCE

A conference is a meeting of people who confer about a
topic. It is a meeting where people come for discussion.

It features keynotes and presentations delivered to
all attendees, as well as multiple break-out sessions.
Attendees expect to receive information about industry
trends and developments.

It can be an academic conference (a formal event
where researchers present results), a business confer-
ence (organized to discuss business-related matters),
or a parent-teacher conference (meeting with a child’s
teacher to discuss grades and school performance), a
peace conference (a diplomatic meeting to end conflict)
and so on.

Wesinars orn Wes CoNrERENCES

Webinars or web conferences are presentations that
involve an audio and video component. The audio portion
of the event is delivered via phone or over the internet, so
that participants can listen via their computer speakers.
The video portion of the event is delivered via the inter-
net, giving participants a presentation to watch while lis-
tening to the instructor.

SEMINAR

The word seminar is derived from the Latin word semi-
narium, meaning seed plot. It is a formal presentation by
one or more experts to a small group of audience. It can be
conducted on recurring or regular basis, monthly or even
weekly. There is an invited speaker, and the audience is
much more technically versed or specific in nature.

The motive behind the seminar system is to familiarize
students extensively with vital aspects of their study and
allow them to interact with examples of practical prob-
lems that always occur during study or research work.
Thus, a seminar is a form of academic instruction either
at an academic institution or offered by a commercial or
professional organization.

Seminars focus on some particular subject in which
everyone present is requested to actively participate.

Colloquia and seminars both happen in an academic
setting. Phenomena such as global warming and climate
change and nuclear power accidents are discussed but
from the perspective of a scientist. However, a well-edu-
cated audience is able to understand it.

___ Egy

Teleseminars are seminars delivered via a conference
call over the telephone and/or through the internet.

WorksHops

Workshops tend to be smaller and more intense than
seminars. This format involves students practising their
new skills during the event under the watchful eye of an
instructor.

Hands-on workshops typically involve participants
doing work on a particular issue during the program.
The promise is that when they leave, they will have
at least a rough plan or tools in place to address the
challenge.

Impact Factor

The impact factor of an academic journal is a meas-
ure reflecting the average number of citations to recent
articles published in the journal. It reflects the relative
importance of a journal within its field. Journals with
higher impact factors are deemed to be more important
than those with lower ones.

The h-index is an index that attempts to measure both
the productivity and the impact of the published work of
a scientist or a scholar.

The g-index is like the h-index, and it has an averaged
citation count.

The i10-index indicates the number of academic
publications an author has written that has at least ten
citations from others. It was introduced in July 2011 by
Google as part of their work on Google Scholar, a search
engine dedicated to academic and related papers.

Introduction to Comprehension
‘Passages

According to Wren and Martin, a comprehension test
requires specific reading skills, the ability to grasp the
main ideas from the passage, linking them, inferring, and
drawing conclusions based on a proper understanding of
the passage,

In simpler terms, ‘reading comprehension is the act of
understanding what you are reading.’

As per Joseph Addison ‘Reading is to the mind what
exercise is to the body.’ Just as exercise keeps the body fit,
reading comprehension exercises keep the mind sharp.
This comprehension unit should be attempted with a
motivation for the following reasons.

1. Subjective Knowledge is Essential for a Teacher:
Subjective knowledge is a part and parcel in the life of
a teacher, otherwise what will they discuss in the class.
This becomes a question of self esteem. A teacher’s
deep understanding of complex topics is critical. This
knowledge, particularly in reading comprehension,
allows them to make abstract ideas concrete and relat.
able, justifying its inclusion in the Paper 1 curriculum.

2. Goal of Fostering Good Citizenship for Self and
Students: Teachers aim to instill good citizenship in
students, thus, focusing on developing responsibility
and community engagement. This is a key objective
regardless of the subject matter.

3, Diverse Learning Sources for Students: Students
are encouraged to expand their knowledge through
classroom learning, social media platforms like
YouTube, and regular reading of newspapers, maga-
zines. Exposure to a variety of topics such as environ-
ment, politics, geopolitics, environment, economics,
social, culture, tradition, history is crucial. The stu-
dents can developing critical thinking through media
such as Rajya Sabha TV. The students need to become
empathetic global citizens in a democratic nation.

Main Components of ComPREHENSION PASSAGES
Reading Comprehension means to explore the ideas, that
mainly requires two inputs from the reader - vocabulary
knowledge and text comprehension for a piece of writing,

According to Ludwig Wittgenstein, ‘The limits of my
language mean the limits of my world.’ Vocabulary is the
gateway to understanding the world of literature and
knowledge.

According to Karin Slaughter, ‘Reading is not just an
escape. It is access to a better way of life.’ We can have
deeper assessment of life’s complexities.

‘Identification of Key Ideas, ‘Summarize the Paragraph,’
‘Determine Sentence Links,’ and ‘Ask Questions’ are tech-
niques to enhance comprehension.

How to get into the passage - according to Mortimer
J. Adler, comprehension is akin to the art of discovery
which requires the skills of keenness of observation, read-
ily available memory, range of imagination, and a reason
trained to judge the value of evidence.

Main Question Catecorices

To organize the discussion of comprehension passage
question categories in a systematic, concise manner while
retaining all the essential points:

Main Theme or Central Idea: Questions focusing on
the passage’s overall message and the author’s purpose,
They assess the reader’s ability to understand the entire
paragraph. We need to pay attention to following words
to get an idea about the theme of a passage in an innova-
tive manner:

1, Cause and effect words—as a result, therefore
2. Time words—meanwhile, before

3. Contrast words—in contrast, conversely

4, Addition words—also, in addition

5, Emphasis words—more important, remember

+ Approach: Look to the introductory or concluding
paragraphs for answers.

¢ Examples: Identifying the passage’s best narration or
the sentence reflecting the main idea.

AuTHor’s OPINION AND ATTITUDE

These questions delve into the author’s viewpoint, these
can be inferred from the content, style, and phraseology.

¢ Approach: Analyze the writing style and tone,
focusing on adverbs and adjectives that indicate the
author’s mood and intensity.

¢ Examples: Determining the author’s tone, logical
solutions, or ideas they agree with.

Exp.icit oR Direct INFORMATION

Direct questions about specific details like names, dates,
and facts.

e Approach: A student should learn to scan for key-
words and read specific parts of the passage contain-
ing the answer. This is an era of ‘information overload’
so developing such habit is important. Pay attention
to negative-specific details.

e Examples: Questions about true statements or out-
dated motivations according to the passage,

IMPLiciT INFORMATION

Questions where the answers are implied rather than
explicitly stated.

e Approach: Understand the overall idea and the
author’s arguments.

e Examples: Inferring from the passage or identifying
arguments the author is likely to agree with.

LanGuaGce Expression Questions

We need to focus on specific words or phrases and their
contextual meanings.

¢ Approach: A thorough second reading of the relevant
part for better context u nderstanding.

¢ Examples: Interpreting specific phrases or finding
synhonyms/antonyms in context.

ORGANIZATION OF THE PASSAGE

There may be questions about the passage’s structure and
the author’s literary techniques.
¢ Approach: Improve literary skills through extensive
reading. '
e Examples: Identifying the passage’s structure, the
author’s fundamental premise, or assumptions.

ANALOGOUS ARGUMENT QUESTIONS

These questions require selecting an option that aligns
with the reasoning or arguments in the passage.
¢ Objective: To test comprehension and the ability to
form an analysis based on the passage. It assesses the
capability to link two different examples following the
same reasoning.
¢ Solution Approach: Understand the core arguments
in the passage first. Then, compare each option to the
passage’s reasoning to find the best match.
e Examples:
e Identifying an illustration that best represents
arguments in a specific paragraph.
¢ Applying a given phrase, like ‘to err is human,
to the most suitable situation from the options
listed.
Thus, we can see from the above discussion that read-
ing comprehension isn’t just about consuming words; it’s
about digesting and understanding their deeper meanings.

ir Specimen Passage 1

In the heart of India’s cultural heritage lies yoga, a prac-
tice rooted in the Vedas, dating back over 5,000 years.
This ancient art, transcending its origins, has become a
global phenomenon, offering a holistic path to well-being.
Beyond physical exercise, yoga harmonizes mind, body,
and spirit, fostering unity, balance, self-awareness, and
mindfulness. It connects individuals deeply with them-
selves and the universe, marking a journey of internal and
external harmony. :

Yoga’s transformative nature extends beyond physical
health to mental and spiritual growth. It instills peace,

Read the following passage and answer the questions.

Saving energy means saving money. Homeowners and
renters know this basic fact but they often don’t know
what kinds of adjustments they can make in their homes
and apartments that will result in savings.

For those willing to spend some time and money to
reap long-term energy savings, an energy audit is the
way to go. An energy auditor will come into your home
and assess its energy efficiency. The auditor will pinpoint
areas of your home that use the most energy and offer
solutions to lower your energy use and costs. Trained
energy auditors know what to look for and can locate
a variety of flaws that may be resulting in energy inef-
ficiency, including inadequate insulation, construction
flaws, and uneven heat distribution.

There are quicker and less costly measures that can be
taken as well. One way to save money is to replace incan-
descent lights with fluorescents. This can result in a sav-
ings of more than 50% on your monthly lighting costs
When it’s time to replace old appliances, it’s wise to spend
a bit more for an energy-efficient model, and be sure
that you are taking advantage of energy saving settings
already on your current refrigerator, dishwasher, washing
machine, or dryer.

Windows provide another opportunity to cut your
energy costs. Caulk old windows that might be leaky to
prevent drafts, and choose double-paned windows if
youre building an addition or replacing old windows.

Most areas of your home or apartment offer opportuni-
ties to save energy and money. The results are significant
and are well worth the effort. [December 2023]

Read the following passage and answer the questions.
Coral reefs are the most biologically diverse ecosystems
of the ocean. As divers know, thousands of beautiful fish,
molluscs and urchins are among the amazing marine life
that live among coral reefs. In fact, the corals themselves
are also marine animals.

Almost a thousand coral species currently exist in fan-
tastic shapes ranging from mushrooms to moose antlers,
cabbages, tabletops, wire strands and fluted pillars. With
the majority of humankind living in coastal regions, many
people depend on living coral reefs for food and protec-
tion from storms and erosion, as well as the additional
benefits of medical research, tourism and natural beauty.
