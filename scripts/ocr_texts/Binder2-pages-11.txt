jndian Institutes of Management (HM)

the JIMs are a group of 20 public, autonomous institutes of

management education and research in India. They primar-

jy offer postgraduate, doctoral and executive education
rogrammes. The establishment of IIMs was initiated by

on the recommendation of the Planning Commission.
The following is the list of the first six IIMs:

e JIM Calcutta (with support from the MIT Sloan Insti-
tute of Management)—1961

e IIM Ahmedabad (with support from the Harvard

Business School)—1961

IIM Bengaluru-—-1973

IIM Lucknow—1984

IIM Kozhikode—1996

* JIM Indore—1996

In the second and third generations of IIMs, six insti-
tutes each were opened.

As we discussed, they have been set up under different
acts of the Parliament. The Lok Sabha passed the IIM Bill
2017 to make IIMs the INI. It allows IIMs greater autonomy
and empowers them to grant degrees instead of diplomas.

on the pattern of the IISc at Kolkata, Pune, Mohali,
Bhopal and Thiruvananthapuram.

National Institutes of Technology

° On the recommendations of the erstwhile Planning
Commission in 1955, eight Regional Engineering Col-

were set up in early 1960s.
° Gradually, the number of colleges were increased to 17.
° In 2003, RECs were rechristened as NITs and taken
over as fully funded institutes of the central govern-
ment. They were granted a deemed university status.

Value education is an integral part of the educational
framework, aimed at the holistic development of individ-
uals and society. Here’s a summary of key developments
and perspectives in value education in India:
¢ Broader Aim of Value Education:
1. Individual’s Perspective: Achieving personal
fulfillment and success in life and work.
2. Societal Perspective: Preparing youth to con-
tribute positively to society, the nation, and the
world.

° Historical Perspective: Plato’s view in ‘The Republie

highlights the role of educated individuals in using
their knowledge to solve societal problems.

THe Neep ror Vatue Epucation

The need for imparting value education arises from sey.
eral contemporary issues and societal changes. Here are
the main issues:

1.

Tradition versus Modernity: We need to strike a bal.
ance between traditional values and modernization.
Value education helps young learners appreciate posj-
tive aspects of tradition, such as tolerance, harmony,
and collectivism, while also embracing beneficia]
aspects of modernization.

. Globalization: With societies becoming increasingly

multicultural, individuals must learn to navigate a
complex and diverse global environment. Value edu-
cation can help in understanding and respecting dif-
ferent cultures.

. Diversity: Balancing universality and diversity, is a

challenge in a democratic and diverse society. Value
education promotes respect and understanding of
various cultural, social, and religious backgrounds.

. Inclusivity: A healthy society is inclusive, making all

members feel valued and involved. Value education
fosters a sense of belonging and acceptance among
individuals.

. Environmental Concerns: Issues like global warm-.

ing, pollution, deforestation, and soil erosion high-
light the need for environmental consciousness.
Value education emphasizes the ethical responsibility
towards sustainable environmental practices.

. Explosion of Science and Technology: The ethical

use of science and technology is critical. Value educa-
tion addresses the moral and ethical responsibilities
associated with the application of scientific and tech-
nological advancements.

. Impact of Mass and Social Media: The pervasive -

influence of media in daily life often transmits values
and attitudes contrary to those upheld by families,
schools, and society. Value education helps individu-
als critically evaluate media content and its impact on
values and behaviour.

Key DEVELOPMENTS IN VALUE EDUCATION

1.

National Commission of Secondary Education
(1952-53): Emphasized character building as the
primary goal of education.

. University Education Commission (1962):.

Highlighted the importance of spiritual training in
educational institutions.

. Education Commission (1964-66): Focused on

education for national development and recom-
mended direct moral instruction in schools.

. National Policy on Education (NPE, 1986):

Advocated using education as a tool for cultivat-
ing social and moral values, emphasizing unity and
integration.



=== Page 3 ===
5. NPE - Programme of Action (1992): Aimed to ~

integrate value education components into the cur-

riculum at all school stages, including secondary

education.

6. Chavan’s Committee Report (1999): Gave impetus
to focus on the value orientation of education.

7, National Curriculum Framework for School
Education (2000): Made a plea to integrate value
education into the curriculum.

8. National Curriculum Framework (2005): Reaf-

firmed commitment to equality, diversity, and mutual

interdependence, emphasizing education for peace as

a crucial national and global concern.

These developments reflect the evolving understand-
ing and incorporation of value education in India’s edu-
cational system, recognizing its importance in shaping
responsible, ethical, and socially conscious individuals.

in areas like research, reputation, and faculty quality as

discussed above also. Thus, governance does matter.
Governance marks a shift from traditional government

paradigms, indicating a new process or method of govern-

-ing, or a transformed state of structured ruling. It involves

the various ways society is managed and organized.

Diverse INTERPRETATIONS OF GOVERNANCE

* Minimal State: Refers to a governance model where
the state plays a limited role, intervening only when
necessary.

* Corporate Governance: Involves the structures and
processes for the direction and control of companies.

° New Public Management: A perspective that empha-
sizes efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in
the public sector.

®* Good Governance: Entails effective, transparent,
accountable, and ethical management in the public
sector.

° International Interdependence: Governance as shaped
by global interdependencies and international relations.

* Socio-Cybernetic System: Viewing governance as a
complex, adaptive system that involves social dynam-
ics and information feedback loops.

° Networks: Governance through collaborative net-
works and decentralized decision-making.

Goop GovERNANCE In Higher EpucaTion

1, Collaborative Governance Framework: Governance
in education brings together UGC, universities, NAAC,
NBA, and key institutions. They work together through
dialogue and partnership. The stated principles are
democratic but then decision making is cumbersome.

2. Principles of Good Governance: This focuses on imple-
menting educational policies effectively and fairly. It is
based on past reforms and the New Education Policy.
The goal is to improve both public life and education.

3. Strategic Restructuring and Collaboration: This
involves reshaping government bodies to focus on
social goals. It also means working together with the
state, private sector, NGOs, and community groups.
The approach uses diverse strategies, like socio-
cybernetic systems and networks.

4. Societal Impact and Development: Good gover-
nance in education is crucial for society’s growth.
It supports a balanced role for the state in making
impactful educational changes and policies.

ORGANIZATIONAL StTrucTURE OF Universimes in INDIA

1. Historical Roots: India has strong roots of education.
Ancient Indian education was influenced by Vedanta,
Buddhism, and Jainism. This era led to India being
known as Jagat Guru’. The government aims to retain
elements of this ancient system in modern education.

2. British Influence: The current university system has
its origins in British colonial rule.

° Early Institutions: There is a big list of establish-
ments such as Calcutta Madrasa (1781), Asiatic
Society of Bengal (1784), Banaras Sanskrit



=== Page 6 ===
10.42

College (1791) among others which were
founded during this period.

° British Parliament’s Role: The Charter Act of
1813 declared Indian education a duty of the state.

e Macaulay’s Minute of 1835: This gave priority to
British-style education in India.

° Establishment of Universities: In 1857, universi-

. ties in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras were estab-

lished, modeled on the University of London. The
University of Allahabad, established in 1887, was
more graduate-focused.

¢ Cultural Colonization: The British used the uni-
versity system as a tool for cultural influence.

Post-Colonial Shift: The Government of India Act of

1935 began the process of ‘Indianisation’ of educa-

tion, transferring more control to provincial govern-

ments and marking the end of British dominance over

the Indian education system.

Post-INDEPENDENCE DEVELOPMENT IN HIGHER
EDUCATION IN INDIA

1.

Continuity and Change: The shift in higher educa-
tion after independence continued from the pre-inde-
pendence era. Initially, higher education was primar-
ily for the elite, but post-independence goals aimed to
make it accessible to the wider Indian public.

: Expansion and Inclusion:

Numerous new universities were established to
expand educational opportunities.

* Diverse courses and professional studies were
introduced, leading to the establishment of pre-
mier institutions like IITs, BITS-Pilani, regional
engineering colleges, and IIMs.

e National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian
Institutes of Science (IISc), and Indian Institutes
of Science Education and Research (IISERs) were
developed.

Focus on Languages and Humanities: These fields

gained prominence up until the 1980s.

Further Growth in the 1990s and 2000s:

° This period saw the establishment of new IITs and
IIMs.

° Despite this expansion, the organizational struc-
ture of universities, largely based on the principle
of affiliation, remained largely unchanged.

Governance and Administrative Bodies:

° Most Indian universities maintained an affiliation
system, aiming for efficient governance of con-
stituent and affiliated colleges.

° Statutory bodies were established to govern these
institutions.

Types of Universities:

The Indian higher education system comprises
mainly two types of universities:

® Unitary universities: focus on teaching and
research within a single campus.

° Affiliating universities: They have a central cam-

pus for postgraduate instruction and research, with
several affiliated colleges spread across districts

FUNDING AND Types OF COLLEGES IN INDIAN
Hicguer Epucation System
1. University Funding:

e Most Indian universities receive funding from
Central or State governments.

° Some deemed universities are sponsored by pri.
vate trusts, like Birla Institute of Technology ang
Science, Pilani, and Thapar University, Patiala,

° Private universities, set up under Acts of ©
Legislatures, include Sikkim- Manipal University
and Amity University in Chattisgarh.

2. Colleges and Their Types:

A significant portion of undergraduate teaching

occurs in colleges.

e Colleges are categorized as:

(i) Constituent Colleges: Established and man-
aged directly by the university.

(ii) Affiliated Colleges: Set up and managed
outside the university, often by the govern-
ment or educational trusts, with affiliation
granted by the universities in consultation
with the government.

3. Sources of University Funding: University income in

India comes from the following.
° Central Government grants.
° State Government grants.
® Student fees.
¢ Endowments.and donations.
¢ Support from specialized agencies.

4. Types of Grants:

e State government grants to universities are
divided into:

(i) Maintenance/Block Grants: For routine
operations, including salaries. They are
adjusted periodically based on cost changes.

(ii) Non-recurring Grants: Used for infra-
structural needs like buildings and equip-
ment. Land is usually provided by the State
government.

(iii) Development Grants: For new schemes,
often matched by the university for vari-
ous activities, especially those sponsored by
federal/state governments and channelled
through the UGC.

e Central government provides grants for general
and developmental purposes through the UGC.
When states become responsible for grants,
financial challenges may arise.

funding agency of the UN with 193 member states, that
was created in 1967. This deals with Intellectual Property
Rights (IPR), innovation and creativity. The governance is
also defined in the WIPO Convention.

The following information was published in September,
2023 by WIPO:

The Five Top Nations in 2023: Switzerland, Sweden,
USA, UK and Singapore. This is the 1st time entry of
Singapore into the top five list. This nation is now the
leader in the South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania
(SEAO) region.

The Rank of India: India is positioned 40th out of 132
Nations. That ranking was 81st in 2015. The improve-
ment in GII is attributed to its rich knowledge capital, a
vibrant startup ecosystem, and contributions from pub-
lic and private research organizations. Our response
to Covid-19 pandemic and its commitment to the Atma
Nirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India) were innovative.

Science and Technology Clusters (S & T Clusters):
The most significant S&T clusters are Tokyo-Yokohama,
Shenzhen—Hong Kong~Guangzhou, Seoul, Beijing, and
Shanghai-Suzhou. The rank of China was 21st and USA
was 21, thus China surpassed USA.

India has only four S&T clusters in the top 100 (Chennai,
Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi), compared to China’s 24
and the USA’s 21.

Role of NITI Aayog: NITI is working to promote innova-
tion in key sectors like electric vehicles, biotechnology,
nanotechnology, space, and alternative energy sources.

Read the following passage carefully and answer
the following questions:

China does not have free elections. It has reality tel-
evision instead. The latest such show even has the
flavour of a political contest: the competitors are all
high-ranking officials. It has been a big hit.

Since May the programme ‘Sights of Shanxi’ has
been airing live every Friday on a channel in the north-
ern province of that time. In the show, local cities bid
to play host to a tourism development conference.
The contestants have to tell four judges why there
city is such a great place, in front of a studio audi-
ence of 100 people and a panel of experts. The judges
grill the contestants who advance or fall according to
votes cast by the audience in the studio, the judges,
and internet users.

What makes this special is that for the first time
local bigwigs are not just speaking in public, which
is rare enough, but competing against one another
and being judged by ordinary folk, which is unheard
of, One tourism official from Shanxi told a newspa-
per that ‘in the past all we had to do was hand ina
report, but because it is on TV, the process now had
to be taken more seriously.’

Top officials have to be involved. Of the eleven con-
testants, three are municipal communist party bosses,
five are city mayors, and three are vice mayors.

For most of them, it has been their first experience
to live cameras. They have taken to it like natural. The
mayor of Yangquan city learnt a bit of English to spice
up his bid. ‘Seeing is believing’, he said. ‘The open and
inclusive Yangquan people welcome you to come.’
The party chief of Yucheng suffered a slipped disc,
but soldiered on, rehearsing her speech flat on her
back. The Deputy Mayor of Linfen handed out virtual
reality glasses to the judges as part of his pitch and it
worked, he won his round.

Viewers love seeing judges take officials to task,
‘you would do better to tell us just one or two things
instead of so many that we forget them’ said one
judge. ‘What did you mean by your slogan?’ asked
another. ‘TT did not get it.’

So far 8.3 million people have voted online. The
government itself is partly responsible for the show’s
success and has good reason to be encouraging the
people. Shanxi’s economy has been struggling;
tourism is its favoured way of diversifying away
from its traditional coal mining business. In other
words, appealing to an audience actually helps its
broader aims. Perhaps, the idea will catch on and

some reality hosts will, one day, make the great leg

(a): Alex Osborn developed the original approach
of brainstorming. He published it in his 1953 book,
‘Applied Imagination.’ Since then, researchers have
made many improvements to his original technique.
Brainstorming combines a relaxed, informal approach
to problem solving with lateral thinking. It encour-
ages people to come up with thoughts and ideas that
can, at first, seem a bit crazy. Some of these ideas can
be crafted into original, creative solutions to a prob-
lem, while others can spark even more ideas.

. (c): Biasedness is associated with sampling and non-

sampling errors.

. (b): These skills are generalized ones.
. (c): The final results depend upon the analysis of data

that depends upon the quality of sampling. For accu-
racy of results, samples should be representative of
population.

(c): Cybernetics is closely related to the concept of
utomatic control and also with physiology, particu-

larly the physiology of the nervous system. A ‘control-

ler’ might be the human brain, which receives signals

from a ‘monitor’ (the eyes) regarding the distance

between a reaching hand and an object to be picked

up. The information sent by the monitor to the con-

troller is called feedback, and on the basis of this feed-

back the controller might issue instructions to bring

the observed behaviour (the reaching of the hand)

closer to the desired behaviour (the picking up of

the object). It is used in computer sciences and other

areas as well.

(c): 139-4=135

135-7 (=4+4+ 3) = 128

128-12 (=7 + 5) = 116

116-19 (=12 +7) = 97

97 —- 28 (=19+9) = 69

(a):

Assume that desired ratio is 2x, 3x, and 7x.

According to question:

7x — (2x + 3x) = % 1500

Thus, x = % 750 and share of P = 2 x 750 =% 1500

24.

Therefore, Q is aunt of S. :

(c): Required percentage = (10/110) x 100 = 100/11
= 9.09 per cent

(d): ;

First statement is particular negative (O-Type)
Second Statement is Universal Affirmative (A~Type)
Third Statement is Particular Affirmative (I-Type)
Now,

All red are raw

a

Some raw are mangoes
A +1=No conclusion
So (d) is the right answer.
(b): We need to take help of ‘Square of opposition’.
As per definition in question statement, we need to
look at ‘contrary statements’, which should be univer-
sal positive (A) and universal negative (E). Thus, (b) is
the right answer.
(b): Required Ratio = (83 + 108 + 74 + 88 + 98)/(98
+112 + 101+ 133 + 142)
= 451/586 = 1/1.3 = 10/13

(d): Average amount of interest paid by the company
during the given period
= & [(23.4 + 32.5 + 41.6 + 36.4 + 49.4)/5] lakhs.
= € (183.3/5) lakhs = % 36.66 lakhs.
(c): Required percentage
= [(288 + 98 + 3.00 + 23.4 + 83)/(420 + 142 +

3.96 + 49.4 + 98)] x 100 per cent
= (495.4/713.36 xX 100) per cent ~ 69.45 per cent
(c): Required percentage
= [(3.00 + 2.52 + 3.84 + 3.68 + 3.96)/(288 + 342

+324 + 336 + 420)] x 100 per cent.
= (17/1710 x 100) per cent = 1 per cent
(d): ADSL is a type of Digital Subscriber Line technol-
ogy that enables faster data transmission over copper
telephone lines rather than a conventional voiceband
Modem can provide.
(a): Ethanol is blended with petrol that is also called
blended petrol. Ethanol and biodiesel represent the
first generation of biofuel technology.
(a): CFLs, like all fluorescent lamps, contain mercury
as a vapor inside the glass. Mercury (Hg) is a heavy
metal that exists in several forms. Human contact

_ with mercury, in any form, can produce toxic effects

50.

if the dose is high enough.

replaced Planning Commission that was an extra con-
stitutional body that was not defined in the Constitu-
tion of India.
