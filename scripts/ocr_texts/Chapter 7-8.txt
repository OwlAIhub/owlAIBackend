The term ‘environment’ is derived from the French word
‘environner, that means ‘to surround.’ According to the
Environment (Protection) Act of 1986, the environment
encompasses all the physical and biological surround-
ings of an organism and the interactions within them.
It is defined as the collective composition of water, air,
land, and the intricate interconnections that exist among
these elements, as well as with human beings, other living
organisms, and materials.

Environmental Determinism And Possibilism: We
need to understand the following two approaches and
understand the shift from one to another.

* Environmental Determinism: This is the idea that
the physical environment, particularly the climate
and terrain, actively shapes cultures, societies, and
behaviours of individuals. It suggests a strong influ-
ence of the environment on human behaviour and
culture.

¢ Environmental Possibilism: As the name suggests,

this explores the new ‘possibilities’ between humans
and their environment, despite certain environmen-
tal limitations. Through environmental possibilism,
we focus on development with the help of technol-
ogy, innovation, new energy explorations and so on.
Industrialization and urbanization became way of
life. This can be linked with anthropogenic activities
which are to be discussed later.
Thus, balancing of life was required in the form of
sustainable development which we will discuss later.
Right now we are discussing basic concepts of envi-
ronment in the following topics.

Ecology is the scientific study of interactions among
organisms and between organisms and their environ-
ment. Ecology examines how organisms adapt to their
environment, how they interact with other species, and
how they influence and are influenced by the non-living
environment. .

The scope of ecology covers the study of individual
organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems, and
the giobal scale of the biosphere. (Take note that ecosys-
tem is included here).

The concept of ‘ecology’ was coined by Ernst Haeckel, a
German biologist in 1869.

LEVELS oF ECOLOGY
Ecology can be understood at the following levels:
1. Individual Organism: Here, we study a single organ-

ism and its interactions with its environment. It’s
essential to see into where it lives (habitations), how

it adapts to its surroundings (adaptations), and th
potential threats it faces (safety). ?
For instance, let’s take the example of a frog, w,
can examine how it locates food sources, ensures it
safety, and employs protective adaptations in its hab;
tat. We can also investigate how it thrives in a mojg
environment to maintain skin moisture and repro
duces by laying eggs in the water. :

2. Species: A species is a group of similar individu,
organisms that are capable of interbreeding to pro
duce fertile offspring and share common characteris
tics. For example, different species of human beings
roses or trees. The name of species of human beings j
homo sapiens.

Species is a step above the individual organism. They take
us towards population. Their interactions take place a
the following levels:

1. Within species - population ecology

2. Between species - community ecology :

3. Between organisms and their physical environ.
ment - ecosystem ecology

Some Central Role Playing Species: We can discuss the
following:

Keystone Species: Keystone means holding everything
together. Keystone species plays a unique and crucial role.
in the functioning of an ecosystem.

° They are assumed to be essential for the health and
biodiversity of our planet’s ecosystems. They may be
less in number, but their impact on ecosystem is much.
bigger.

° By maintaining balance of nature, they also provide
essential services to other species. Without keystone
species, ecosystems would be much less diverse and
resilient.

° Keystone species function as predators as they con-.
trol the populations of other animals. They actually
function as mutualists for benefits of more than
one species or create or modify habitats for other
species.
For example, in the Sundarbans mangrove forest.
in India, the Indian elephant is a keystone species
because of its large impact on the environment.

° There is an excellent example: ‘Termites’, particu-.
larly in savanna or arid regions, construct large,
complex mounds from soil, saliva, and excrement.
These structures are essential for regulating the
colony’s temperature and humidity which are cru-
cial for survival. Additionally, termite mounds
improve soil quality and water infiltration, which
offer microhabitats for diverse species and thus.
enhancing biodiversity in their ecosystems.

Critical Link Species: This term is broader than that of
keystone species. This includes any species that plays 4
vital role in the functioning of an ecosystem. They play



=== Page 3 ===
al role in connecting different parts of an ecosystem.
may look at the following terms:

cosystem Engineers: They physically alter their
environment.

Foundation Species: They create and define entire
ecosystems, like coral in a coral reef.

Umbrella Species: Conservation of these species pro-
ects a wide range of other species.

ndicator Species: They indicate the health of an
cosystem.
Flagship Species: These are charismatic species used
s a symbol to stimulate conservation awareness and
ction.

emic Species: Endemic species are typically asso-
d with specific geographic regions and are found
rally only in those particular areas. Global exam-
is of endemic are Lion-tailed Macaque in Western
s, Nilgiri Tahr in Nilgiri range (both in India),
kapo (a flightless parrot) in New Zealand, Giant
nda in China are few examples which.are not natu-
ly found anywhere else in the world. Human beings
found almost everywhere and not an example of
demic species.

‘Population: This level deals with groups of the same
species, exploring their dynamics, interactions, and
coexistence in a particular habitat. The following
aspects are crucial for population specially for human
beings.

1. Reproduction and Natality: The production
of new individual organisms from their parents
through this biological process. Natality refers to
the birth rate, or the frequency of births within a
population.

Population Growth Rate: We need to factor
birth and death rates as well as immigration and
emigration.

Age Structure or Distribution with in popula-
tion: Pre-reproductive (too young to reproduce),
reproductive, and post-reproductive (beyond a
age).

Population Dispersal: This takes care of move-
ments - emigration (leaving a region), immigra-
tion (entering a region), and migration (seasonal
or periodic movemient).

Predation: In this interaction one organism, the
predator, kills and eats another organism, its prey.
Mortality: This is the death rate, indicating the
frequency of deaths within a population.
Carrying Capacity: The maximum number of
individuals of a particular species that a specific
environment can sustain indefinitely without
degrading the environment.

Metapopulations: Let’s take an example of deer.
Metapopulations include several deer populations
spread across different forests, connected by migrat-
ing individuals.

9.3

4. Community: This refers to all living things in an area,
how do the different species interact, influence each
other, and maintain the balance of the ecosystem.
Community talks about interdependence, competi-
tion (for space and resources) and disturbances (pol-
lution and intervention by other communities).

For example, in a pond, it is the interaction of frogs, fish,
insects, plants et. Community is an experience that tells
us how do different species interact. The fish might eat
some of the insects, controlling the insect population, and
thus benefits the plants.

Ecological Niche: We discussed some interactions.
Ecological niche refers to the specific role and position
that an organism or species occupies within an ecosystem.
The following aspects are important to us for niches:

Habitat: The area or natural environment in which an
organism or population normally lives is called a habitat.
A habitat is made up of two types of factors:

1. Physical factors such as soil, moisture, temperature
and light

2. Biotic factors such as availability of food and predators

Cohabitat: When organisms of different species live
together.

Microhabitat: When particular organism(s) live in a
small and specific part(s) of a habitat. A habitat is not
always a geographical area.

Example: Frogs are ectothermic as their temperature
is regulated by the environment. They prefer staying in
aquatic and moist terrestrial localities such as freshwa-
ters, wetlands, rainforests etc.

The habitat of human beings is incredibly diverse and
spans the entire planet.

e Resource Utilization: The types of food, shelter, and
other resources etc.

° Behavioural Patterns: This includes feeding habits,
reproduction strategies, routine life patterns.

e Interactions: This refers to relationships with other
species, that includes competition, predation, and
mutualism.

e Tolerance Limits: This refers to range of environ-
mental conditions such as temperature, humidity, pH
etc. that the organism can tolerate,

Ecological Footprint and its Measurement: Though
Earth is assumed like a mother, the give and take rela-
tionship is crucial for sustainability for present and future
generations. The ecological footprint measures how much
nature we use—like food, water, and energy. It checks
whether we use more than Earth can provide. Think of it
as nature’s balance sheet. We should aim to use only what
Earth can give us.

We can use the idea of measuring ecological footprint
for smail things, like how much water is used by a person,
or big things, like the energy used by a whole city, such as



=== Page 4 ===
9.4

Mumbai. We measure ecological footprint in ‘global hect-
ares’ (gha). One global hectare represents what Earth can
renew or regenerate in a year.’

Ecological succession: This is how some ecological (or
ecosystem) slowly change over the time. This happens at
two stages:

1. Primary succession: This begins in places without
life, like rocks, where simple organisms like lichens
start making soil. This allows more plants to grow later.

2. Secondary succession: During this succession, the
ecosystem evolves from simple to more complex com-
munities, eventually reaching a stable state.

Types of Ecology: From a study perspective, ecology has
two branches:

e Autecology: This is the study of ‘individual organ-
isms or a single species’ and their interactions with
the environment. It looks into the life cycle, behav-
iour, adaptations, and how these organisms or species
survive and thrive. This makes us understand the spe-
cific roles and impacts these organisms have within
their ecosystems.

¢ Synecology: This studies how ‘different species in a
community’ interact within their ecosystem. It looks
at how these groups live together, their roles, and
how energy and nutrients flow between them, which
is key for understanding the ecosystem’s overall
functioning.

Haute Ecology: This represents an entirely different per-
spective, Haute Ecology represents a more interdiscipli-
nary and applied approach, blending ecology with other
fields such as design, engineering, and architecture.

Figure 9.1 Main Aspects of Environment

The term ‘ecosystem’ was introduced by Arthur Tansley in
1935. It describes a self-regulating community where liv-
ing organisms interact with each other and their physical
environment. For example, in a pond ecosystem, various

plants, animals, and microorganisms coexist and int
within their specific aquatic environment.

Energy Flow: The Sun is the primary source of energy
most ecosystems. Sunlight is captured by producers, ]j
plants, through the process of photosynthesis.

The other components worth most discussing are:
follows:

erg

Biological Components (Biotic): This includes
the living things in the pond, such as plants, anima
(frogs, fish, insects), bacteria, and algae.

Physical Components (Abiotic): These are the ng
living parts of the ecosystem, such as water, sg
nutrients, sunlight, and temperature. :

Producers (Autotrophs): These are organisms, typ
cally plants and algae, make their own food using su
light, water, and carbon dioxide. They form the base
of the energy pyramid in an ecosystem. /

Consumers (Heterotrophs): These organisms can.
not produce their own food and must consume othe:
organisms. Consumers are divided into different
categories:
e Primary Consumers:
producers. a
* Secondary Consumers: Carnivores or omnivore
that eat primary consumers.
e Tertiary Consumers: Predators that eat second-
ary consumers.
Decomposers and Detritivores: These organism:
like fungi and bacteria, break down dead organisms
and waste materials, releasing nutrients back into
the environment. They play a crucial role in recycling
energy and matter within the ecosystem.
Energy Transfer: Energy is transferred between tro-
phic levels (producers, consumers, decomposers),
typically through consumption. However, during
each transfer, some energy is lost as heat due to met:
abolic processes, as described by the Second Law 0
Thermodynamics.

Energy Loss and 10% Energy Rule: The energy flow
is always uni-directional; it goes in one direction. The
concept of energy loss tells us about the essence 0
‘unidirectional’ (one way) energy flow in ecosystems.
Energy moves from one trophic level to another but
‘without any returning’. A significant portion of energy
is lost as heat during various biological processes like
digestion, metabolism, maintaining body temperature
etc. Thus, we need the continuous energy input, primal
ily from sunlight, to sustain the different trophic levels
in an ecosystem. The 10% Energy Rule also tells us that
only 10% of energy is transferred from one tropic levé
to another, and 90% is the ‘Energy Loss’. Include the
following definitions also, This can be understood bet
ter with the help of a diagram, refer figure 9.4.

We observe how the biotic and abiotic com-
ponents interact and function together as a

forests, marine, and deserts, each with unique
characteristics. —

Ecosystems vary in size and composition but share
basic structural and functional characteristics.

ulated to ensure stability and balance. :

Trophic Levels in an Aquatic System

1. Oligotrophic: Low in nutrients and hence low
biological productivity. They typically have
clear water with high oxygen levels, this support
species like trout. ;

Mesotrophic: Intermediate level of nutrients
and biological productivity. They support more
productivity.

. Eutrophic: Thy are high in nutrients, particularly
nitrogen and phosphorus, thus have high biologi-
cal productivity in terms of abundant plant and
algal growth. This leads to problems like algal |
blooms and low oxygen levels in deeper waters |
due to the decomposition of dead algae and plants.
Hypertrophic: These are extremely nutrient-rich |
water bodies, often suffering from severe prob-
lems like dense algal blooms, very low oxygen lev-
els in deeper waters, and poor water clarity.

This concept of Ecological Pyramid was developed by
Charles Elton in 1927. They are a simplified representa-
tion of a complex system. We already discussed producers
and consumers in the context, with producers at the bot-
tom and herbivores and carnivores at the top.

Figure 9.2 Energy Pyramid

The following three types of ecological pyramids are
interconnected.

1. Pyramid of Energy: This represents the flow of
energy through an ecosystem. Energy is transferred
from one trophic level to the next, but not all of it is
available for consumption at the next level. In fact,
only about 10% of the energy is transferred to the
next level, with the remaining 90% being lost as heat
or used in respiration.

We can again look at grass + deer— tiger. The energy
is lost at each trophic level.

2. Pyramid of Numbers: The pyramid of numbers rep-
resents the number of organisms at each trophic level.
The pyramid of numbers can be upright, inverted, or
partly upright. ;
Upright Pyramid: In a forest ecosystem, the trees are
the primary producers, and most numerous. There
are fewer herbivores, such as deer or rabbits, and even
fewer carnivores, such as wolves or bears.

Inverted Pyramid: In a marine or aquatic ecosys-
tem such as pond, the biomass of primary consumers
(zooplankton, the herbivores) can indeed be larger
than the biomass of primary producers (phytoplank-
ton, reproduce quickly).

3. Pyramid of Biomass: This represents the total mass
of organisms at each trophic level. The pyramid of
biomass is usually upright, but it can be inverted in
some cases,

We can take the example of grass, zebra and lion h
again. There is same example of inverted as Was
pyramid of numbers.

being, providing us with food, medicine, clean air an
water, and recreational opportunities. However, humai
activities like habitat destruction, pollution, and overus
of resources are causing a decline in many species. Th
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is also in th
syllabus, that is an international treaty adopted in 1992.

An ecotone is the transition zone or area between tw
biomes, ecosystems, or habitats, where there is often ;
high degree of biodiversity and species interaction. Thi
following concepts are important in ecotone.

1. Edge Effect: The edge effect in ecology refers to th
changes in population or community structures tha
occur at the boundary of two or more habitats. Area
where different habitats meet, such as forests and
grasslands, are known as ‘edges.’ This effect has sev
eral key aspects such as increased diversity at bound
aries, differential environment conditions, specie
interaction. The whole situation may be beneficial t
some, but detrimental for others.
Human activities often create artificial edges, suc
as those formed by agriculture, logging, or urba
development.

2. Habitat loss: This refers to the disappearance of nat
ural environments that are home to particular plants”
and animals. This may occur due to deforestation,
urbanization, agriculture expansion, climate change,
pollution etc.

3. Biodiversity Hotspots: Biodiversity hotspots are
areas of high ecological richness and diversity, often

found in ecotones, which are transition zones between
‘different ecosystems. These ecotones showcase a
greater variety of plant and animal life compared to
the neighbouring ecosystems. :
Fragmentation: Fragmentation turns a large, con-
tinuous natural area (like an ecotone) into smaller,
-_jsolated pieces due to human development activities.
This is harmful as it reduces the overall area where

ants and animals can live. Species that need large,
uninterrupted spaces may struggle or decline as they

Atmosphere (Air)

The atmosphere is a mixture of gases surrounding the
Earth, primarily composed of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon
dioxide, argon, and other trace gases, along with water
vapor. It is divided into several layers, with distinct char-
acteristics:

TROPOSPHERE

e The altitude ranges from the Earth’s surface to about
8-14.5 km.

° In troposphere, all human activities and nearly all
weather phenomena take place. It contains the major-
ity of the atmosphere’s mass and is where we experi-
ence daily weather patterns.

e Importance also lies in the fact that troposphere holds
the air we breathe and the water vapor that forms
clouds and precipitation.

sphere, that reflects the decrease in temperature
with increase in altitude (height). This reduction is

with meteorology. :

Altitude: This extends from above the troposphere up
to about 50 km high. :
Atmospheric Pressure: This layer is about 1/1000th
of the pressure at sea level.
Ozone Layer: This layer lies within stratosphere
that is located roughly between 15 and 35 km above
Earth. This layer acts as a protective shield against the
sun’s harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, preventing most
of them from reaching the Earth’s surface. Thus, it
protects the life on earth.
The most harmful UV-C is almost completely
absorbed by the ozone layer, UV-B is also harmful but
is absorbed less.
Otherwise, exposure to high level of UV radiations
can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and damage to the
DNA of living cells.

crucial role in the Earth’s ecosystem, providing habitat for
a multitude of species, influencing climate patterns, and
serving as significant carbon sinks.

.

FORESTS AS A RESOURCE

* Biodiversity: Forests are caste and cradle to biodi-
versity, they are rich in it. They function as ‘terrestrial
lungs’ of the earth, they regulate climate and main-
taining air quality. they house a vast array of flora and
fauna, including several endangered species. National
Parks, Wild Sanctuary Parks, Biosphere reserves are
required to conserve biodiversity.

e Economic Value: They contribute to the economy
through timber, non-timber forest products (like
medicinal plants and bamboo), and ecotourism.

e Environmental Importance: Forests in India play a
vital role in water conservation, soil preservation, and
climate regulation.

Facts Aspout Forests in INDIA

* India has tropical evergreens, deciduous forests,
thorn forests, and mangroves. The Western Ghats, the
Eastern Himalayas, and the Northeastern region are
some of the most forest-rich areas.

India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2021:

*. The ISFR 2021 shows an increase of 0.28% in for-

est and tree cover, with a slight increase of 0.22%

in forest cover and 0.76% in tree cover compared to
the previous report. The total forest and tree cove
of India are now 80.9 million hectares, which js an
increase of 2,261 square kilometers from 2019,
¢ .The increase in forest and tree cover is largely dug
to plantations and assisted natural regeneration
Plantations account for 47% of the increase, while
assisted natural regeneration accounts for 39%, :
¢ Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarp
are the three leading states in forest coverage; they
together account for almost half of India’s forest ang _
tree cover.
¢ The three states with the highest percentage of forest.
and tree cover are Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and
Manipur. The forest cover percentage is more than
75%. oe
° India’s forest and tree cover is still below the global.
average.

DEFORESTATION

Deforestation is the extensive removal of Earth’s forests
leading to land degradation. At the current rate of defor.
estation, the world’s precious rainforests are predicted to.
disappear within a century. The primary drivers of defor.
estation include:

1. Agriculture Expansion: Agriculture, including sub
sistence and commercial farming, is the leading cause _
of deforestation, responsible for 85% of forest loss.

2. Shifting Cultivation: This practice, seen in regions _
like Assam and Madagascar, involves clearing small.
patches of tropical forests for crops. They lead to a.
pattern of unsustainable land use practices. This often
occurs in tropical regions with fertile soils.

3. Timber Harvesting: The logging for wood and
paper products contributes to 14% of deforestation
Countries like Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil,
Argentina, and various African nations are prominent.
examples.

4. Hill Slope Cultivation: Terrace farming, known as
contour farming, involves farming on narrow steps _
cut across hillsides. This practice can lead to soil
erosion.

5. Wildfires: These are influenced by human and nat-
ural factors. Climate change has increased the fre-
quency and intensity of wildfires. Australia, Canada
can be taken as the best examples.

Negative Effects of Deforestation

Deforestation has significant environmental conse-
quences:

1. Climate Change: Deforestation results in less carbon
dioxide absorption, leading to increased Green House
Gas emissions and global warming.

2. Water Cycle Disruption: Trees contribute to the
water cycle by returning water vapor to the atmo-
sphere. Deforestation decreases precipitation, impact-
ing water availability.



=== Page 11 ===
soil Erosion: Tree roots stabilize soil, preventing ero-
sion and landslides. Deforestation raises the risk of
Jandslides and flash floods.

pesertification: Excessive tree removal contributes
to desertification, particularly in drylands. This leads
to land degradation and threatens ecosystems.
piodiversity Loss: Deforestation reduces habitat for
countless species, contributing to biodiversity loss.

EARTHQUAKES

An earthquake is a sudden shaking of the Earth’s crust,
often with no warning, making prediction nearly impossi-
ble. Seismology is the scientific study of earthquakes and
the seismic waves they generate.

Causes of Earthquakes

e The Earth’s crust consists of plates, and the theory of
plate tectonics explains that stress occurs when these
plates interact. We can see the following concept:

° Pangaea Breakup: Pangaea is a supercontinent that
existed about 200 million years ago. This breakup led
to the formation of the continents as we know them
today. India is an example of that. The Himalayas
formed as a result of this collision between the Indian
and Eurasian tectonic plates. That process is still con-
tinuing, Himalayas rise a few centimetres every year,
and earthquakes do happen.

e Plates pull apart, push against each other, or slide
sideways, creating stress along plate boundaries
known as faults. :

e When stress ona fault reaches a breaking point, it results
in a fault rupture and the release of seismic waves, radi-
ating from an underground point known as the focus.

Types of Seismic Waves

e There are two main types of seismic. waves: body
waves and surface waves.

e Body waves: These travel through the Earth’s inte-
rior and include primary (P) waves and secondary (S)
waves.

° P waves are faster and typically the first to reach
seismograph stations. . :

e Surface waves: These move along the Earth’s crust,
shaking it both horizontally and vertically.

e Love waves (named after A.E.H. Love, a British
mathematician) cause horizontal motion, mov-
ing the ground from side to side. They occur as a

- result of an earthquake. They propagate outward
from the earthquake’s epicenter.

* Rayleigh waves (named after Lord Rayleigh, the
British physicist) produce vertical and side-to-
side motion, which can damage buildings and
infrastructure.

Measuring Earthquake Intensity

Richter Scale: They measure the magnitude of an earth-
quake, essentially quantifying the amount of energy it
releases. A higher magnitude indicates a more powerful
earthquake with stronger shaking. Their measurement
is logarithmic in nature and theoretically they start from
zero and goes to any level. It is not considered valid for
earthquakes with magnitudes below 3.0 or above 7.0 as
the scale gets saturated beyond a level.

° Seismograph: This device records the vibrations of

the ground during an earthquake. This data is then

. used to calculate the earthquake’ $ magnitude on the
Richter Scale.

° Magnitude and Energy Release: Each whole num},
increase on the Richter Scale (e.g., from 6.5 to 7
indicates a tenfold increase in the shaking amplitud

_ (ground motions) and approximately 30-32 (31.6 i

_ be more precise) times more energy release.

The Classification of intensification of
Earthquakes

1. Micro earthquakes: Less than 2.0 magnitude - 'T
are very small, they are typically not felt by humans

2. Minor earthquakes: 2.0-3.9 magnitude - They are
often felt as a trembling or shaking sensation, but
they rarely cause damage.

3. Major earthquakes: 4.0-5.9 magnitude - They can
cause moderate damage to buildings and infrastruc.
ture, especially if they occur in densely Populated
areas.

4. Great earthquakes: 6.0-6.9 magnitude - They are
capable of causing significant damage and wide.
spread destruction.

5. Higher earthquakes: 7.0 magnitude and above.
They are the most powerful earthquakes, capable
of causing catastrophic damage and widespread
destruction over large areas.

hey

A Shift Towards Moment Magnitude Scale (MM Scale):
MM more accurately measure the energy of larger earth-
quakes and is more universally applicable globally.

The MM Scale is a seismic scale used for measuring the
intensity of an earthquake. Unlike scales that measure
the energy or magnitude of an earthquake, the MM Scale
assesses the effects and damage caused by the earthquake.
It isa descriptive scale, using Roman numerals from I to
XII to denote increasing levels of damage and impact:

1. I (Not felt): Barely noticeable, if at all.

2. XII (Extreme): Total destruction — objects thrown
into the air, landscapes changed.

Seismic Zones in India

© India is divided into four seismic zones: Zone II, Ill, [V,
and V, with Zone V being the most seismically active
and Zone II the least.

° Zone V includes northeastern India, parts of Jammu
and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and more.

° Zone IV covers remaining parts of Jammu and.
Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, and other regions.

e Zone Il includes Kerala, Goa, parts of northern |
states, and more.

¢ Zone Il encompasses the rest of the country.

EARTHQUAKE MiiriGATION Practices

Effective earthquake mitigation requires a compre-_
hensive and integrated approach, combining robust
construction practices, informed public preparedness,
cutting- -edge engineering, and advanced technology for
early warnings.



=== Page 13 ===
d Building Codes

pureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Guidelines:
se are guidelines for constructing buildings that
an resist seismic forces. The focus is on using mate-
d designs that can absorb and dissipate seis-
thereby reducing the damage during an
unicipality Checks: This ensures the adherence to
uidelines. There is rigorous scrutiny of architectural
designs, structural plans, and construction materials
to ensure safety standards are met.

blic Education on Earthquakes

nderstanding Earthquakes: This entails explain-
ing seismic waves, fault lines, and how tectonic move-
_ments cause tremors. It makes people understand why
certain regions are more prone to seismic activities.
preparedness Measures: Teaching practical skills
like ‘Drop, Cover, and Hold On’, how to create an
emergency kit, and evacuation routes.

gineered Structures

Design and Construction: To follow seismic design
principles, like flexibility in structures, appropriate
load distribution, and using materials that can with-
stand vibrations.

Architectural and Engineering Integration:
Architects and engineers must collaborate to incor-
porate aesthetic elements without compromising the
building’s seismic resilience.

Soil Analysis: Before construction, it’s vital to assess
the soil’s ability to support a structure during an
earthquake. Soil types like clay or sand can amplify
seismic waves, thus requiring specialized foundation
techniques.

arly Warning Systems

Seismic Monitoring: Advanced technologies like
seismographs, GPS, and accelerometers are used
to detect the slightest ground movements. These
systems can provide crucial seconds to minutes of
warning, allowing people and systems to initiate pre-
defined safety protocols.

Public Alert Systems: These can range from mobile
alerts, sirens, to broadcast systems, ensuring timely
and widespread dissemination of warnings to all seg-
ments of the population.

SUNAMIS

he term ‘tsunami? originates from the Japanese words
Tsu,’ -meaning harbour, and ‘nami, meaning waves.
stinamis are a series of ocean waves characterized by
ery long wavelengths, often spanning hundreds of kms.
hey are typically caused by significant disturbances in
_the ocean, including:

1. Earthquakes ~ primarily cause of earthquakes.
2. Landslides
3. Voleanic eruptions

4. Explosions
5. Meteorite impacts

° These disturbances can occur beneath the ocean’s
surface (e.g., underwater earthquakes or submarine
landslides) or from above (e.g., meteorite impacts).

e Tsunamis have a large wave height, long wave period
and high velocity.. Tsunamis can have wavelengths
ranging from 10 to 500 kms, with wave periods of up
to an hour. Due to their long wavelengths, tsunamis
behave as shallow-water waves.

* When tsunamis approach the shore, they can reach
significant vertical heights, often referred to as ‘run-
up heights. The depth of the ocean is the primary fac-
tor determining the height of a tsunami wave when it
reaches the shore.

e As tsunamis approach shallow coastal waters, their
speed increases, while their wavelength decreases.

© Tsunamis can travel across the open ocean at approxi-
mately 100 kms per hour. A series of waves that make
up a tsunami is called a ‘tsunami train.’

e Tsunamis have the potential to cause massive destruc-
tion upon reaching the coastline, leading to coastal
erosion, vegetation loss, and limited warning time for
coastal residents.

° Pacific Ocean is the main source of tsunamis. North
America is also at a higher risk for tsunamis due to its
location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.

° Coastal regions often have a ‘tsunami warning system’ .
to monitor and provide alerts. Unusually calm and
receding ocean water can serve as an early warning
sign of an impending tsunami.

Examples

° In March 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake triggered

a devastating tsunami in Japan, causing severe dam-

age and nuclear pollution. The Fukushima Daiichi
Nuclear Power Plant was affected by this Tsunami.

° Similarly, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, caused by a

9.1 magnitude quake near Sumatra, led to over 230,000

deaths and widespread destruction across 14 countries.

CYCLONES

Cyclones are regions of low atmospheric pressure sur-
rounded by high-pressure systems, resulting in swirling
atmospheric disturbances with powerful winds. General
features of a typical cyclone:



=== Page 14 ===
1. Strong winds: Cyclone winds can reach speeds of up
to 252 km/h (157 mph).

2. Exceptional rain: Cyclones can produce heavy rain-
fall, which can lead to flooding.

3. Storm surge: Storm surge is a sudden rise in sea level
caused by a cyclone. It can inundate coastal areas and
cause extensive damage.

* In the northern hemisphere, cyclonic winds rotate
counterclockwise, while in the southern hemisphere,
they rotate clockwise.

* Cyclones are primarily observed in tropical and tem-
perate regions worldwide.

Nomenclature of Cyclones: They are known by different
names across the world.

Tropical Cyclones

South America

Tornadoes

In India, cyclones are moderate in nature, with the
state of Odisha being particularly vulnerable.

Damage Caused by Cyclones

¢ Cyclones are categorized into five levels, with
Category 5 being the most severe, featuring extremely
high wind speeds up to 252 kms per hour. |

e Cyclones can cause widespread damage to infrastruc-
ture and buildings.

¢ They can also lead to flooding, landslides, and power
outages.

e Cyclones can also cause outbreaks of diseases such as
malaria and diarrhea.

Cyclone Mitigation Measures

¢ Green belt plantation: Planting trees and shrubs along
the coast can help to reduce the impact of cyclones by
weakening the wind and absorbing rainwater.

° Early warning systems: Early warning systems can
help to alert people to the impending arrival of a
cyclone and give them time to evacuate to safety.

e Cyclone shelters: Cyclone shelters can provide safe
refuge for people who cannot evacuate their homes.

The Naming of Cyclones
The cyclones are named by the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO), a part of UN.

WMO has six regional specialized meteorological centres
(RSMCs) for naming cyclones in their respective regions. The
RSMC for India is the IMD (India Meteorological Department)
which maintains 169 names. The names are suggested by the
13 member countries of the WMO/ Economic and Social
Coramission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Panel on
Tropical Cyclones. The names are chosen to be familiar and
easily recognizable to the people in the region.

The names of cyclones-in India in 2023 were Agn
Akash, Bijli, Onil, Ogni, Nisha, Giri, Varun, Murasy and
Aag. The cyclones ‘Neer’, ‘Prabha’, and ‘Ghurni’ are the
names for cyclones that are expected to form in 2024,

The major cyclones in India were:

Main Factors for Bay of Bengal Facing More Cyclones
than Arabian Sea :

=

The shape of the Bay of Bengal is a relatively shallow
embayment with a wide continental shelf. This shape
makes it more susceptible to the formation of strong
cyclonic circulations. The Arabian Sea is a deeper ang
more elongated sea that is less conducive to the for.
mation of cyclones.

The Bay of Bengal has warmer Sea Surface Temperature
(SST) than the Arabian Sea. Warm SSTs are a neces.
sary condition for the formation of cyclones, as they
provide the energy needed for cyclones to develop and
intensify.

3. Moreover, the Bay of Bengal has lower vertical wind
shear than the Arabian Sea, which makes it more
favorable for the formation of cyclones.

Volcanoes

Volcanoes are openings or ruptures in the Earth’s surface
or crust. They are typically associated with the release of
extremely hot gases, ash, sulphur, steam, and other mat
rials during eruptions, known as pyroclastic flows. Thes
flows can reach speeds of more than 700 kms per hour
and can be highly destructive.

Volcanoes are often found in regions where tecton
plates either converge (collide) or diverge (move apart).
Subduction zones, where an oceanic plate sinks beneath a
continental plate, are common locations for volcanic activ-
ity. Volcanoes also exist along the edges of tectonic plates,
such as the ‘Ring of Fire’ encircling the Pacific Ocean.

canic eruptions can have various consequences, including:

Threats to aircraft due to volcanic ash.
‘Alteration of global temperatures as volcanic ash
and sulfuric acid droplets block sunlight and cool the
Earth’s lower atmosphere.
Eruption hazards associated with lava flows, ashfall,
and pyroclastic flows.

oops

ods are high water levels that inundate land that is not
sually submerged. There are three main types of floods:
jash floods, riverine floods, and urban floods.

lash Floods

‘lash floods are rapid inland floods caused by intense

infall. They can occur in sloped or flat terrains, but they

gre most common in sloped terrains where the water
ows rapidly with high destructive potential. Flash floods

can occur virtually anywhere, even in areas that are not

typically prone to flooding.

Causes of Flash Floods

Heavy rainfall in a short span of time: Flash floods
are typically associated with thunderstorms, which can
produce very heavy rainfall in a short amount of time.
Heavy siltation of the river bed: Siltation is the buildup
of sediment in the river bed. Heavy siltation can reduce
the water-carrying capacity of rivers and streams, mak-
ing them more likely to overflow during heavy rainfall.
Blockage in the drains: Blockages in drains can also
lead to flash flooding, as the water cannot drain away
quickly enough. Blockages can be caused by debris,
leaves, or even animals.

Landslides blocking the flow of the stream:

Landslides can block the flow of streams, causing

water to back up and flood the surrounding area.

Construction of dams and reservoirs: Dams and

reservoirs can help to control flooding, but they can

also increase the risk of flash flooding if they are not
properly managed.

° Strong winds accompanied by heavy downpour
along with storm surge in areas prone to cyclones:
Cyclones can produce strong winds and heavy rainfall,
which can lead to flash flooding. Storm surge, which is
a wall of water that is pushed up the coast by a cyclone,
can also contribute to flash flooding in coastal areas.

» Catabatic Winds: Winds that flow downhill, usually at
night when the air cools and becomes denser. They can
push warm, moist air up slopes, leading to cloud forma-
tion and heavy rain, potentially causing flash floods.

° Anabatic Winds: Winds that flow uphill, typically
_ during the day when the ground heats up, making
the air less dense. These winds can break up clouds,
reducing the likelihood of flash flooding.

CLouDBURST

® Cloudburst is an intense, brief rainfall event with hail
and thunder, causing flash floods and landslides.

e It lasts only a few minutes but can bring a massive
amount of rain.

e Cloudbursts are unpredictable and can lead to severe
weather events, like the 2013 disaster in Uttarakhand,
India, causing loss of life.

DROUGHT

Drought is when there’s not enough rain for a long time,
causing problems like water shortages, failed crops, and
distress. Even places with lots of rain, like Kerala, can
experience drought when there’s an imbalance between
water supply and demand.

There are four primary types of droughts:

1. Meteorological Drought: Characterized by less rain-
fall than usual, resulting in prolonged periods of sun
and heat..

2. Hydrological Drought: Happens when water bodies
like rivers and groundwater are reduced, leading to a
shortage of water.

3. Agricultural Drought: Occurs when soil moisture is
too low for crops to grow properly, potentially leading
to food shortages.

4, Socioeconomic Drought: A situation where water
scarcity impacts the economy and society, affecting
food, water availability, and jobs.

Artificial Rain

Cloud seeding is important for reducing droughts, help-
ing agriculture, managing forest fires, and cutting air pol-
lution. It involves spreading materials like silver iodide
or dry ice in clouds to cause rain. Drones and aircraft are
used for this. Nations such as China, UAE, and the USA
widely use cloud seeding for different environmental
needs, showing its global importance.

LANDSLIDES

Landslides are the downward and outward movement of
slope-forming materials, such as rocks, soils, and artificial

fills, along surfaces of separation. They can be slow or fast,

and can occur in a variety of settings, including moun-
tainous terrains, areas with steep slopes, and areas where
human activities have disturbed the natural landscape.

Causes of Landslides
Landslides are influenced by several factors:

° Geological Factors: Weakness in slope materials like
soil or rock increases landslide risk.

e Erosion: Caused by rainfall, wind, or human activi-
ties like deforestation, erosion makes slopes more
prone to landslides. oo

° Heavy Rainfall: This can saturate and increase the

weight of slope materials, triggering landslides on
steep terrain.

e Human Activities: Mining, deforestation, irrigation,
and construction can destabilize slopes.

e Earthquakes: These can induce landslides by shak-
ing and loosening ground materials.



=== Page 16 ===
$.16

* Volcanic Eruptions: These can create debris flows, a
landslide type involving fast-moving water, rock, and
mud.

Landslides can lead to loss of life, property damage, and
environmental impacts. Mitigation includes careful land
use, soil stabilization, and proper drainage management.

Wildfires

A wildfire refers to an uncontrolled fire that ignites in
combustible vegetation in rural or wilderness areas. What
sets wildfires apart from other types of fires is their exten-
sive size and rapid spread far beyond the initial source.
Additionally, wildfires are unpredictable, capable of
changing direction suddenly and leaping over natural or
man-made barriers like roads, rivers, and firebreaks.

Nationa Disaster Manacement Act or 2005
~ NDMA

NDMA of 2005 in India designates the Ministry of Home
Affairs as the primary coordinator for disaster manage-
ment. Key decision-making bodies include the Cabinet
Committee on Security (CCS), with the Prime Minister as a
member, and the National Crisis Management Committee
(NCMC). NDMA plays a crucial role in developing disaster
management plans and overseeing their implementation
at the national level.

Figure 9.12

National Disaster Management

The 2001 High Power Committee on Disaster Management
proposed a tiered approach for managing disasters:

1. Level LO: This is a period of normalcy, focusing on
reducing disaster risk.

2. Level L1: Refers to disasters manageable at the dis-
trict level, with state authorities on standby to assist if
necessary.

3. Level L2: Involves disasters requiring state-level
intervention and resources, with central agencies
ready for immediate deployment if needed.

4. Level L3: Indicates large-scale or catastrophic events
that surpass district and state capabilities, necessitat-
ing central intervention.

The NDMA and other central government agencies pla
supporting role at Level L1 and L2 disasters. At Leve| L

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES IN SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT

This historical perspective is crucial for setting MDGs
and SDGs over a period of time, how do our governments
get motivated to set their right policies for the welfare of
people.

1. Thomas Robert Malthus (1798): Malthus said that
if we have too many people and not enough resources
like food and space, it can cause problems. He talked
about two ways to control the population: by choos-
ing when to have children or by things like famine,
disease, or wars.

2. Garrett James Hardin (1968): Hardin talked about

a problem called the ‘Tragedy of the Commons.’ It

means if everyone uses something like land or water

without thinking about the future, it can harm the
environment.

Club of Rome: This is a global think tank to ensure that

world is a better place to live, people get what they need

without hurting the planet. This report raised awarenes
about the finite nature of resources, the potential fo
environmental degradation, and the need for sustain
able development strategies to address these challenges
4. UN Conference on the Human Environment
(1972): This conference is also known as Stockholm
Conference. This proved to be a turning point an
laid the groundwork for future environmental agree- -
ments and discussions on sustainable development. _
5. Brundtland Commission (1983): Sustainable
development was defined in the 1987 ‘Our Common
Future’ report. It means that meeting today’s need
without harming future generations’ ability to meet
theirs. It stresses balancing economic, social, an
environmental goals. :
6. Agenda 21 in Rio Earth Summit (1992): This approach |
envisioned the world’s future, emphasizing shared respon _
sibilities to address climate change and global warming. It _
led to creating the UN Framework Convention on Climate.
Change (UNFCCC), crucial in global climate negotiations.



=== Page 19 ===
/ Millennium Development Goals (MDGs - 2000):
_ The countries set some goals such as in health, educa-
tion, and reducing poverty.

, UN Conference on Sustainable Development
_ (Rio+20) (2012): The Rio+20 conference was held
20 years after the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. It adopted
the motto ‘The Future We Want.’ It reviewed progress,
and focused the need for inclusivity and participation.
This laid the groundwork for the SDGs in 2015.
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): After
2015, countries agreed on new goals to make the
_-world better by 2030. These goals are about things

- care of our planet.

iLLENIUM DeveLopment Goats (MDGS)
DGs were set up in September 2000.

These MDGs consisted of eight goals for a target
' achievement year of 2015.

These goals focused on combating poverty, hunger,
disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation, and
discrimination against women.

The MDGs emphasized human capital, infrastructure,
and human rights to improve living standards.

e Eight MDGs were:

. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.

. Achieve universal primary education.

Promote gender equality and empower women.
4. Reduce child mortality.

5. Improve maternal health.

6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.
Ensure environmental sustainability.

Develop a global partnership for development.

A Shift from MDGs To SDGs

The shift represents a significant evolution in global devel-
opment objectives. Key differentiating points include:

. Zero Goals: Unlike MDGs which aimed for halfway
targets, SDGs aim for complete eradication, e.g., zero
hunger, zero preventable child deaths.

Universal Goals: SDGs apply universally to all coun-
tries, addressing inequalities within and among coun-
tries, unlike the MDGs’ donor-recipient approach.
Comprehensive and Inclusive: SDGs are more inclu-
sive, covering broader areas like gender and people’s
participation, and they segregate goals like hunger
and poverty, which were combined in MDGs.
Funding: SDGs emphasize sustainability and inclu-
sive economic development for self-reliance, mov-
ing away from MDGs’ reliance on aid from developed
countries.

Peace Building: SDGs include peace as a crucial
goal for societal prosperity, which was not a focus in
MDGs.

» Data Revolution: SDGs have enhanced focus on
monitoring, evaluation, and accountability across
various demographics.

7. Quality Education: While MDGs focused on univer-
sal primary education, SDGs aim for quality educa-
tion at all levels with improved indicators,

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

SDGs are a set of 17 interconnected goals adopted by the
United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development. These goals are a universal call
to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that
all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. Each goal
has specific targets to be achieved over the next 15 years.

India’s Approach to Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs): We are guided by the following principles:

¢ Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (Whole World is One

Energy is the ability to do work or cause change. It’s fun-
damental in nature.

For examples, radiant energy from the sun warms
Earth. Cars use mechanical energy from fuel. We use elec-
trical energy to charge phones.

1. Conservation Law: Energy can’t be created or
destroyed, only changed in form. This is key to under-
standing energy dynamics.

2. Energy in Society: Essential for food and water secu-
rity, development, and climate adaptation. The pro-
duction and use may become part of anthropogenic
activities.

3. Shift to Renewables: Moving from natural to human-
driven conditions requires more renewable energy.

Ipea. Enercy Source CHARACTERISTICS

* Optimal heat production per unit volume/mass

° Easy transportation

° Minimal pollution

® Cost-effectiveness

¢ Energy, the ability to do work, is fundamental for liv-
ing beings, machinery, and all forms of matter. The
progress of civilization hinges on the availability and
use of energy.

* Energy exists in various forms, each serving differ-
ent purposes and evolving over time to meet human
needs.

Common Forms oF ENERGY

1. Mechanical Energy:
Kinetic Energy (KE): This is the energy that an object
possesses due to its motion. For example, a moving
car or a rolling ball has kinetic energy because of its
movement.

Potential Energy (PE): This energy type relates to an
object’s position or state. Examples are compressed
springs, a book lying on the table, and water in the
dam. The stored energy in a compressed spring or an
elevated object (such as water in dams) can be con-
verted into kinetic energy when released, as in the
case of a falling book or energy production through
dams. This energy is known as PE.

Law of Conservation of Energy:

e Energy remains constant in the universe, trans-
forming from one form to another. This is exem-
plified by the conversion of potential energy to
kinetic energy in hydroelectric dams.

e Besides transformation, the energy balance is
important.

2. Thermal Energy: This is related to the temperature of
asubstance, arising from the movement of molecules.
Chemical Energy: We can take an example of coal
that is a fossil fuel. It has been discussed separately.
Nuclear Energy: When nuclear mass is converted
into thermal energy.

InDIA’s Enercy LANDSCAPE

° The Electricity Act of 2003 was aimed at introducing
competition, safeguarding consumer interests, and
ensuring power for all.

® India’s energy sector is diverse, with contributions
from central, state, and private sectors.

® India is the third-largest electricity producer and sec-
ond-largest consumer globally.

® India uses a diverse energy mix in the following forms:

ENERGY CLASSIFICATION

° Primary Energy: Natural sources like coal and sun-
light. This can be renewable (like sunlight) or non-
renewable (like coal).

¢ Secondary Energy: Converted forms like electricity,
suitable for consumption in homes and industries.

Fossil Fuels

Fossil Fuels are Non-Renewable Fuels. The main type of
non-renewable energy, formed from decayed plants and
animals over millions of years. They are Limited in quan-
tity and diminish with use. The main examples are coal,
oil, and natural gas. They are mostly used in transporta-
tion and energy sectors.

Advantages: _
* High energy yield per unit
© Established technology for use
® Developed trading market

Disadvantages:
* Contribute to global warming.
¢ Health issues due to pollutants like sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxides.
® Oil spills harming marine ecosystems.

Status of Nuclear Energy: According to sovernmen
policy, nuclear energy is categorized as a non-fossi] ¢..
source because it doesn’t emit GHGs that contribute ,,
global warming. Its origin is distinct from fossil fy
However, since uranium, the fuel for nuclear power |
finite, nuclear energy is considered a non-renewahy
resource.

Types of Enercy

These shift from one type of energy to other have no
taken place in an abrupt manner but were gradual.

¢ During the Stone Age, wood was the main source of
energy.

° As societies advanced, coal became the dominan,
energy source in the Iron Age.

° In modern times, we primarily use petroleum ang
natural gas as our main energy sources. on

° Now we look at the energy sector shift from non
renewable energy towards renewable energy.

Non-Renewable Energy

Non-renewable energy sources are finite resources that
cannot be replenished in a short time frame. They include.
fossil fuels and nuclear energy.

Benefits:
° Reliability: Provide a constant, reliable power source.

° Infrastructure: Existing extensive infrastructure for
extraction, processing, and distribution.

° High Energy Density: Offer high energy output for
industrial and commercial use.

Examples: Coal, Oil, Natural Gas, Nuclear Energy

Renewable Energy

These energy sources are those that can be naturally
replenished over a short period. They are considered sus-
tainable and endless.

Benefits:

° Environmental: Lower greenhouse gas emissions,

reduced pollution.

° Economic: Job creation in green technologies, poten-

tial for lower energy costs in the long term.

° Energy Security: Reduced dependence on imported
fuels.

Examples: Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Hydropower,
Biomass, Geothermal etc.

Shift in Government Approach Towards Renewable.
Energy: This shift has happened due to following rea-
sons:

1. International Commitments: The government
has made international commitments in the form
of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions
CINDCs), Glasgow commitments, Kyoto Protocol,
Paris agreement and so on (discussed later).

2. Regulate Emissions: We can take example Supreme
Court emission norms on festivals, vehicles etc.



=== Page 23 ===
pevelop Transition Policies: There is a transition
from non renewable towards renewable policy norms.
The Government has implemented Bharat Norms also.
Redirect Subsidies and Incentives: This helps in
‘making renewable products competitive and finan-
cially viable. There are less or no taxes on electrical
‘cars in India.

promote Renewable Energy Use: Through incen-
tives for solar, wind, hydro, and other renewable
energy installations.

Set Renewable Energy Targets: Establish ambitious
targets for renewable energy capacity to ensure a
significant portion of energy comes from renewable
sources.

Support International Collaboration: Participate
in international efforts and collaborations for tech-
nology transfer and funding in renewable energy
projects.

Jon Renewable Sources of Energy
Fossil Fuels) :

SOAL

e Coal is created from ancient plant decay, is a major
energy source.

Coal contains chemical energy in carbon compounds.
The burning of coal releases energy as carbon dioxide
and water vapor.
In power plants, this heat turns water into steam,
driving turbines for electricity.

Energy conversion in coal usage involves changing
chemical energy to thermal, then to mechanical, and
finally into electrical energy.

eat: Peat is an early stage of coal formation. The car-
on contents are 50-60%. In transformation, under heat
nd pressure, it evolves into lignite, bituminous coal, and
nally anthracite.

ignite (Brown Coal): The carbon content is 70%. This
the lowest rank of coal with high moisture content. This
often used in electricity generation.

ituminous Coal (Soft Coal): The carbon content is
bout 80%. The usage is common in both power genera-
on and industrial applications. The Coke Production
appens by heating at high temperatures for steel produc-
on.

ewable Anthracite: This is the highest grade of coal. It means
ng rea hat the burning produces minimal smoke, indicating
igher purity and efficiency.

° India mainly mines bituminous and sub-bituminous
coal, which have moderate to high carbon but lower
moisture than lignite. However, this Indian coal often
has high ash and low energy content, reducing its
energy production efficiency.

© India imports coking coal (high-quality coal, high car-
bon content, few impurities) that is required by the
steel industry.

® India also imports high-grade thermal coal which has
a higher calorific value and is more efficient for power
generation.

© The other factors are demand supply gaps, cost effec-
tiveness and logistics.

° India’s main coal deposits are in the Gondwana
region, specifically the Damodar Valley.

Burning too much coal leads to air pollution, health
problems, and climate change. Despite being a crucial
energy source in countries like China, India, the USA,
Australia, and Indonesia, it is a major cause of pollution
and global warming.

Coal Bed Methane (CBM)

CBM is a natural gas, found in coal seams, released during
coal mining.

1. Cleaner but Less Dense: CBM burns cleaner than
coal but has lower energy density.

2. More CBM for Power: Needs more volume to pro-
duce the same electricity as coal.

3. India’s Potential: India’s large coal reserves present
significant CBM opportunities. India is 5th largest
producer of coal. CBM could help India cut down on
oil and gas imports and greenhouse gas emissions.

4. Environmental Challenges: Extraction of CBM cre-
ates issues like wastewater production and methane
leaks. These environmental risks require effective
management and mitigation strategies.

Petroleum Oil

Petroleum, found as crude oil in earth’s rock formations,
is a mixture of hydrocarbons processed by fractional dis-
tillation in refineries. Its extraction, refining, and burning
release significant greenhouse gases, making it a major
climate change contributor.

Natura. Gas

° Natural gas is a fossil fuel, this is notable for its high
calorific value. It is the cleanest-burning fossil fuel.

° Natural Gas originates from organic materials such as
plants and animals transformed by heat and pressure
over millions of years. This co-exists with oil and coal
in the Earth’s crust.

The composition of Natural Gas is given as follows:

° Primarily composed of methane (CH,), typically 70-90%.

e Natural Gas contains other gases like ethane, pro-
pane, butane, and traces of nitrogen, carbon dioxide,
and hydrogen sulphide.

° Natural gas is extracted from underground reservoirs,
commonly found alongside oil deposits.

© Uses of Natural Gas: It’s widely used for power gen-
eration, industrial and residential heating (especially
in Europe, Russia, USA, Canada), and as compressed
natural gas (CNG) for vehicles.



=== Page 24 ===
° Petrochemical Production: Natural gas is also a
key ingredient in producing plastics, fertilizers, and
pharmaceuticals.

Natural Gas Hydrates

* Found in ocean beds (deep ocean sediments) and
polar regions (permafrost regions), these ice-like
structures combine natural gas (mainly methane)
and water.

* These hydrates have the potential to be a major source
of energy in the future, but they are difficult and
expensive to extract.

® In India, significant hydrate resources are estimated,
especially in Western, Eastern, and Andaman offshore
areas.

Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Piped Natural
Gas (PNG)

° CNG is natural gas that has been compressed to a high
pressure so that it can be stored in a tank and used as
a vehicle fuel.

* CNG is cleaner than diesel and petrol, with lower
emissions.

* CNG has a higher octane rating.

* CNG is noted for being lighter, having a narrow igni-
tion range, and being more cost-effective compared to
conventional fuels.

° PNG is the same gas supplied to households and -

industries for cooking and other purposes.

* Both CNG and PNG primarily consist of methane
and have a compact molecular structure that reduces
ozone formation in the troposphere.

Suace Gas

Shale Gas is a natural gas found in fine-grained shale
rock formations. Shale rocks contain significant petro-
leum and natural gas reserves.

1. Technological Advancements: Recent develop-
ments, especially horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing (fracking), have made extraction feasible.

2. Horizontal Drilling: Involves creating long horizon-
tal boreholes in shale layers.

3. Hydraulic Fracturing: High-pressure fluids break
the rock to release trapped gas.

4. Industry Impact: These technologies have signifi-
cantly boosted the natural gas industry, notably in
USA which has become net energy exporter courtesy
shale gas.

BioGAs

Biogas is produced through the introduction of bacterial
action in digesters containing human and animal sewage,
including animal dung. The decomposition process yields
methane, a valuable fuel used for cooking and power gen-
eration. The residual matter, known as slurry, serves as
nutrient-rich manure for agricultural fields.

The normal biogas composition is given below:

* Primarily composed of methane, but typically
50-70% if compared with Natural Gas.

° Contains a higher percentage of carbon dioxide (c

’ than natural gas.

° Includes water vapor, hydrogen sulphide (H,s
traces of other gases.

Hydrogen
Hydrogen is the most abundant element on Earth and Po
sesses the highest calorific value among all fuels. While

does not exist naturally as a gas, it is a versatile ener
carrier. Let’s look at the following factors:

Advantages

1. High Energy Density: Its high energy density 5
weight makes it an efficient fuel.

2. Clean Combustion: Hydrogen produces only wate
vapor upon combustion, making it an environmen
tally friendly option.

3. Efficiency in Energy Conversion: Fuel cells usin
hydrogen are highly efficient.

4. Renewable and Abundant: Hydrogen can be pro
duced from renewable resources and is abundant 0
Earth.

5. Zero-Emissions and Clean Burning: It produces n
greenhouse gases in fuel cells and burns cleanly.

6. Versatile and Highly Reactive: Usable in various appli
cations and readily reacts with oxygen, forming water.

Limitations

1. Storage Challenges: Storing hydrogen is difficult

due to its low density.

2. Infrastructure Development Needs: Significant
infrastructure is required for production, distribution,

and refuelling.

3. Safety and Reactivity: Its high flammability and

reactivity require careful handling.

4. Environmental Impact of Production: Common
production methods, such as natural gas reforming,

can have environmental impacts.

5. Energy Conversion Challenges: Isolating hydrogen.

from other elements for use as a fuel or in electric-

ity generation through fuel cells presents technical

challenges.

Hydrogen Mission in India
India has launched the National Hydrogen Mission to har-

ness the potential of hydrogen as a clean and sustainable

energy source. This mission aims to:

1. Develop hydrogen as an alternative fuel for transpor-
tation, industry, and power generation.

2. Promote the production of green hydrogen using
renewable energy sources and electrolysers.

,en can be categorized into various types based on
duction methods:

ey Hydrogen: Produced from fossil fuels, typically
ural gas, with associated carbon emissions.

jue Hydrogen: Also derived from fossil fuels but
ith carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to
educe emissions.

een Hydrogen: Generated through the electrolysis
f water using renewable energy sources like solar or
ind power, resulting in zero emissions.

rown Hydrogen: Produced from coal, with signifi-
ant carbon emissions.

Turquoise Hydrogen: A newer concept, turquoise
ydrogen is generated using methane pyrolysis, poten-
ally with carbon capture to minimize emissions.

ink Hydrogen: Produced using nuclear energy.

| cells are advanced electrochemical devices that uti-
_ hydrogen as their primary fuel source. They directly
vert chemical energy into electricity and heat. They
’t involve the combustion of fossil fuels, so they are
lean and sustainable energy technology. Normally,
rogen can be produced through an electrolyte where
gen is also formed.

Other points of fuel cells are as follows:

Versatile Fuel Use: Fuel cells can operate on a variety
of fuels including hydrogen, natural gas, methanol,
and biogas.

Hydrogen as a Key Component: In many types of
fuel cells, hydrogen is the primary and most efficient
fuel used. This does not add to GHG emissions.
‘Reforming Process’ for Alternative Fuels: Fuels
like natural gas, methanol, and biogas are converted
into hydrogen through a process called reforming,
which involves a chemical reaction with steam and a
catalyst.

Specific Process for Methanol: In the case of metha-
nol, steam reforming or methanol reforming is used
to produce hydrogen for fuel cells.

Versatile Applications: Fuel cells have found appli-
cations in various sectors, including space explora-
tion, where their reliability and efficiency are crucial.
Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs): They represent
a promising solution for reducing urban air pollution.
These vehicles use fuel cells to power electric motors,
offering a clean alternative to traditional internal
combustion engines.

verall, fuel cells demonstrate the potential for diversify-
§ energy resources beyond traditional fossil fuels.

Sorar Enercy

Solar energy is one of the most renewable and sustainable
sources of energy. That’s why it is important for our energy
security. We need to see how does Sun produces its own energy.

Law of Conservation of Energy: This law has two parts
—law of Transformation and Energy Balance. This law pri-
marily states that energy cannot be created or destroyed;
it can only transformed from one form to another. The
balance of energy is to be maintained.

Fusion and Fission: The nuclear processes involved in the
production of energy have been briefly discussed below:

1. Nuclear Fusion Process: This happens In the core of
Sun where hydrogen atoms undergo nuclear fusion. The
hydrogen nuclei (protons) are fused together to form
helium. Some mass is lost that releases a significant
amount of energy. This is the prime source of energy.

2. Proton-Proton Chain Reaction: The four hydrogen
nuclei are combined through a series of steps to ulti-
mately form a single helium nucleus.

The point to be noted that the initial hydrogen nuclei and
the final helium nucleus is converted into energy accord-
ing to Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence principle (E =
mc?). We can observe this through the Sun’s luminosity.

Then shifting the scene to the ground. Sun is the ulti-
mate source of energy for Earth. This energy on earth
comes in two forms — directly and indirectly.

Direct Use or So_tar Power

¢ Through Photosynthesis: That end product is Food
which is then eaten by animals and humans, provid-
ing us with energy.

e Photovoltaic (PV) cells: These cells use a semicon-
ductor material to absorb light and generate elec-
tron-hole pairs. These electron-hole pairs are then
collected by electrical contacts to create an electric
current. These cells are common, and are relatively
simple and inexpensive to produce.

How a solar power system works?

1. Sunlight hits the solar panels and is converted into

direct current (DC) electricity.

DC electricity is then passed through the inverter,

which converts it into alternating current (AC)

electricity.

3. The AC electricity can then be used to power your
home or business, or it can be stored in batteries for
later use.

4. If you have a grid-connected solar system, any excess
electricity that you generate can be sold back to the
utility company.

Photo Electro Chemical (PEC) Solar Cells

e PEC solar cells generate electricity using a semicon-
ductor and an electrolyte.

¢ Light creates electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor.

e Electron-hole pairs trigger an electrochemical reac-
tion in the electrolyte.

e This reaction produces electricity collected by the
semiconductor and electrolyte.

e PEC solar cells can produce renewable hydrogen via
water splitting, yielding hydrogen and oxygen gases.

2

Concentrated Solar Power (CSP): CSP uses mirrors or
lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver. This heat
can then be used to generate electricity or to produce
other forms of energy, such as hydrogen fuel.

Organic Photovoltaics (OPV): This technology uses
organic (carbon-based) materials as semiconductors to
convert sunlight into electricity. OPV solar cells are flex-
ible and lightweight, and they can be produced at a rela-
tively low cost. However, they are also less efficient than
traditional silicon-based solar cells.

Inpinect Use or Sotar Power

¢ Fossil Fuels: Coal, oil, and natural gas come from
decayed plants and animals, which originally got
energy from the sun.

° Hydropower: Water movement generates power.
The sun evaporates ocean water, causing rain or
snow. This flows into rivers, turning turbines to make
electricity.

e Wind Power: Wind is created by the sun heating the
Earth unevenly, causing air to move. This wind move-
ment generates power.

India as a Major Solar Power

The following factors contribute to this:

¢ Location of India: India is located in Northern
Hemisphere, with the Tropic of Cancer passing
through its central region, that divides India into
two equal parts. Many regions in India enjoy more
than 300 sunny days per year, ideal for solar power
generation.

¢ Technological Advancements: There has been

‘development of more efficient solar panels, solar

storage solutions, and innovative applications i
solar-powered irrigation and transportation,

1. Cost Reduction: This has been achieved through ,
icy support, increased manufacturing capacity
technological advancements. The capacity expang, )
has taken place through big projects.

2. Government Initiatives: The National Solar Mis.
(NSM), part of the National Action Plan on Climag,

Change, aims to establish India as a global leade
solar energy. There are ambitious targets and th
execution. The initial NSM target of 20GW that
set in 2010 was revised to 1OOGW in 2015. The]
projects were set up.
India became a partner nation with France ;
International Solar Alliance in 2015. This has bee
discussed later also. This significant partnership wa
announced during the COP21 Paris summit.

3. Challenges: Despite the rapid growth, there are cha
lenges such as land acquisition, grid connectivi¢
storage solutions and financial constraints for larg
scale projects. There is requirement of robust ener
storage solutions and grid management to ensure.
steady supply of electricity.

ino ENERGY

nd turbines harness the power of the wind to generate
tricity. This happens in the following manner:

Wind Capture: Wind turbines have large blades that
catch the wind. A minimum wind speed of 15 kmph is
required for wind energy farms. This scene depends
upon the Earth’s natural wind patterns.

Mechanical Energy Conversion: When the wind
blows, it pushes on the blades, making them spin.
Generation of Electricity: The spinning blades turn
- ashaft inside the turbine.

“Transmission of Electricity: The shaft is connected
to a generator, which creates electricity from the spin-
ning shaft’s movement.

Integration into the Power Grid: The electricity gen-
erated is fed into the power grid, where it is distrib-
uted for use in homes, businesses, and other facilities.

(60 meters) and towers reaching over 260 feet (80
meters) high. They can power thousands of homes.
Netherlands, with over 1,600 windmills is called as
the ‘land of windmills’.

These are as follows:

1. Wind energy is infinite and sustainable Resource.
This may work 24x7 depending upon weather pat-
tern. Wind turbines can be located onshore (on land)
or offshore (in bodies of water). Offshore turbines
tend to be larger and can capture more wind due to
less obstruction and higher wind speeds over water.
This is environmentally friendly as there is no pol-
lution or GHG emissions. This is a cleaner air and a
reduced carbon footprint.

This is scalable as there is a viable option for meeting
growing energy demands.

This is versatile as there is scope of mechanical energy
for tasks such as pumping water or grinding grains.
Land Multifunctionality is there as the land around
windmills can be used for farming, allowing for a
dual-use of the space.

country:

The largest wind turbines blades are over 200 feet .

Limitations: Many challenges are there as were in Solar.
In addition

° Wildlife Impact: Wind turbines can pose a threat to
certain wildlife species, particularly birds and bats,
through collisions or habitat disruption.

e Noise Pollution: There may be non stop noise pollu-
tion in case wind mill is operative.

e Land Requirement: This may be an issue in popu-
lated regions.

° Maintenance Costs: Maintaining and servicing wind
turbines can be costly, impacting the overall economic
feasibility of wind energy systems.

The major wind producing nations in the world are China,
United States, Germany, India, Spain and Brazil.

According to the Ministry of New and Renewable
Energy (MNRE), the five top wind energy producing
states in India in 2022-23 are: Tamil Nadu, Gujarat,
Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Karnataka.

Note: Karnataka (29%), Rajasthan (20%), Tamil Nadu
(18%), Andhra Pradesh (16%), and Gujarat (14%) are
the top five states in terms of solar and wind energy con-
tribution to their total energy production.

HypDROELEcTRIC POWER

This is basically harnessing the ‘Energy of Water’. The
hydropower is a renewable energy source that generates
electricity from the movement of water. It utilizes the
natural water cycle, which is constantly replenished by
rainfall and snowfall.

Conversion of Energy: The solar energy results in the
flow of water.

The key components of hydroelectric power project
are dams (reservoirs of water), waterwheels for storing
water. Then turbines are turned with flow of water.

We can see the energy conversion from the following
points:

1. Gravitational Energy: Water stored in a reservoir
at a high elevation possesses gravitational potential
energy, that is due to pull of gravity.

2. Potential Energy Conversion into Kinetic Energy:
Once the water is released from the reservoir and
starts coming down, the potential energy is converted
into kinetic energy.

3, Kinetic Energy: As the water flows downward, it gains
speed, and its kinetic energy increases with the more
downward flow of water. This rotates the turbines.

4. Turbine Rotation: The rotational motion of the tur-

bines represents mechanical energy. That is trans-

ferred to generators through a shaft connection.

Electricity Generation: Inside the generators, the

mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy

through a process called electromagnetic induction.

vi

The generated electricity is then transmitted through
power lines to homes, businesses, and industries for vari-
ous uses.

The key factors for energy production are water flow,
volume of water (reservoir), and the height of the fall
(head) determine electricity generation.

india’s Capacity and Projects

Hydropower is a major contributor to India’s renewable
energy, with significant installed capacity. The five big-
gest projects in India are given below:

1. Koyna Hydroelectric Project (Koyna River, Maha-
rashtra) - 1,960 MW.

2. Nathpa Jhakri Hydroelectric Power Station (Satluj
River, Himachal Pradesh) - 1,500 MW.

3. Sardar Sarovar Dam (Narmada River, Gujarat)

_ -1,450 MW

4. Bhakra Nangal Dam (Sutlej River,
Pradesh) - 1,325 MW

5. Tehri Dam (Bhagirathi River, Uttarakhand) -1,000 MW

These projects help in irrigation and flood control.

Himachal

Hydropower in India

e This power is the India’s largest renewable energy
source, that accounts for 12.3% of its total utility
power generation capacity.

e India has an installed hydroelectric power capacity of
46,000 MW as of 31 March 2023.

¢ This power potential is estimated at 148,700 MW,
ranking 5th globally.

e This power generation in India is growing rapidly,
with 156 TWh generated in the fiscal year 2019-20.

e India is committed to expanding its hydroelectric
power capacity to 175 GW by 2027.

Challenges

The loss to environment is in the form of potential floods,
biodiversity loss, fish migration issues, silt accumulation.
Dams impact fish migration and may cause floods and
biodiversity loss. Hydroelectric power is environmentally
friendly but requires careful management for long-term
viability. Hydroelectric power is environmentally friendly
but requires careful management for long-term viability.
Aging infrastructure, sedimentation are the issues.

GEOTHERMAL ENERGY

1, Geothermal Energy Source: Comes from Earth’s
natural heat, often near hot springs.

2. Core Heat Utilization: Uses heat from Earth’s core,
visible as hot springs and geysers.

3. Electricity Generation: Hot water and steam from
geothermal areas power turbines to create electricity.

Methods for Harnessing Geothermal Energy

1. Dry Steam Power Plant: This method utilizes the
direct flow of high-pressure steam from underground
reservoirs to turn turbines and generate electricity.

2. Flash Cycle Plant: In this approach, pressurized hot
water is extracted from geothermal reservoirs, caus-

. ing it to ‘flash’ into steam, which is then used to pro-
duce electricity.

3. Binary Cycle Power Plants: These systems trans
heat from geothermal fluids to a secondary fluid wit
a lower boiling point. The secondary fluid vaporize
and drives a turbine, producing electricity.

Important Points
¢ Geothermal energy is still in the experimental phag,
in India.

e India has significant untapped geothermal potentia}

estimated at over 10,000 MW.

e Geothermal resources in India are spread across seve,

provinces: Himalayas, Sohana, West Coast, Cambay, Son,
Narmada-Tapi (SONATA), Godavari, and Mahanadi.

.° Geothermal energy offers a promising approac

_ for sustainable power generation in India and othe

regions, utilizing the Earth’s natural heat reservoirs t

address rising energy demands.

Ethanol

Ethanol, produced from crops like corn, sugarcane, an
wheat, is renewable. This is made by fermenting sugar
or starches in these crops. Ethanol is an alcohol that j
used as a biofuel. This is blended with gasoline to lowe
carbon emissions in transportation. Thus, ethanol offers,
greener option compared to conventional petrol.

1. Brazil’s Policy: Mandates blending 27 to 30% etha.
nol with gasoline.
2. India’s Biofuel Goal: Aims for 20% ethanol in petro
(E20) and 5% biodiesel (E05) in diesel by 2030,.a
per the National Policy on Biofuels (2018).
3. Energy Security: Ethanol reduces the oil imports
thus enhances energy independence.

Comparison with Petrol (or Gasoline): Ethanol ha
lower energy content compared to gasoline, meanin
more ethanol is needed to produce the same energy. Tha
is linked with energy density.

But Ethanol combustion emits fewer greenhouse gase:
than gasoline, aiding in climate change mitigation.

Higher ethanol blends require modifications in trad
tional gasoline engines.

Biodiesel in National Biofuel Policy

1. National Biofuel Policy Feedstocks: Encompasse
a wide range of materials like sugarcane, maize, so
ghum, sweet potato, cassava, tapioca, algae, municip
solid waste, agricultural residues, and animal waste.

2. Ethanol Production: Involves fermenting sugars of
starches found in feedstocks like sugarcane and maize.

About Biodiesel

1. The Main Feedstocks for Biodiesel are oilseeds like
soybean, rapeseed (canola), sunflower, palm oil, an
jatropha.

* Used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats are also.
sources.
* Algae is another potential feedstock.

2. Jatropha is a non-food, drought-resistant plant, ideal
for biodiesel production.



=== Page 29 ===
Biodiesel composition is possible in the following ways:
« Made with fatty acid methyl esters.
« Blended with diesel for use in engines.

e choice of biodiesel feedstock varies regionally, based
availability and suitability.

FLeEx Fue. Ano Hysrip Evectric VeHIcLes
(HEVs)

A flex-fuel engine is an internal combustion engine
capable of running on a blend of gasoline and etha-
nol, with a maximum ethanol content of 85% (E85).
E85 is the official name for flex-fuel. It has 85 per-
cent ethanol fuel and 15 percent gasoline or other
hydrocarbon by volume.

Note that ethanol is a biofuel derived from plants
like corn or sugarcane.

Fuel Adjustment: Flex-fuel engines are designed
to adapt their fuel-air mixture and timing to accom-
modate the different properties of gasoline and eth-
anol. This adaptability allows them to run smoothly
| on various blends of the two fuels.

Regional Variations: Flex-fuel engines are more
prevalent in certain parts of the world, notably the
United States, where E85 fuel stations are widely
available. In contrast, they are less common in
| regions like Europe and Asia.

|. The Environmental Benefits: There will be reduced
GHGs courtesy ethanol. There will be reduced reli-
ance on foreign oil, so import bills are cut, specially
in India. The farmers get additional income.

Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs)

A hybrid car is a type of vehicle that uses a combi-
nation of two or more power sources, typically an
internal combustion engine (ICE) and an electric
motor. There are two variants:

Parallel hybrid car: Here, the driver has the option
to choose from three combinations — hybrid, ICE or
Power Motor. In series option.

Series hybrid cars: In a series hybrid car, the elec-
tric motor is the primary power source, and the ICE
acts as a generator to charge the battery.

Overall, hybrid cars offer the benefits of saving
money on fuel, quieter operations, reduced main-
tenance cost and less emissions. The fuel economy
benefits us if electric power is less costly but used
more. ICE is used less time when it is actually
required at the times of higher acceleration. Even}
when ICE is in operation, electric power will be pro-
duced. Thus, overall fuel cost will be less.

BioMASS

Biomass basically refers to organic materials derived
from plants and animals. These materials can be used
as a source of energy.

Biomass includes things like wood, crop residues
(like corn stalks), and even things like manure from
animals.

This is assumed to be a renewable energy source
as they can always grow. This is carbon-neutral in
nature. This doesn’t emit greenhouse gases.

Biomass is a part of the National Biofuel Policy of India.

Nuctear ENERGY

Nuclear energy is dense energy. This is derived from the
mass of atomic nuclei converted into energy. As discussed,
the required nuclear reactions happen in two forms -
nuclear fission (splitting of atomic nuclei) or nuclear
fusion (combining of atomic nuclei).

Einstein’s Formula: Discussed earlier, this formula
is a principle behind nuclear energy, Albert Einstein’s
equation E = mc’, where ‘E’ is the Energy produced, ‘m’
is the nuclear mass and ‘c’ represents the speed of light in
a vacuum.

Thus, a small amount of mass can be converted into

a large amount of energy. Ultimately, this energy is then
harnessed to generate electricity, typically by heating
water to create steam that drives turbines.

Major Parts of a Nuclear Reactor

1.

2.

Fuel Rods: Contain fissile materials like uranium-235
or plutonium-239 for nuclear fission.

Control Rods: Made of neutron-absorbing materials
such as boron, hafnium, or cadmium to regulate the
nuclear reaction.

Moderator: Substances like water, heavy water, or
graphite slow down neutrons to facilitate fission.
Coolant: Often water, but can be heavy water, liquid
sodium, or carbon dioxide gas, used to remove heat
from the reactor core.

Containment Vessel: Constructed from steel and
reinforced concrete to contain radiation and with-
stand extreme pressures.

Nuclear Fuels used by India

1.

Natural uranium: The most common type, it is used
in pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs), which
account for over 70% of India’s nuclear power genera-
tion capacity.

2. Enriched uranium (EU): This is used in light water
reactors (LWRs). Natural uranium is composed
of approximately 0.72% U-235 and 99.28% ura-
nium-238 (U-238), a non-fissile isotope. EU is a form
of uranium in which the proportion of uranium-235
(U-235), the ‘fissile isotope’, has been increased rela-
tive to its natural abundance. Enriching uranium
means increasing the concentration of U-235 to a
level sufficient to sustain a nuclear chain reaction.
EU can be of two types:

Low EU: This contains between 3% and 20% U-235.
This is used in common nuclear power reactors.
Highly EU: The percentage of U-235 is often greater
than 20%. This may be used for research and nuclear
weapons. This has stringent controls.

Depleted Uranium: The waste uranium is known as
depleted uranium which is to be safely disposed off in
stable geological formations, such as granite or clay
or spent fuel casks.

Mixed Oxide Fuel (MOX): Plutonium is used in MOX
fuel, which is a blend of plutonium and uranium,
and can be used in certain types of nuclear reactors
to produce energy. MOX fuel is used in prototype
fast breeder reactors (PFBRs). Plutonium has a high
energy density and can provide fuel for long periods,
making it efficient for long-term energy generation.
Plutonium can be used to make nuclear weapons also.
Thorium as a Nuclear Fuel in India: India has abun-
dant reserves of thorium, this fertile material that can
be converted into fissile uranium-233. They are yet to
see commercial success. India is the largest producer
of thorium in the world, that is found in monazite

sand. Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha
have the largest thorium reserves. Brahmaputra river
basin and the Khasi Hills also have rich monazite (and
thus thorium) deposits. Assam, Arunachal Pradesh,
Meghalaya, and Nagaland are the popular NE states,

Use of Heavy Water in Nuclear Reactors: There is pro-
duction of neutrons during uranium fission process, they
needed to be slowed down for further nuclear fuel (usu-
ally uranium) fission. Heavy water performs that function.
Slows down neutrons produced during the fission process.

A big nuclear power plant might release extra heat into
a nearby river or lake. This can make the water too warm,
which is harmful to fish and other creatures living in the
water.

There are basically two types of activities:

1. Natural Interaction: These occur in the natural man-
ner as some basic aspects have been discussed earlier.
The ecology, ecosystems, biomes, biospheres, atmo-
spheric layers etc. are all natural.

2. Anthropogenic Activities: This stage is marked by
‘Anthropocene era’. This suggests that there is a pro-
posed geological epoch that recognizes the signifi- .
cant impact humans have had on Earth’s geology and 7
ecosystems. These developmental activities initially
aimed to improve human living standards, we have
advancements in technology and medicine. We can
have a look in the following manner:

1. Origin of Life: Life started with single-cell organ-
isms around 3 billion years ago.

2. Atmospheric Changes Over Time: There has been
a gradual change in levels of gases like oxygen and
carbon dioxide over this extensive period with evo-
lution, diversity of life, and also population growth.

3. Global Warming, Pollution and Climate Change:
There were phenomena of industrialization, urban-
ization, deforestation etc. The situation worsened
with increase in emission of Green House gases
which were heat trapping and led to global warming.

4. Scale and Duration of Changes: These environ-
mental changes have grown from being local to
having a global impact and have shifted from being
short-term disturbances to long-term challenges.

Impact OF ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES ON
AGRICULTURE

The main impacts on traditional agriculture include
deforestation (clearing forests for farming), soil erosion
(loss of topsoil from wind or water and depletion of nutri-
ents (overuse leads to less fertile soil).



=== Page 32 ===
9.32

The other key issues are:

1. Micronutrient Imbalance: Too much nitrogen, phos-
phorus, and potassium.

1. Nitrate Pollution: Nitrates seep into the soil
and contaminate groundwater. When their con-
centration exceeds 25 mg/L, they can cause
health issues such as blue baby syndrome or
methemoglobinemia.

Eutrophication: The issue is primarily caused by
the excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorus fer-
tilizers in agriculture.

Figure 9.16 Impact of Anthropogenic Activities

* This process has harmful consequences, dam-
aging aquatic ecosystems and affecting water
quality.

* The poor water quality resulting from this issue
can be harmful to both wildlife and humans.

2. Pesticide Usage and Irrigation Challenges in
Agriculture: Pesticides, including herbicides, insec-
ticides, and fungicides, come in various forms: inor-
ganic, synthetic, or biological (biopesticides). These
are used to control pests and diseases in crops, but
they vary in their environmental impact.
Waterlogging: This is caused due to agricultural
practices such as excess irrigation, where soil is overly
saturated with water, that hinders plant growth.

Soil salinity: The high levels of soluble salts in the
soil, often as the result of the over-irrigation or poor
drainage, negatively affect crop health and yield.

Cancer Risk from Metals: Arsenic, cadmium, chro-
mium, and nickel-in construction materials. These
increase the risks of lung, skin, and other cancers.
Formaldehyde: They are emitted from pressed wood
products. They cause respiratory problems and some
cancers.

Benzene: This is commonly found in glues, paints,
and some plastics, benzene is a carcinogen that can
cause blood disorders, including various forms of leu-
kemia. Long-term exposure, even at low levels, can

increase the risk. activi

Trichloroethylene: This is used in cleaning products.
This can cause liver and lung cancers, and non-Hodg-
kin lymphoma.

Ozone: Ozone, particularly at ground level, is a reac-
tive gas that can be harmful to health. It is often gen-
erated by electronic equipment such as copiers and
laser printers. This can cause respiratory such as
asthma and lung diseases.

Health Risks from Air Conditioning: The growth
of bacteria and mould in AC systems can pose health
risks. These microorganisms can lead to various respi-
ratory issues.

Legionnaires’ Disease: A severe pneumonia-like
illness caused by bacteria found in AC systems.
Symptoms include coughing, shortness of breath,
fever, muscle aches, and headaches.
Asbestos-Related Diseases: Asbestos is a group
. of naturally occurring silicate minerals with thin,
fibrous crystals. They are widely used in construction
for insulation, roofing, and fireproofing. They are
known for resistance to heat, electricity, and chemical
corrosion. Their inhalation can cause mesothelioma,
asbestosis, and lung cancer.

Allergies from Pests: These occur particularly from
cockroach droppings, dust mites; and rodent dan-
der. These allergens can trigger allergic reactions and
asthma in sensitive individuals.

EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION ACTIVITIES ON
NVIRONMENT

. Emission of Gases: Transportation releases gases like
lead, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO,),
methane (CH,), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrous oxide
(N,O), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), perfluorocar-
bons (PFCs), heavy metals, and particulates into the
atmosphere.

Ozone Layer Depletion: Nitrous oxide contributes to
the depletion of the ozone layer, which protects the
Earth from harmful UV radiation.

Greenhouse Effect: CO, CO,, and CH, contribute to
the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming.
Acid Rain: The interaction of CO, NO,, SO,, NOx
with water vapor in the atmosphere leads to acid
rain, which can damage buildings, harm crops, and
degrade forests.

- Noise Pollution: Prolonged exposure to noise levels
above 75 dB from transportation can impair hearing
and affect physical and psychological health.

Errects of ANTHROPOGENIC Minine Activities

Mining is done primarily to extract minerals, metals, and
other valuable materials from the earth. They can be used
for manufacturing, construction, energy production, and
echnology. Land dredging (creating holes in land) and
tiver dredging (moving along a river on a platform or
s of leu- boat).

an. * : ane
els, ¢ 1. Deforestation: A primary consequence of mining

activities.

9.33

2. Chemical Usage: Use of harmful chemicals like cya-
nide and mercury in mineral extraction.

3. Land and Water Damage:
* Degradation of vegetation and landscape

alteration.

¢ Land subsidence and a damage (e.g.,
building cracks).

* Groundwater contamination by sulphuric acid
and heavy metals.

° Surface water pollution affecting aquatic life,
including potential radioactive contamination.

4. Air Pollution and Health Hazards: Separate issues
like air pollution and occupational health risks (asbes-
tosis, silicosis, black lung disease) for miners.

5. Uranium Mining: Uranium ore emits radon gas and
other radioactive elements. Prolonged exposure to
high levels of radiation can increase the risk of lung
cancer and other health issues.

Environmental issues need a global approach with ‘com-
mon future’ or ‘global sharing’ concepts. Economic
inequalities affect sustainable development worldwide.
Environmental concerns differ between developed and
developing countries:

1. Local Issues: Such as water shortages, soil erosion,
pollution levels, and landslides.

2. Regional Issues: Include desertification, droughts,
floods, soil erosion, sea-level rise, and deforestation.

3. Global Issues: Climate change, global warming,
the North-South divide, and loss of biodiversity are
critical.

Agenda 21: This agenda tried to address many environ-
mental issues so that is better alignment among different
nations for sustainable development. This included differ-
ences between North (developed) and South (less devel-
oped) Nations. North has technology and capital and
South has mineral and other resources. It acknowledges
the fact that most of global environmental degradation is
caused by North, South is more vulnerable to these envi-
ronmental issues.

° Thus, the principle of ‘common but differentiated
responsibilities’ is central to Agenda 21. Though all
nations have to take responsibility in environmental
protection, but developed countries have a larger role
to play due to their historical role as industrialisation,
urbanisation started in the North nations.

¢ The North has to take responsibility of technology
transfer and financial assistance. There is a felt need
to enhance the participation of developing countries
in the global economy. Their growth should become
sustainable and equitable.

° There is need to make sustainable consumption pat-
terns across the world. An integrated approach is
required towards the issues of environment, sustain-
ability, economy and poverty reduction.

Rove oF CO, in Cumate CHANGE

Carbon dioxide enjoys a separate status due to its green-
house gas status, long term impact, different regulatory
framework, and sources and emission control. It may
seem that whole unit is built around this.

1. Increase in Atmospheric CO, Concentration: The
concentration of CO, in the atmosphere increased
significantly due to anthropogenic activities. The
excessive use of fossil fuels played its own role. This
level has reached 418 ppm now in 2023. During pre-
industrial era in 1850's, it was 280 ppm. Thus, there
is almost a 50% increase the concentration.

2. Enhanced Greenhouse Effect: CO, acts as a green-
house gas, which trap the heat around the earth. The
increased use has resulted in an average global tem-
perature rise of 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels so
far.

3. Consequences of Climate Change: The above

resulted in extreme weather patterns, disruption of

ecosystems, sea rise and harmful ocean acidification,
rapidly melting ice, severe cyclones, biodiversity loss.

Mitigation Efforts: They started in the forms of Kyoto

Protocols, Paris Agreements etc to limit carbon emis-

sions. Then efforts started in the form of renewable

energy, reforestation etc.

Pollution is the introduction of harmful substances or
energy into the environment, resulting in adverse effects
on the environment, human health, or the quality of life.
These harmful substances, known as pollutants, can be
physical, chemical, or biological in nature. They can be
introduced into the environment intentionally or uninten-
tionally, through human activities or natural processes.

Pollutant Levels: As pollutants have toxic effects, their
toxicological assessment levels have been given below.
They help in setting safety standards:

° NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Level): Used
to set safe exposure limits and derive the Benchmark
Dose (BMD), which estimates the dose causing a spe-
cific level of effect in a population.

* LD5O (Lethal Dose, 50%): Utilized to classify sub-
stances according to the Globally Harmonized System
(GHS) hazard class, indicating the dose lethal to 50%
of test subjects.

* LOAEL (Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level):
Helps derive the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), the
daily intake amount over a lifetime without causing
adverse effects.

® NOEFF (No Observed Effect Level): Used to estab-
lish the Reference Dose (Rf£D), the amount that can be
inhaled daily over a lifetime without adverse effects.

The main pollution types have been discussed below:

Air PoLtuTtion

World Health Organization (WHO) defines air Pollution
as ‘the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environ.
ment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that
modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere,

This definition encompasses a wide range of pollut.
ants, including gases like sulphur dioxide (SO,), nitrogen
oxides (NO,), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (0,), as
well as particulate matter (PM), both PM10 and PM2.5
(particulates with diameters of 10 micrometers and 2.5
micrometers, respectively).

WHO definition includes diverse sources such as indus.
trial activities, vehicles, and natural processes. Pollution
affects both indoor and outdoor environments. This can
lead to alterations in the atmosphere. There is human
contribution in the form of human roles in causing air
pollution.

Pure Gases

The basic idea about pure gases is important as we can
compare them with pollutant gases for differentiation.

° Noble Gases: Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar),
Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), Radon (Rn) - characterized
by their chemical inertness (inactivity) due to a full
valence electron shell.

° Elemental Gases: Hydrogen (H2), Oxygen (O,),
Nitrogen (Nz), Chlorine (Cl,)-consist of diatomic mol-
ecules with two atoms of the same element.

* Other Gases: Carbon Dioxide (CO), Nitrous Oxide
(N20), and Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF,) are also con-

sidered pure gases.

Types of Air Pollutants: There are two main kinds of ait.
pollutants:

i. Primary Pollutants: These come straight from places
like cars and factories.

« Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) or
Particulate Matter (PM): Tiny particles sus-
pended in the air. (discussed below)

* Oxides of Carbon: Includes carbon monoxide
and carbon dioxide.

¢ Hydrocarbons: Methane and other organic
compounds.

« Sulphur Oxides (SOx)

e« Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)

e CFCs: Chlorofluorocarbons, harmful to the ozone
layer.

¢ Lead: Heavy metal pollutant

articulate Matter (PM): SPM or PM includes soot (incom-
jete burning of organic matter), smoke (fires, industry,
ehicles), dust (natural), fibres (textiles, construction),
ticides, metals (such as mercury, lead and copper), dust
ites (microorganisms) and pollen (air born plant parti-
es). They are more dangerous as they penetrate deeper.

. PM 2.5: Particles with a diameter of 2.5 micro meters
(or say it as pm) or less can penetrate deep into the
lungs.

. PM10: Particles with a diameter of 10 pm or less.
Includes dust, pollen, and mould.

. PM 1: Ultrafine particles with a diameter of 1 jm or
less. They can enter the bloodstream leading to respi-
ratory and cardiovascular issues.

. Total Suspended Particulate Matter (TSPM): They
encompasses all airborne particles, regardless of size.

2. Secondary Pollutants: These don’t come directly
from a source. Instead, they form in the air when pri-
mary pollutants react with other things. Examples
include acid rain and smog. The major air pollutions,
acid rain, smog have been discussed below:

Masor Air PoL_utions
1. Ozone (Ground Level)

Source: Formed by reactions between nitrogen
oxides and volatile organic compounds from
vehicular exhaust, in sunlight.

Health Effects: Aggravates lung diseases like
asthma, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis.

2. Lead

Source: Previously used in leaded petrol as an
anti-knocking agent.

Health Effects: Affects the central nervous sys-
tem, interferes with red blood cell development.

3. Sulphur Dioxide

e

Source: Emitted by thermal power plants and
various industries.

Health Effects: Causes severe respiratory prob-
lems and impairs gas exchange in the lungs.

4. Nitrogen Oxides

°

e

Source: Produced by thermal power plants.
Health Effects: Leads to heart and lung issues,
bronchitis, asthma; potential carcinogen.

5. Carbon Monoxide

7.

Source: Results from incomplete combustion of
fossil fuels, wood stoves, and cigarette smoke.
Health Effects: Reduces oxygen-carrying capac-
ity of blood, causing breathing difficulties.

Hydrogen Sulphide

°

Source: Found around oil refineries and chemical
industries.

Health Effects: Causes nausea, eye and throat
irritation.

Hydrogen Cyanide

Source: Emitted from blast furnaces, used in
fumigation and in the chemical industry.

Health Effects: Leads to headaches, dry throat,
blurred vision, and nerve cell dysfunction.

Ammonia

Source: Produced in the fertilizer industry, dye-
making, bleaching, and explosives manufacturing.
Health Effects: At high levels, it can lead to the
acidification of water bodies.

neys, can cause jaundice.
12. Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM)
© Source: Emitted from incinerators and various manu-
facturing processes.
° Health Effects: Leads to respiratory issues like
emphysema, asthma, and chronic bronchitis

Acio Rain

* Acid Rain pH: Natural rainwater has a pH around 5.6

due to dissolved atmospheric carbon dioxide, forming

weak carbonic acid. Acid rain has a pH lower than 5.6.

Source of Acid Rain: Emissions of sulphur dioxide

(SO,) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from sources like

power plants, industries, and vehicles lead to acid

rain. .

° Formation Process: SO, and NOx react with water
vapor, oxygen, and other atmospheric chemicals to
produce sulfuric and nitric acids. Let’s see the exam-
ple of formation of Sulphuric Acid:

Sulphur trioxide (SO3) reacts with water vapor in
the atmosphere to form sulphuric acid (H,SO,). This
reaction is a key step in the formation of acid rain.

* §0,+H,0->H,SO,.

* Formation of Acid Rain:

® Acid rain is formed when sulphuric acid (from
SO3) and nitric acid (formed from nitrogen
oxides) dissolve in atmospheric moisture (like
rain, fog, snow, or even dry particles).

e These acids lower the pH of the precipitation,
resulting in acid rain.

It can harm lakes, rivers, and forests. It damages for-

ests, especially in high places. It makes it hard for

trees and plants to grow and stay healthy

SmoG

Smog is a mix of two words ‘smoke’ and ‘fog.’ It describes a
type of air pollution that is a combination of smoke, dust,
and other particulates with fog. They create a dense layer
of visible air pollution. This is mainly of two types:

Sulphurous Smog (London Smog)

This mainly comprises of sulphur dioxide and PM, which
often originates from coal-rich industrial areas.

Main Trapping Conditions: This mostly occurs in cold,
humid, and windless conditions that trap pollutants close
to the ground.

- cooler air near the ground. This lid of warm gases pre-

An example is the 1952 London smog, caused by gy,
conditions, resulted in a thick layer of smog over the city,

Health Effects: Leads to respiratory issues, worse
asthma, and can cause lung diseases.
‘Environmental Impact: Harms plant life and corrodes
buildings and structures.
Government policies and a shift to cleaner enero,
sources have reduced sulphurous smog, but it can still ocey;
in coal-dependent areas and specific weather conditions.

Ns

Photochemical Smog (Los Angeles Smog)

This smog is a mixture of pollutants, mainly ground leve,
ozone (O,), resulting from sunlight reacting with nitro.
gen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
from vehicle emissions. oe

This ground-level ozone is specifically formed by sun.
light acting on vehicle emission pollutants. This ground
level ozone is dangerous while stratospheric ozone is ben.
eficial as that protects us from UV radiations.

Peroxyacety] Nitrate (PAN): PAN is asecondary pollutant
in photochemical smog. It forms from chemical reactions
involving VOCs and NOx in sunlight. Emissions from vehj-
cles and industries contribute to this pollution. Exposure to
PAN and photochemical smog can worsen respiratory and
jung conditions like asthma and bronchitis. -

Sunlight (Photochemical) Dependence: This forms in
sunny, urban areas with heavy traffic due to the need for
strong sunlight.

Weather Conditions: This appears as a hazy, brownish
cloud. This occurs under hot, sunny conditions with stag-
nant air. :

Health Effects: Irritates eyes, throat, and lungs, exacerbat-
ing conditions like asthma and chronic bronchitis.

Environmental Impact: Harms. crops, vegetation, and
materials like rubber and plastics.

Los Angeles Connection: This connection appears due
to high vehicle emissions and sunny weather contribute to
its prevalence. Now observed in urban areas globally with
increased vehicle usage and sunny climates. a

Winter Smog: The winter smog in Delhi has some simi
larities with photochemical smog. Winter smog is driven
by a temperature inversion when a layer of warm air traps

vents the intermixing of gases. Then dangerous PM 2.5
also mixes up. There are hazy and smoggy conditions
which obscure the visibility.

Overall, winter smog can be particularly dangerous
due to the combination of stagnant air, increased pollu-
tion sources (e.g., heating), and reduced dispersion of
pollutants. That we commonly observe in Delhi during
winter months.

Photochemical smog, on the other hand, is associated
with the chemical reactions between pollutants like nitro:
gen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (voCs)
in the presence of sunlight.

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)

VyOCs are chemicals that can easily turn into vapours
or gases. Examples of common VOCs include formal- |
‘dehyde, benzene, xylene, toluene, and various alco- |
hols. They are found in many everyday products like
paints, varnishes, cosmetics, in building materials 5
such as adhesives, upholstery, wood products, even |
petroleum refining, fuels etc. These compounds can |
escape into the air at room temperature, whichis why @
sometimes you can smell them, like the strong scent &
jn new paint or varnish. :
VOCs can cause the following health damages:

4. Carcinogens: Certain VOCs cause cancer. For &
example, benzene is associated with an increased |
risk of leukemia. Formaldehyde exposure is |
linked to nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia. [

2. Respiratory Diseases: Chronic exposure can @
lead to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease (COPD). a

3. Neurological Disorders: affects central ner-
vous system, memory impairment, lack of coor- |
dination etc. :

4, Liver and Kidney Damage: This may be caused f
by trichloroethylene, that is a industrial solvents. 77

5. Endocrine Disruption: This is basically inter- 3

ference of VOCs with body’s hormonal systems.

Atmospheric haze: This is caused by factors like partic-
ulate matter, dust, and pollution, can occur year-round.
The situation is compounded by the presence of its fine

E PM2.5. The extended exposure to PM2.5-rich haze can
on, an ead to severe health issues.

Government Initiatives to control Air Pollution:
There are specific constitutional articles in the Indian
Constitution, such as Article 48A (Directive Principles of

1. National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP):

* The AQI (Air Quality Index) has six categories,
from ‘Good’ to ‘Severe’, based on pollution levels.
These have been given below:

Good (0 -50 - Green): Minimal impact, air quality is

satisfactory.

Satisfactory (51-100-Yellow): Acceptable air qual-

ity, minor concerns for sensitive individuals.

Moderately Polluted (101-150-—Orange): Acceptable

like individuals with respiratory conditions.

Very Poor (201-300-Purple): Health alert, more
serious effects for everyone.

Severe (301-500-Maroon): Hazardous, emergency
conditions with widespread health effects.

National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS):

* NAAQS were developed by the Central Pollution
Control Board which operates under the Ministry of
Environment, Forest and Climate Change in India.

* NAAQS sets limits for about 12 pollutants. These
pollutants are typically categorized into ‘crite-
ria’ air pollutants, including particulate matter
(PM10 and PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO,), nitro-

gen dioxide (NO,), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone

(O,), and lead (Pb).

° NAAQS includes extra pollutants like arsenic,
nickel, benzene, and benzopyrene. These sub-
stances are known for their carcinogenic and toxic
effects.

¢ NAAQS has a focus on PM2.5 also due to its severe
health risks. These fine particles can penetrate
deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream,
causing cardiovascular, respiratory, and other
health problems.

e Efforts such as cleaner fuels and emission norms
have reduced SO, and NO, levels.

¢ Switching from coal to LPG has helped lower pol-
lution. When burned, coal emits a high level of
pollutants, including particulate matter, sulfur
dioxide (SO,), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and vari-
ous greenhouse gases.

System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting

(SAFAR):

A project by the Ministry of Earth Sciences.

¢ Provides real-time air quality information and
forecasts in major cities.

* Developed by the Indian Institute of Tropical
Meteorology, Pune.

e Also includes weather parameter warnings.

Buarat Stace (BS) Norms

BS norms set by the government control pollutants

from vehicles.

These norms are based on European standards (Euro

norms).

The stages range from Bharat I to VI, with BS VI being

the latest.

Lead was removed from automobile fuel in 2000.

BS VI norms, effective from April 1, 2020, signifi-

cantly reduce pollutants:

* Lower PM 2.5 levels (20 to 40 pg/m? in BS-VI
compared to 120 pg/m? in BS-IV).

e Sulphur content reduced to 10 ppm in BS-VI from
50 ppm in BS-IV, reducing particulate matter
emissions and engine wear.

¢ BS-VI vehicles emit 80% less particulate matter
and 70% less nitrogen oxide per kilometer com-
pared to previous standards.

Indoor Air Pollution

e The primary causes are in the forms of inefficient
burning of fuels like cow dung, agricultural waste,
coal, and wood, especially in poorly ventilated homes.

¢ Problem worsens in winter due to closed doors and
windows, particularly in rural areas.

¢ Smokeless chulhas (stoves) were introduced to reduce
indoor pollution but had limited success.

Wain Methods for Controlling Gaseous

Pollutants

1. Combustion: Organic gases and vapours are burned
to make them less harmful. This process turns pollut-
ants into safer substances and water vapor.

2. Absorption: The main role in absorption is played
by the liquid within the scrubbers. This soaks up
pollutants from gases. The scrubbers have a liq-
uid that removes the pollutants, making the air
cleaner.

3. Adsorption: Here, pollutants stick to the surface of
a solid substance. Gases pass through this solid, leav-
ing the pollutants behind and letting clean air pass
through.

4. Fabric Filters: Dust and other particles in gases are
trapped by passing the gas through fabric filters.

5. Electrostatic Precipitators: These use electrical
charges to remove particles from gases,

6. Domestic Measures: Using cleaner fuels like biogas
instead of wood or dung cakes.

_7. Transportation Measures: Carpooling, using pub-

lic transport, using cleaner fuels, regular vehicle

- maintenance, and turning off engines when not
necessary.

8. Industrial Measures: Installing tall chimneys and

less, odourless, and flammable gas that is the Main
component of natural gas.

Why Methane is so dangerous to us. Methane is
basically a greenhouse gas, meaning that it traps heat
in the atmosphere and contributes to climate chan e
Methane is about 25 times more potent at trapping
heat than carbon dioxide (CO2) over a 20-year periog
as its Global Warming Potential (GWP) is 25. A Gwp
is a measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps
in the atmosphere over a specific period, compared tg
carbon dioxide.

1. Natural Processes: This includes biologicaj
activities and environmental changes.
* Biological Activities: Digestion in the diges.

tive system, photosynthesis in plants, and cel.
lular respiration.
¢ Environmental Changes: Natural events like
weathering, erosion, volcanic eruptions, and
geological processes like plate tectonics.

2. Human Activities: Man-made sources are diverse
and impactful.
¢ Garbage Dumps: Decomposing organic waste

generates methane. :

* Oil and Gas Systems: Leakage and venting
during extraction and processing.

¢ Farming: This happens during rice cultivation
that is basically waterlogged conditions. :

* Coal Mining: Releases methane trapped within
coal layers, that is called as ‘coal bed methane’
(CBM). (Gg

¢ Burning for Energy: Combustion of fossil fuels
and biomass releases methane. |

* Treating Wastewater: The decomposition 0:
organic matter in sewage produces methane...

¢ Factory Processes: Certain chemical and
industrial processes emit methane.

* Methanogens: An interesting natural source of
methane is methanogens, a type of bacteria found
in the digestive systems of animals like cows.

* Solifluction and Melting Arctic Permafrost:
Let’s try to understand this with a question set
in UGC NET Exam, on ‘solifluction’. Solifluction
primarily occurs in permafrost (frozen ground)
in polar or subpolar regions that is affected by
the seasonal temperature variations in the soil
there. When the permafrost thaws (or loos:
ens), there is release of methane. The release
of this GHG warns up the planet by trapping
the heat. This becomes a positive feedback loop
that means more and more release of methane:
The students can refer to Green House Gases
Emission in the later part.



=== Page 39 ===
4. Feedback Loop: Methane release increases with
global warming, which in turn accelerates further
methane release.

5. Rising Levels: Over the past two decades, atmo-
spheric methane levels have risen sharply.

6. Atmospheric Lifetime: Methane remains in the
atmosphere for a shorter duration compared to
carbon dioxide.

7. Climate Impact: Effective reduction of meth-
ane emissions can significantly decelerate global
warming.

8. Major Methane Emitters: Countries like China,
USA, Russia, India, Brazil, and Indonesia are lead-
ing contributors to global methane emissions.

9. Indication of Life on Planets: The presence of
methane on other planets is intriguing because it
can potentially indicate the presence of life, but it
is not definitive proof. The example is Mars.

Ozone (O,)

Ozone, particularly at ground level, is a reactive gas that
can be harmful to health. This can cause respiratory such
as asthma and lung diseases. At stratospheric level, it
works as a protective layer, and saves us from cancer and
cataract.

Formation of Ozone in Stratosphere

Ozone is a triatomic molecule of oxygen, that is O,. When
UV radiation strikes an oxygen molecule (O,), it breaks
nto two oxygen atoms.

0,>0+0

These single oxygen atoms are very reactive, they attack
other oxygen molecules and make ozone.

0+0,>0,

Dobson Units (DU): Not getting very technical, One DU
s like having a layer of ozone that’s only about 1.27 mm
or .00127 cms) thick if you could stack all the ozone ina
olumn from the Earth’s surface to the top of the atmos-
here into one thin layer.

Typical Dobson Unit values can range from less than
00 DU in ozone-depleted regions to over 500 DU in areas
with higher ozone levels.

Montreal Protocol: First, we need to get an idea about
he creation of ozone to see how much destruction can be
aused.,

1. Release of Ozone-Depleting Substances (ODS):
Remember from exam point of view that Chloroflu-
orocarbons (CFCs), Halons, Carbon Tetrachloride,
Methyl Chloroform, and Hydrochlorofluorocarbons
(HCFCs) are all classified as Ozone-Depleting Sub-
stances (ODS). These basically consisted of chlorine
and bromine.

Note: Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) was envisaged to
replace ODS listed above but the release of HFC was
found to be dangerous as it proved to be a dangerous
GHG with very high Global Warming Potential (GWP).
The focus on HFC gave a way to Kigali agreement.

2. Generation of Highly Reactive Atoms: The above
go into stratosphere and get broken by UV radiation.
Once they are broken down in the form of highly reac-
tive chlorine and bromine atoms.

3. ‘Catalytic’ Destruction of Ozone: These highly reac-
tive atoms on coming into contact with ozone mol-
ecules, destroy them.

The End Product: The above reactions lead to the forma-
tion of Ozone Holes and there is Increased UV Radiation.
Now UV radiations can directly enter the earth and cause
cancer, cataract and other diseases.

Montreal agreement kept a phasing out schedule for
the gradual elimination of ODS, with different timelines
for developed and developing countries.

Kigali Agreement (2076)

As discussed, HFC a tool to reduce ODS under Montreal
later proved to be dangerous as it adds to global warming.
So, its reduction was mandatory. The reduction in HFCs
may be up to 40% by late 2040s as per Kigali agreement.
The phase-down of HFCs is expected to avoid up to 0.5°C
of warming by the end of the century. The phase out time-
line is as follows:

e Developed countries (mainly EU and USA) commit-
ted to start reducing HFCs as early as 2019.

e Developing countries follow with a staggered time-
line, beginning either in 2024 or 2028.

Water, vital for life, constitutes a significant portion of liv-
ing cells (60-95%). Earth, often called the ‘Water Planet,’
holds a mere 1.2% accessible fresh water, including
ground ice, lakes, and soil moisture. Demand for water is
rising despite its constant volume, compounded by pol-
lution challenges. Indeed, gravity plays a pivotal role in
the formation and flow of waterfalls within watersheds.
The rivers also flow accordingly. The urban areas demand
more water, while less developed regions often struggle
to meet basic needs.

Water pollution, a global concern, affects drinkable water,
lakes, rivers, and oceans. It involves the contamination
of water bodies with harmful substances, rendering the
water unfit for its intended use.

Key Characteristics of Drinking Water Quality

1. Taste and Odor: Water should be palatable — pleasant
taste and no odour. The presence of chlorine (used for
disinfection), algae, some bacteria, sulphates etc. can
cause off-tastes or odours. The temperature of water
can be linked with growth of microorganisms.

2. Colour: The presence of substances like iron, manga-
nese, and certain organic compounds can cause contami-
nation and provide somewhat bad colour to water. There
can be turbidity issues in water due to pathogens etc.

3. Hardness: This happens asa result of high levels of min-
erals like calcium and magnesium. This affects tastes of
water, and cause scaling in pipes and appliances.

4. pH Level: Environment Protect Agency recommends
a range of 6.5 (slightly acidic) to 8.5 (slightly alka-
line) for pH levels in water. Slightly alkaline (a higher
concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) than hydro-
gen ions (H+)) is good for improved digestion, better
hydration, and detoxification. High levels of acidic or
basic may result in corrosion, scaling, and contamina-
tion may be the results.

Dissolved Oxygen and BOD: These have been dis-

cussed under BOD and COD, discussed separately.

6. Nitrate/Nitrite Levels: Their high levels can be par-
ticularly hazardous for infants and pregnant women,
as they can interfere with blood oxygen levels.

7. Chemical Safety: Too much of metals and heavy met-
als are bad for health. WHO recommends the follow-
ing levels per litre.

1.5 mg/L Chromium

Mercury

6 pg/L

Copper

8. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): This refers to the com-
bined content of all organic and inorganic substances
dissolved in water, including minerals, salts, and
some organic matter. TDS affects the taste and quality
of water, with the following general observations:
¢ Low TDS: Water with low TDS levels (below 300

mg/L) may have a flat or insipid taste.

* Moderate TDS: Levels of TDS between 300 to
600 mg/L can enhance the taste of water, making
it more palatable.

* High TDS: When TDS levels exceed 1000 mg/L,
water may develop a bitter, salty, or metallic taste,
and might not be suitable for drinking.

Types of Water PoLLution

1. Point Source Pollution:

* Results from specific discharge locations, like
industrial wastewater and thermal power plant
effluent.

¢ Major sources include:

OxyGeNn ano Water PotiuTion

Oxygen is the basic ingredient for life. Then, how much
amount of oxygen is required to break down chemicals in
the water? When this number is high, it usually means the
water is highly polluted, and that is a bad news for plants
and animals living in it.

Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD):
* BOD measures the amount of oxygen (in an aquatic
system) that microorganisms will consume to break
down organic matter present in water. It also indi-
cates the amount of biodegradable organic material

in water,

Bioaccumulation and Biomagnification mercur
Both are related concepts in environmental science, but metalle

they refer to different processes:

Bioaccumulation: Bioaccumulation is when an organ-
ism absorbs substances, like chemicals or pollutants,
faster than it can excrete or metabolize them. This leads to
a higher concentration of the toxin in the organism than. _
in its environment. For instance, a fish can bioaccumulate
mercury from its water or food.

TERBORNE DISEASES

erborne diseases are illnesses caused by microorgan-
in contaminated water. Their main features vary
wrding to their causative agents:

Bacteria as Causative Agent

Cholera: This causes severe diarrhea and dehydration.
Transmitted through contaminated water or food.
Typhoid Fever: Symptoms include prolonged fever,
headache, nausea, and loss of appetite. Spread
through fecally contaminated water or food.

Virus as a Causative Agent (viral) .

Hepatitis A: Leads to jaundice, abdominal pain, and
fever. Transmitted via contaminated water and food.
Polio: Can cause paralysis and muscle weakness.
_ Spread through contaminated water and food.

, Protozoa as Causative Agent

Giardiasis: Causes diarrhea, gas, and stomach
_cramps. Transmitted through water contaminated
, with the protozoa.

Parasite as Causative Agent

Schistosomiasis: Results in skin rash, fever, and
muscle aches. Contracted through skin contact with
contaminated water.

Metal Contamination-Linked Mostly with Water

Metals normally have a shiny surface, they conduct heat
d electricity, and are malleable (can be hammered into
hin sheets) and ductile (can be drawn into wires). They
nd to lose electrons and form positive ions in chemical
reactions. The examples.are Iron, copper, silver, gold, alu-
Minium, sodium etc.

While heavy metals are a subset of metals character-
ized by their high atomic weight or high atomic number,
and a density at least five times greater than water. Lead,
mercury, cadmium, and arsenic (though technically a
metalloid) are commonly cited examples.

Note: The health issues relating to metals and heavy
Metals fall under both water and solid waste, depending
Upon the context.

Sources of Metal & Heavy Metal Contamination

ndustrial Discharge: Factories involved in mining,
Metal plating, battery manufacturing, tanneries, and

9.41

chemical production often release heavy metals into
water bodies.

Agricultural Runoff: Pesticides and fertilizers can con-
tain heavy metals like arsenic, cadmium, and lead, which
leach into water sources.

Municipal Waste: Improperly managed landfill sites and
sewage can contribute to heavy metal contamination.

Natural Sources: Certain rocks and soils naturally con-
tain heavy metals which can leach into water bodies,
especially in areas of mining activities.

Atmospheric Deposition: Air pollution from industrial
processes can deposit heavy metals into water bodies via
rain.

Impact oF Heavy MevTALS ON HUMAN HEALTH

1. Aluminium: Main Parts Affected: Bones, Kidneys,
Brain, Liver, Musculoskeletal system and Nervous sys-
tem.

Aluminium is a naturally occurring element that is

found in many foods, drinking water, and the envi-

ronment. The blood stream distributes Aluminium to

different body parts.

¢ Aluminium Toxicity: Excessive exposure through
through certain antacids or occupational settings
is associated with neurotoxicity. The potential
effects are:

e Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease:
These are neurodegenerative diseases.

* Bone Loss and Osteoporosis: Aluminium can
interfere with calcium metabolism in bones.

¢ Blood problems: such as anaemia where the
blood does not have enough red blood cells to
carry oxygen throughout the body.

2. Arsenic: Main Parts Affected: Skin, liver, lungs,
bladder
Arsenic is a metalloid, which means it exhibits proper-
ties of both metals and non-metals. This characteristic
influences its behaviour in groundwater. As a metal-
loid, arsenic compounds, including certain acids, can
be more soluble and mobile in aqueous environments
than elemental arsenic. The excess intake through
solubility leads to ‘arsenic poisoning’ which makes
them fatal.

* Skin Problems: hyperpigmentation (darkening
of the skin), hypopigmentation (lightening of the
skin), and the development of skin lesions such
as warts and corns. These skin changes are often

_ referred to as ‘arsenic keratoses.’

¢ Cardiovascular Issues: such as hypertension
and atherosclerosis. ,

* Cancers: such as of skin, lung, bladder.

Cadmium: Main parts affected: Kidneys, lungs,

bones.

Smoking is a direct source of cadmium exposure, and

passive or secondary smoking also contributes to this

exposure.

e Itai-Itai Disease: Itai-Itai disease, known as ‘it
hurts-it hurts’ in Japanese, is characterized by
kidney damage and bone disorders.

¢ Chronic Bronchitis: Cadmium exposure can lead
to chronic bronchitis, a condition characterized
by persistent inflammation and damage to the
airways.

¢ Osteoporosis: Cadmium can disrupt calcium
metabolism in bones, resulting in reduced bone
density.

* Carcinogen: Cadmium is classified as a carcino-
gen, linking it to an increased risk of cancer.

» Chromium: Main Parts Affected: Skin, lungs, respira-

tory system Chromium, particularly in its hexavalent
form (Chromium-6), can have adverse effects on the
body. It primarily affects: .

Skin: skin irritation and dermatitis.

Lungs and Respiratory System: Hexavalent chro-
mium is a known carcinogen resulting in nasal and
sinus cancers.

Gastrointestinal System: A loss to digestion that
results in symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, con-
stipation, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.

. Copper: Main Parts Affected: Liver, kidneys, brain

The copper overload is also called as Wilson’s disease

that is a genetic disorder that results in the accumula-

tion of excess copper in the body. This happens due

to impaired copper metabolism. This can lead to liver

damage, neurological symptoms, and other health

issues.

Iron: The most important physiological function is the

formation of haemoglobin in red blood cells, which is

crucial for oxygen transport. Excess intake of iron can

lead to a condition called iron overload or hemochro-

matosis. Hemochromatosis primarily affects several

parts of the body, including:

¢ Aggravation of Thalassemia: Thalassemia is
a genetic blood disorder that results in the pro-
duction of an abnormal form of haemoglobin or
inadequate production of haemoglobin. This dis-
order leads to excessive destruction of red blood
cells, causing ‘anaemia.’ It aggravates when there
is an additional iron overload in the body, which
is common among thalassemia patients who
undergo regular blood transfusions.

e¢ Organ Damage: There can be organ damage in
the form of liver cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy (heart
muscle disease).

¢ Arrhythmias: There can be issues such as
arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).

¢ Arthropathy: Iron deposition in the joints can
result in joint pain and stiffness, a condition
known as arthropathy. --

e Bronze diabetes: The excessive intake causes
skin pigmentation known as ‘bronze diabetes’.

° Mad Hatter Disease: As name indicates, this
happens in hat makers in the past, charactet-
ized by tremors, emotional disturbances, and
hallucinations.
* Dental Amalgam: Though it is a traditional den-
tal treatment to fill cavities in teeth, some people
are apprehensive of this amalgam which contains
a mixture of mercury, silver, tin, and other metals.
Nickel: Main Parts Affected: Skin, lungs
Some individuals may develop nickel allergy, which
can cause skin rashes and dermatitis when they come
into contact with nickel-containing items like jewel-
lery, clothing fasteners, or certain metal objects.

drinking water. These nitrates convert into ‘nitrites’
once they enter the human body. They can interfere
with the blood’s ability to carry oxygen, causing a lack
of oxygen, which results in a blue tint to the body.
This condition is known as ‘blue baby syndrome’ or
‘methemoglobinemia’.

critical component of terrestrial ecosystems, playing a key
role in water filtration, nutrient cycling, and supporting a
wide range of microbial and animal life.

Main Features of Soil

The soil produces food for all. The following are the main
factors and features of good soil:

1. The Formation of Desirable Quality Soil: This
should be rich in essential components like silicates,
organic material, humus, and clay. The process is
so gradual that it takes thousands of years to form
through natural processes.

2. Dynamic Soil Ecosystem: This is required for proper
thrive, so that it plays a vital role in nutrient cycling.
That includes the absorption of atmospheric nitrogen
in the form of nitrates by nitrifying bacteria, which
are essential for plant growth.

3. Gas Exchange with the Environment: Soil plays a
role in breaking down organic waste and recycling
nutrients back to plants, while also exchanging gases
with the environment.

Soil Horizons

Mature soil is arranged into a series of zones called soil
horizons. The four main soil horizons are:

¢ O horizon: This is the topmost layer of soil and is
made up of freshly fallen leaves, twigs, animal waste,
and fungi.

° A horizon: This layer is made up of partially decom-
posed organic matter (humus) and some inorganic
mineral particles.

° B horizon: This layer is also called subsoil and has
less organic matter and fewer organisms than the A
horizon.

¢ C horizon: This layer is made up of parent material,
which is the material that the soil was formed from.

Types of Soil

We have taken a wholesome view of the soil types in India
from examination point of view. The first six are the most
basic types, the rest four are the popular region wise.

1. Sandy Soil: Found in regions with low rainfall and
well-drained areas, including parts of Rajasthan, Guja-
rat, Punjab, Haryana, and some parts of Uttar Pradesh.

2. Clay Soil: Found in regions with good rainfall, more

prevalent in the eastern and northeastern parts of

India, including parts of West Bengal, Assam, Bihar,

and Odisha.

Silty Soil: Often found in the Indo-Gangetic Plains,

including states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West

Bengal. Also found in delta regions of rivers.

4. Peaty Soil: Typically found in wetlands and marshy
areas in parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and
the northeastern states.

5. Loamy Soil: Relatively widespread in India, found in
various regions, including the Indo-Gangetic Plains,
parts of Central India, and the Deccan Plateau.

6. Chalky Soil: Less common in India but found in hilly
and limestone-rich areas, such as parts of the Himalayan
region and certain regions in the southern states.

7. Alluvial Soil:
¢ Formed due to flooding of plain areas, particu-

larly in lower courses of rivers.

¢ Sedimentary rocks, very fertile, often lacks
humus and nitrogen but rich in potassium.

¢ Suitable for crops like paddy and sugarcane, com-
monly found in the Indo-Gangetic Plains.

8. Red Soil:

* Rich in iron, characterized by its red colour.

¢ Formed from the breakdown of igneous and met-
amorphic rocks.

¢ Found in regions with low rainfall, including
Madhya Pradesh, South Karnataka, Maharashtra,
and Rajasthan.

* Suitable for crops like red gram, groundnut, and
castor seed.

9, Laterite Soil:

* Formed from a mixture of clay and red soil
through a leaching process.

¢ Rich in minerals like aluminium and iron.

* Found in hot and wet tropical areas, includ-
ing parts. of Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats, and
coastal areas.

* Low fertility, hardens upon exposure to air, used
as a building material.

* Suitable for crops like coffee, coconut, and cashew.

10, Regur Soil:

e Also known as black soil or cotton soil, found in
the Deccan Trap region.

¢ Rich in nutrients like calcium, potassium, and
magnesium but low in nitrogen.

¢ Suitable for crops such as cotton, tobacco, oil-
seeds, and maiz

pH Levels of Soils: The questions can be linked with the
pH levels also.

1. Acidic Soils: with pH level below 7. The examples are
sandy soils and some types of peaty soils. The low pH
value is due to the leaching of basic nutrients and the
accumulation of acidic substances over time.

2. Neutral Soils: with pH level of 7. Example is loamy

soils. Soil is neither strongly acidic nor strongly alkaline.

Alkaline Soils: with pH level above 7. Example is

chalky soils which contains a large amount of chalk or

limestone. The alkaline level is due to the presence of
calcium carbonate.

°

Bad Management of Soils

Soil pollution refers to the presence of toxic chemicals,
salts, pathogens, or radioactive materials in soil at levels
harmful to plant growth, human health, and ecosystem
function. The sources of pollution include the following:

}. Deforestation Impact: Deforestation disrupts the
soil ecosystem, leading to adverse effects on soil
health and fertility. So, this must be avoided.

2. Soil Compaction: The use of heavy machinery cg
compact the soil, reducing its porosity and wate
holding capacity.

3. Sewage Water and Heavy Metals: Irrigating fielq
with sewage water or using sewage sludge as fertilize
can increase the heavy metal content in the soil.

4. Crop Rotation Importance: Intensive agricultuy,
practices, without crop rotation, can deplete spec
nutrients from the soil over time.

5. High-Yielding Varieties and Resources: High,

yielding crop varieties often demand more water ang
fertilizers, impacting soil and resource use. Punjab,
Haryana and parts of UP already suffered, there ara

intensive agriculture practices which spoil the land,
6. Salinity and Waterlogging: The use of water wit
high salt content can lead to soil salinity, making th
topsoil impermeable and causing waterlogging issue

7. Pesticides and Fertilizers: Excessive use of pesti.
cides and fertilizers to boost land productivity can.
degrade soil quality and introduce these chemicals

into the ecosystem.
8. Groundwater Overexploitation: Overexploitation

of groundwater can lead to a declining water table.

and contribute to desertification.

health issues.
¢ Loss of biodiversity

* Climate change: This may happen due to release of

greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Prevention of Soil Pollution

1. Sustainable Agricultural Practices: There should be

organic farming methods, rotating crops, and reduc-
ing the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

2. Proper Waste Disposal: To ensure safe disposal and
treatment of industrial and municipal waste.

3. Soil Remediation Techniques: This includes meth-
ods such as bioremediation, phytoremediation, and
soil washing to remove contaminants.

4. Legislation and Policies: Implementing and enforc-

ing environmental regulations to control the dis-

charge of pollutants into the soil.
5. Public Awareness and Education: Informing the

public about the importance of soil conservation and

ways to prevent soil pollution.
6. Industrial Process Modification: Adopting cleanef

production techniques and pollution control mea"

sures in industries.
7. Deforestation Prevention: This maintains soil struc”

Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP)

POPs are persistent, synthetic organic pollutants.
Some POP may be linked with soil pollution as they
get suitable conditions to stay there for longer dura-
tions. POP can be divided into three parts:

| Persistent means staying longer in the environment
without breaking down.

/ Organic means they are carbon based molecules
their structure may involve chlorine, fluorine, or bro-
mine. There is exposure to pesticides; herbicides etc
due to agriculture practices and also industrial wastes

Pollutants means their capability to damage nerv
ous system, immune system cause cancer etc. They
bioaccumulate and biomagnify in the food chain
because they stay longer in the trophic levels. They
are specially dangerous to high trophic levels such
as human beings as they stay in the fatty acids.

There is need for better regulations to avoid thei
intakes into the trophic levels.

1. Nature of Noise: Noise can be random and is gen-
erally considered undesirable and disruptive, unlike
regular sounds.

2. Definition of Noise Pollution: Noise pollution is
environmental noise that harms the body, espe-

It’s unwanted sound that irritates and causes stress,
potentially damaging ear hair cells.

3. Effects of Noise Pollution: Noise pollution not only
impacts hearing but also raises blood pressure, impairs
cognitive function, and leads to chronic stress, affect-
ing overall health,

Measurement of Noise: Noise is measured in decibels
(dB), that was named after Graham Bell, the inventor of the
telephone. This measurement is not linear but logarithmic:

increase represents a tenfold increase in sound inten-
sity. For example, 70 dB is ten times more intense
than 60 dB. An increase from 40 to 80 dB signifies a
10,000-fold rise in loudness.

° Threshold of Hearing: The threshold of hearing is
the quietest sound that the average human ear can
detect, typically around 0 dB. Sounds below this level
are considered inaudible. O decibel represents the
threshold of hearing, correlating to an intensity of 1
X 10°? Watts/m?.

e Threshold of Pain: On the other end of the scale,
the threshold of pain for most people is around 120-
130 dB. Exposure to sounds at or above this level can
cause physical discomfort and hearing damage.

e Sonic Boom: An aircraft flying at or above the speed of
sound generates a shockwave known as a sonic boom.
This creates an extremely loud noise heard on the ground.

e dBA: The decibel-A scale (dBA) is used to measure
noise pollution, and it considers both the intensity
(loudness) and frequency (pitch) of sounds. The
weighting in the dBA scale is designed to mimic the
sensitivity of the human ear to different frequencies.

° Sound power: This is measured in watts (W) and rep-
resents the total energy radiated by a sound source.

As per the Environment Protection Rules, 1999, in India,
the permissible noise level is set at 125 dB. The Central
Pollution Control Board (CPCB) specifies different noise
limits for various zones, both during the day and night:

Industrial areas 75 dB 70GB
Commercial areas 65 dB 55 dB
Residential areas 55 dB 45 dB
‘Silent zones’ near 50 dB 40 dB

schools, hospitals, etc.

Hearing Loss and Masking: WHO recognizes noise as
a significant health hazard in crowded cities. Persistent
exposure to noise, even below 85 dB, can cause permanent
hearing loss, and levels around 130 dB can induce physi-
cal pain. Noise pollution also leads to ‘masking’, affecting
our ability to hear important environmental cues, and can
cause heart rate and breathing pattern changes, irritabil-
ity, headaches, sleeplessness, and decreased productivity.

Silence Zones: Under the Noise Pollution (Regulation
and Control) Rules, 2000 in India, the noise regulations
for silence zones are quite stringent. The silence zones are
areas near educational institutions, vicinity of hospitals,
courts and religious places. The permissible noise levels
in these areas during the daytime (6:00 AM to 10:00 PM)
are up to 50 dB, and during the night time (10:00 PM to
6:00 AM), the limit is up to 40 dB.

RADIOACTIVE POLLUTION

Radioactive pollution refers to the presence of radioac-
tive substances in the environment, which can be harm-
ful to living organisms and the ecosystem. Radiation, the
transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles
through space or a material medium, is categorized into
ionizing and non-ionizing types.

lonizing Radiation
* Includes high-energy radiation like X-rays and gamma
rays.
® Can alter DNA and is harmful due to its ability to ion-
ize atoms and molecules.
° Sources include medical procedures (such as X-rays,
CT scans, and nuclear medicine), nuclear power

plants, and natural sources like cosmic rays and radon
gas from the earth’s crust.

Non-ionizing Radiation
° Low-energy radiation emitted by devices like mobile
phones or radio towers.
° Primarily generates heat and is generally considered

less harmful, but long-term exposure and high inten-
sities may have health implications.

Sources of Radiation

* Most radiation exposure is natural, with radon gas
being a prominent example.

* Human-made sources typically account for about
20% of average radiation exposure.

Effects of Radioactive Pollution
1. UV Radiation: .
¢ A form of ionizing radiation from the sun.
* Essential for vitamin D production but excessive
exposure can cause sunburti and skin cancer.

* Ozone layer depletion increases UV exposure
risks.

tries and medical use, safely disposing of radioactive
waste, monitoring natural radiation, educating the public
on radiation safety, and global treaties to limit releases for
environment and health protection.

Health Impacts:

° Exposure to high levels of ionizing radiatio
cause skin tissue damage and DNA muta
leading to cancers.

* Genetic abnormalities can occur in offspring of
individuals with significant radiation exposure.

* Chronic exposure to low levels of radiation can
also lead to health issues over time.

Environmental Impacts: .

¢ Radioactive pollutants can contaminate air
water, and soil. :

¢ They can persist in the environment for extended
periods, depending on the half-life of the radiog
tive isotopes.

* Impact on wildlife and ecosystems, particularly in
areas of high radioactive contamination.

after use and are harmful to the environment. According

to

the Environment Protection Act, 1990, waste includes

any scrap material or unwanted substance arising from
any process. The Ministry of Environment and Forests
(MoEF) implements India’s Hazardous Wastes Rules.

This term encompasses a wide range of waste types,

each with unique environmental impacts.

The list of wastes includes solid waste, liquid waste,
biodegrade able waste, E-Waste and so on. .
The environmental Impacts includes pollution,
resource depletion, GHG emissions, habitat destruc-
tion as the most important ones. ;

Their management and mitigation includes the poli-
cies of reduce, reuse and recycle, their proper disposal
and innovation in waste management. The new tech-
nologies have been developed for these.

In legislation, the Directive Principles of State Policy
in the Indian Constitution (Article 47) mandate envi-
ronmental protection.

The rapid urbanization and population growth pose
significant waste management challenges. As on date,

only 68% of garbage is collected in India, with just
28% treated.

° ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ launched in 2014 focuses on
waste management, cleanliness, and sanitation.

Types of Waste

1. Biodegradable Waste: Includes food residue and
human excreta, degradable through microbial activity.

2. Non-biodegradable Waste: Includes persistent
materials like petroleum, plastic, and glass.

3. Biomedical Waste: Comprises medical waste like
needles, syringes, and body parts.

4. e-Waste: Consists of electronic items like computers,
batteries, and CFL bulbs.

Sources of Waste: The sources of waste have been
divided into the following categories:

1. Domestic Waste: This includes polythene, bottles,
food scraps, cotton, etc.
2. Industrial Waste: This originates from various indus-

trial activities and can be categorized as follows:

* Food Processing: Contains organic wastes and
pathogens.

e Paper Industry: Includes substances like chlo-
rine, sulfur dioxide, and methyl mercaptan.

e Textile Industry: Arises from the boiling and pro-
cessing of fibers.

¢ Petroleum Industry: Contains inorganic sul-
phur, hydrocarbons, organic acids, etc.

¢ Chemical Industry: Contains substances like
phosphorus, fluorine, and silica.

° Metal Industry: Includes metals such as copper,
lead, chromium, and cadmium.

* Cement Industry: Generates particulate matter
and dust.

e Nuclear Reactors: Produce radioactive wastes,
including plutonium.

3. Agricultural Waste: Includes waste from farming
activities, such as fertilizer, crop residues, pesticides,
and fumigants.

4. Radioactive Waste: Originates from sources like
X-ray machines, nuclear plants, laboratories, etc.

5. Municipal Waste: Generated by public offices, parks,
shops, and other urban areas.

Soup Waste Disposa. MetHops

After the collection of municipal waste from households,
municipal authorities employ three primary disposal
methods:

1. Composting Units:

* Composting is a sustainable process that trans-
forms waste into valuable organic input, enhanc-
ing soil vitality, root growth, and soil moisture
retention.

¢ The objective is to collect organic waste exclusively.

‘2. Biomethanation: Biomethanation involves the pro-
duction of biogas from organic waste.

3. Heat Energy Recovery: Recovering heat energy
in the form of dry fuels from combustible wag;
fractions.

Types of Composting Units

Composting units can be categorized into the followin,
methods: :

1. Aerobic Composting:

e This involves the bacterial conversion of organic.

in solids under the presence of air, hot, and mo

conditions.

¢ This produces compost (humus) that serves g
odourless and pathogen-free fertilizer.

e This reduces waste volume by 50-85%.

e This can be carried out using either manual oy
mechanical means. :

2. Vermicomposting:
° This relies on the joint action of earthworms an
aerobic microorganisms.
e This produces fine, odourless, granular wor
castings, which can be used as biofertilizers in
agriculture.
3. Anaerobic Digestion:
e This occurs when organic waste is buried in pit
under partially anaerobic conditions. ue
e Anaerobic microorganisms break down the waste
releasing methane and carbon dioxide.
e The remaining organic residue becomes valuabl
manure.
e Although slower than aerobic composting, §it
occurs naturally in landfills.
* This can lead to energy recovery through biogas
generation, containing. 55-60% methane, suit-
able for power generation. :
° Less attractive in India due to high moisture and
organic content, along with the low calorific value
of the waste.
° Challenges, such as those faced by the Lucknow
biomethanation plant in 1990, highlight the
importance of designing facilities to handle mixed
waste effectively.

The other strategies have been discussed below:

1. Incineration: This process involves burning waste at
high temperatures, where the 80-90% volume reduc-
tion takes place. The generated heat can be converted
into electricity or this can be directly used for heating
purpose. This can be assumed as a source of renew-
able energy.

¢ Benefit: That lies in reducing landfill space and
can handle certain types of hazardous waste.
The initial cost and maintenance of incineration
plants are high. There can be emission of GHGS _
and other pollutants. We may use advanced filter
ing systems to avoid this.



=== Page 49 ===
7)

Landfill: The waste is buried in designated areas
" known as landfills. Modern landfills are engineered
with liners and other protective measures to minimize
environmental impact.

e Risk: The decomposition of organic waste pro-
duces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Landfills
can also lead to leachate, a contaminated liquid
that can pollute groundwater and soil.

_e Management: This requires careful site selec-
tion, design, operation, and closure to minimize
environmental impact. Gas collection systems can
capture methane for energy use.

Recycling: The process involves collecting, sorting,
and processing waste materials like plastic, paper,
glass, and metals to manufacture new products.

¢ Benefits: This includes reducing the need for raw
materials, saves energy, decreases greenhouse
gas emissions, and conserves landfill space.

The main challenge lies in the fact recycling rates vary
by material and region. It requires public participa-
tion and efficient collection systems. Some materials
lose quality over recycling cycles.

Bioremediation: The process utilizes microorgan-
isms, fungi, or plants to detoxify or remove pollutants
from soil, water, or air.

° Benefits: Bioremediation helps in case of oil
spills, chemical contaminants, heavy metals,
organic pollutants etc. This can be in situ (on site)
and ex-situ (off site). This is cost effective also.
Limitations: The effective depends on the type
of pollutant, concentration, and environmental
conditions. It is generally slower than physical or
chemical methods.

ethanogenesis

thanogenesis is closely linked to the production of
jiogas, commonly known as ‘gobar gas’ in India. This is
biological process in which microorganisms, known as
ethanogens, produce methane (CH,) as a metabolic
yproduct during the decomposition of organic matter in
maerobic (oxygen-free) environments.

Methane produced through methanogenesis can be a
otent greenhouse gas and also serves as a valuable energy
ource when harnessed, such as in biogas production.

YROLYSIS

yrolysis involves the following two steps:

1. Pyrolysis. involves heating organic materials, such as
biomass (wood, crop residues, etc.) or waste materi-
als, to high temperatures. This heating is done in an
oxygen-free (anaerobic) environment to prevent com-
ace and bustion.

ste. » Then ‘decomposition’ of larger organic material hap-
reration pens into smaller ones which are the following:

if GHGs (i) Solid (Char or Biochar): A carbon-rich solid
id filter- residue remains. This can be used as a fuel or as a
soil amendment.

9.49

Gi) Liquid (Bio-oil): A dense, viscous liquid is pro-
duced, which can be refined further to produce
fuels or chemicals.

Gii) Gas (Syngas): The gaseous products include a
mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. This
syngas can be used as a fuel or as a feedstock for
producing chemicals.

Syngas can be further processed to separate and purify
the ‘hydrogen’ that can be used as a clean energy source.

Keeping in view the above discussion, there are two
waste management approaches:

¢ Centralized: Incineration, gasification, pyrolysis
° Decentralized: Biomethanation, vermicomposting

Other Suggestible Points for Solid Waste
Management

e Segregation and community participation are essen-
tial for effective waste management.

° There are two main methods of waste management:
waste reduction and recycling.

* In 2000, the Government implemented the Municipal
Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, man-
dating urban local bodies to manage waste through
collection, segregation, storage, transportation, pro-
cessing, and disposal.

° Major challenges in waste management include:

Gi) Lack of segregation at the source

Gi) Insufficient funding

(iii) Shortage of technical expertise and appropriate
institutional arrangements

(iv) Lack of public participation

° The Kasturirangan Report emphasizes the need for an
integrated waste management approach based on the
5 R’s: Reduce, Reuse, Recover, Recycle. Remanufacture

PLastic Waste

We specifically observe this issue in India but situation
improved somewhat after Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan (Clean
India Mission) was launched in 2014 by Government of
India. The main points are as follow:

i. The entire life cycle of plastics, from manufacturing to
disposal, poses a significant environmental challenge.

2. It contributes to the degradation of land, making it
unsightly and unhygienic. Plastic waste deteriorates
soil fertility and can persist in the soil for extended
periods, disrupting essential soil microbe activity.

3. Plastics have the potential to clog drains, causing
drainage issues. .

4. Plastic waste has been linked to reproductive
problems.

Release of Dioxins

° Plastic manufacturing, particularly of PVC (polyvi-
nyl chloride) can be detrimental to us. Through PVC,
there can be release of dioxins and furans, which are
very toxic and can cause cancer,



=== Page 50 ===
9.50

° As discussed, dioxins are a type of POPs are known for
their ability to remain in the environment for a long
time and accumulate in the food chain. This build-up
poses significant risks to both humans and wildlife.

e The release of these toxic substances into the atmo-
sphere exacerbates environmental pollution. Dioxins
can be transmitted to nursing infants through breast
milk. Thus, they highlight the potential harm to vul-
nerable populations. ,

International Efforts: The international community
recognized the severity of these issues and established the
Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in
2004 as an international environmental treaty to address
such persistent organic pollutants.

Piastic Waste MANAGEMENT RuLes, 2016

¢ The minimum thickness of plastic carry bags was
increased from 40 to 50 microns, and for plastic sheets
as well.

¢ This is expected to raise the cost by about 20%, reduc-
ing the tendency to provide free carry bags and poten-
tially increasing collection by waste-pickers.

¢ Rules focus on ‘Recycling’. This encourages the reuse
of plastic in various applications like road construc-
tion, waste to.oil, and waste to energy processes, aim-
ing to boost plastic recycling.

Ban on Single-Use Plastic, 2022: From July 1, 2022,
India implemented a ban on the manufacture, import,
stocking, distribution, sale, and use of certain single-use
plastic items with low utility and high littering potential.

Thickness Requirement for Carry Bags:

° Until December 31, 2022: Carry bags made of virgin
or recycled plastic must be at least 75 microns thick.

e After December 31, 2022: Thickness requirement
increases to 120 microns

Liouip Waste

Liquid Waste, which encompasses various types of waste-
water and potentially harmful substances, originates from
different sources, including residential, commercial, and
industrial areas.

° Residential: These may be referred to as black water,
primarily contain excreta and grey matter.

© Commercial: For example, restaurants, generate fats
and oils that can be managed using grease traps.

¢ Industrial: The wastewater varies as per industry,
raw materials used, and manufacturing processes.
Some industries producing hazardous compounds.
Thus, hazardous industrial wastewater treatment is
required to remove harmful substances before dis-
charge into the environment.

e Stormwater: They also contribute to liquid waste.

Characteristics of Liquid Waste

Liquid waste exhibits distinct physical, chemical, and bio-
logical characteristics:

e Physical Characteristics: They settle at the bottom -
of a container. They may be in the form of suspended —
solids which are carried in liquid flows. Their tep,.
perature is usually higher than the surroundings. The _
odours may arise due to gas generation during bjg.
degradation.

¢ Chemical Characteristics: Liquid waste containg
both organic and inorganic components.
Organic Matter: We already discussed BOD and Cop
in for this, and COD providing faster results due to
chemical oxidation.
Inorganic Matter: These include ammonia, chloride
phosphates, and metal compounds originating from
various sources, including human and animal waste
salt, fertilizers, and mining operations. ;

° Biological Characteristics: Liquid waste hosts diverse
bacteria and microorganisms originating from various ©
sources, including human waste. While many of these.
microorganisms play a beneficial role in breaking down
organic waste components, some may be pathogenic, _

TREATMENT OF SEWAGE

The sewage can be treated by a modern technique involy- |
ing three steps—primary treatment, secondary treatment
and tertiary treatment

Primary Treatment

1. Goal: Separate solids from sewage.
2. Method: Use filtration and sedimentation to physi
cally remove particles.
3. Result: Sewage with fewer solids but still contains
pathogens and organic matter.

4. Also known as: Mechanical treatment.

Secondary Treatment
1. Process: Neutralized effluents go through a reactor

called sludge.

2. Action: Anaerobic bacteria break down biodegrad-

able material, releasing odour and methane.

3. Conversion: Sewage turns into clean water.

4. Additional step: Water goes to aeration tanks, gets

air and bacteria. This is biological treatment.

Tertiary Treatment

1. Purpose: Disinfect and clean the water further.

2. Steps: Remove remaining bacteria and organic solids.

3. Methods: Use chlorination, evaporation, and
exchange absorption.

4. Outcome: Obtain clean water

Water treatment methods can be categorized into physi-
cal, chemical, and biological methods. Here’s a simplifie
overview with examples:

Coagulation/Mixing: This adds coagulants (like
_jron or aluminium salts) to water, distributing them
evenly through rapid mixing. This prepares particles
for removal.

Flocculation: This forms larger particles from desta-
bilized smaller ones, making them easier to remove
by sedimentation (settling) or flotation.

particles (like oil) to the surface for removal.
Filtration: This uses a filter medium with varying
pore sizes to remove solid particles from a liquid.
Sedimentation: This uses gravity to settle suspended
solids in water.

“HEMICAL MeTHoos

4. Precipitation: Effective for removing heavy metals
from wastewater, often using hydroxide or sulphide
precipitation.

9. Adsorption: Uses a solid (like activated carbon) to
remove soluble substances, especially organic impuri-
ties, from water.

3. Disinfection: Adds chemical disinfectants (like chlo-
rine) to kill remaining microbes after filtration.

IOLOGICAL TREATMENT

1. Aerobic Treatment: Uses oxygen to break down
organic compounds, with mechanical devices provid-
ing continuous oxygen mixing.

2. Anaerobic Treatment: Utilizes bacteria to treat
industrial wastewater, reducing sludge volume and
producing methane gas.

aste Stabilization Ponds. (WSPs): These are also
own as lagoons or sewage lagoons. WSPs make use of
un’s energy, algae, and bacteria to break down organic
atter and remove pathogens from wastewater. They
are a cost-effective and sustainable solution for treating
_wastewater in rural and developing areas.

‘olychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)

¢ Properties: PCBs are heavy, syrupy hydrocarbons,
non-conductive, water-insoluble, and highly stable at
high temperatures.

Uses: Previously used in manufacturing electrical
components.

Ban and Risks: PCBs were banned in 1979 due to
links with. cancer and developmental problems. PCBs
accumulate in fat and become more dangerous up the
food chain.

Presence: Found in warehouses, landfills, rivers, and
hazardous waste sites.

Control Measures: The Environmental Protection
Agency’s Superfund Program was established to man-
age and control PCB contamination.

Biomepica. Waste Manacement (BMW)

® BMW is a waste from medical diagnosis, treatment,
ndrags immunization of humans or animals, research activities,
ints. production/testing of biologicals, and health camps.

Flotation: This uses gas bubbles to carry hydrophobic

9.51

¢ Principles: Emphasizes the 3Rs - reduce, recycle, and
reuse. Aims to avoid waste generation and promote
recovery over disposal.

¢ Hazardous vs Non-Hazardous: Typically, 10-25% of

.  BMWis hazardous; the rest is non-hazardous.

° WHO Guidelines: Introduced ‘The Blue Book’ in
1999, revised in 2014, for safe BMW disposal.

° International Agreements:

(i) Basel Convention: Global treaty on hazardous
wastes.

Gi) Stockholm Convention (2006): Addresses pol-
lutants from medical waste incinerators.

(iii) Minamata Convention (2014): Phases out mer-
cury-containing medical equipment.

e Regulations: Biomedical Waste (Management &
Handling) Rules, 1998, under the Environment
(Protection) Act, 1986, mandate segregation, treat-
ment, and disposal based on colour codes.

Hazarpous Waste

This is any kind of waste that poses a threat to health or
the environment due to its physical, chemical, reactive,
toxic, flammable, explosive, or corrosive characteristics.

Common Contaminants in Hazardous Waste

1. Electronic Waste: Contains harmful elements like
cadmium, lead, and PVC sheathing on cables.

2. Household Chemicals: Includes bleach, oven clean-
ers, turpentine, and paints.

3. Products with Nanoparticles: Often found in sun-
screens, cosmetics, and skin gels, containing zinc and
titanium oxide.

4. Commercial/Industrial Waste: Characterized by a
range of chemicals and heavy metals.

5. Construction/Demolition Waste: Notably contains
asbestos.

6. Biosolids: Particularly sewage sludge, outside of
standard waste streams.

India faces many legal and regulatory challenges in man-
aging hazardous waste. Others are financial constraints,
staff shortages, lack of standardized protocols, and insuf-
ficient legal authority, despite having a comprehensive
legal and regulatory framework in place.

e-Waste (ELectronic Waste)
This can be classified into the following three:

1. White Goods: Household appliances.

2. Brown Goods: TVs, camcorders.

3. Grey Goods: Computers, printers, fax machines,
scanners, etc.

¢ Legislation: e-Waste (Management) Amendment
rules were enacted in. 2018. Earlier, the E-waste (Man-
agement and Handling) Rules, 2011, emphasized
producer and consumer responsibility for disposal.
The E-waste (Management) Rules, 2016, introduced
options for manufacturers, including refundable
deposits and paying for goods return.

Process of the Greenhouse Effect

e Solar Radiation: The Sun emits shortwave radiation,
passing through Earth’s atmosphere and absorbed by
the Earth’s surface.

e Earth’s Emission: Earth then radiates this energy
back as longwave (infrared) radiation.

© Role of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs): Greenhouse gases
inthe atmosphere absorb some of this longwave radiation
and re-emit it in all directions, including back to Earth.

Heat Trapping and Blanket Effect

e Heat Trapping: This re-emission of longwave radia-
tion back to Earth is what traps heat in the atmosphere.

¢ Natural Warming: Without this effect, Earth’s aver-
age temperature would be about -18°C.

e Enhancement by Greenhouse Gases: The green-
house effect raises Earth’s average temperature by
approximately 33°C, leading to a more hospitable
average surface temperature of around 14-15°C.

e Blanket Effect: GHGs act like an atmospheric blan-
ket, absorbing and re-emitting infrared radiation,
which plays a crucial role in maintaining Earth’s
temperature. This heat trap function of GHGs is
termed the ‘blanket effect.’

Human Impact and Global Warming

° Anthropogenic Influence: Human activities since
the 1850s, notably the industrial revolution, have
greatly increased GHGs’ concentrations, enhancing
the greenhouse effect.

° Resulting Temperature Rise: This anthropogenic
enhancement has led to a noticeable increase in
Earth’s average temperature, contributing to global
warming and ongoing climate change.

Global Warming Potential (GWP): GWP is ameasure to
compare the impact of different greenhouse gases relative
to CO,, based on how much energy the emissions of 1 ton
of a gas will absorb over a specific period.

° Importance: It is essential for understanding the rel-
ative impact of various gases on global warming.

imate Change

This refers to significant, long-term changes in aver-
age weather patterns over periods ranging from
decades to millions of years. Climate change can
affect specific regions or the entire planet.
paleoclimatology studies ancient climates using data
from ice cores, tree rings, sediment, coral, shells, and
rocks.

Global Warming (GW)

GW is the gradual increase in Earth’s near-surface air
and ocean temperatures, observed prominently in
recent decades.

Primary Cause: Largely due to human activities like
burning fossil fuels and deforestation, leading to an
increase in heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere.

Impact: Leads to altered weather patterns, forming a
significant aspect of climate change. The terms ‘global
warming’ and ‘climate change’ are closely related but
distinct.

auses of Climate Change

The causes have been divided into two parts — natural and
nthropogenic.

\JATURAL CAUSES

ach of the natural phenomena plays a crucial role in
haping Earth’s climate. Understanding them is vital in
he study of both past and present climatic changes.

1. Continental Drift

* Continental drift is the gradual movement of
Earth’s continents over geological time.

¢ Pangaea Breakup: This has been discussed under
earthquakes in natural hazards.

* Impact on Climate: The movement of continents
affects ocean currents and atmospheric circula-
tion patterns, which in turn influence climate.
For instance, when continents move closer to the
poles, they become covered with ice, reflecting
more sunlight and affecting global temperatures.

Volcanic Activity

* Volcanoes emit sulphur dioxide (SO,), water
vapor, dust, and ash into the atmosphere.

* Cooling Effect: These particles, especially sul-
phur dioxide, can reach the stratosphere where
they combine with water to form aerosols. These
aerosols reflect sunlight back into space, leading
to a cooling effect on the planet’s surface.

¢ Historical Examples: Significant volcanic erup-
tions, like Mount Pinatubo in 1991, have been
followed by measurable decreases in global
temperatures.

9.55

te! The global warming level has reached 418 parts per million (ppm), compared to 280 ppm in the pre-industrial

3. Earth’s Tilt and Orbit

¢ The Earth is tilted at an angle of about 23.5° rela-
tive to its orbit around the sun. This tilt causes the
seasonal variations we experience.

e Orbital Changes: Additionally, Earth’s orbit is
slightly elliptical, causing variations in the distance
between the Earth and the sun over the year.

¢ Climatic Impact: Variations in Earth’s tilt and
orbit over thousands of years (Milankovitch
cycles) can lead to significant long-term climate
changes, such as ice ages and interglacial periods.

4, Ocean Currents

¢ Solar Radiation Absorption: Oceans cover about
71% of Earth’s surface and absorb a large amount
of solar radiation.

¢ Heat Distribution: Ocean currents act as a global
conveyor belt, distributing heat around the planet.
For example, the Gulf Stream carries warm water
from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Atlantic,
influencing the climate of Western Europe.

* Climate Influence: These currents can signifi-
cantly affect climate patterns. Changes in ocean
currents can lead to climate changes such as the
El Nifio and La Nifia phenomena.

Anthropogenic Causes (Human Causes): These have
been discussed separately in the earlier parts also.

° Urbanization and Industrialization: These are
powered by fossil fuels, contributing significantly to
global warming and climate change.

° Electricity Production: Mainly generated from coal-
fired thermal power plants, which are major sources
of greenhouse gas emissions.

Errects of Cuimare CHANGE AND GLOBAL

WARMING

The effects of climate change and global warming are
extensive and varied, impacting nearly every aspect of the
Earth’s environment and human life.

Cyclonic Storms

e Increased Storm Activity: There is notable rise in
both the frequency and intensity of tropical storms in
recent years.

e Formation Mechanism: These storms develop due
to ocean water evaporation and are influenced by the
Coriolis effect, which causes them to spin.

e Cyclones or Hurricanes: When such storms reach
wind speeds over 119 km/h, they are classified ‘as
hurricanes.

e Ice Storms: These occur when precipitation falls as
ice, often due to specific atmospheric conditions.

Loss of Biodiversity

e Habitat Destruction: A significant impact is the loss
of habitats, essential for countless species.



=== Page 56 ===
9,56

1. Forest Ecosystems: Around 70% of land animals
and plants reside in forests, and deforestation
leads to biodiversity loss and species extinction.

2. Forest Value: Forests are crucial for biodiver-
sity, wildlife habitat, and medicinal resources.
Deforestation risks losing unique genetic
resources.

3. Species Extinction Rates: Reports suggest that
up to 50,000 species are lost each year, a concern
raised during the 1992 Earth Summit.

Sea-Level Rise and Ocean Changes

¢ Ocean’s Role in Climate: Oceans absorb CO,, miti-

gating atmospheric CO, levels, but increased CO,
leads to ocean acidification.

¢ Warming Effects: Rising ocean temperatures affect
their ability to absorb CO, and lead to thermal expan-
sion, contributing to sea-level rise.

e Melting of Ice: Melting glaciers and ice sheets further
contribute to rising sea levels.

® Ocean Circulation Changes: Potential large-scale
changes in ocean currents could occur, affecting
global climate patterns.

Coral Reefs Bleaching

¢ Importance of Coral Reefs: Known as ‘rainforests of
the oceans,’ they provide diverse habitats and protect
coastlines.

° Impact of Warming Oceans: Increased sea tem-
peratures and changes in water conditions lead to
decreased photosynthesis in algae, essential for coral
health. This results in coral bleaching, where corals
lose color and vitality.

Additional Marine Impacts

* Polar Ice Melting: Affects marine ecosystems and sea
levels. ,

° Fish Migration: Changes in ocean temperatures lead
to shifts in marine species distribution.

Overall, climate change and global warming have diverse
and profound impacts on the planet, affecting weather
patterns, ecosystems, biodiversity, and marine life.

OtTHer Key DEVELOPMENTS

1. 1896-Arrhenius’ Fossil Fuel Warning: Svante
Arrhenius predicts that burning fossil fuels could
enhance global warming. He notes that only half of
CO, emissions are naturally absorbed, with the rest
accumulating in the atmosphere.

2. 1950-Establishment of WMO: The World
Meteorological Organization is founded in Geneva,
enhancing international cooperation in weather
reporting and related services.

3. 1950s-1960s - Aerosol Pollution and Cooling
Concerns: Smog becomes a major issue in cities,
leading to temperature drops and fears of a new Ice

. Age. The 1954 London Smog is a notable example.

apter 9

4. 1958-The Keeling Curve: Continuous measurement,

of atmospheric CO, at the Mauna Loa Observatory ;

Hawaii begin, resulting in the Keeling Curve, which.

shows rising CO, levels.

5. Revelle’s Ocean Absorption Theory: Roger Randal] -

Dougan Revelle suggests that oceans absorb cg

slower than expected, exacerbating the greenhouse -

effect.

6. 1972-Stockholm Conference: The UN Conference
on Human Environment, focusing on global environ...

mental issues, is held.
7. 1975-Coining of ‘Global Warming’: Wallace 5
Broecker is the first to use the term ‘global warming.
8. 1979-First World Climate Conference: This confer.

ence in Geneva begins a series of global discussions

on climate change.

9. 1983-Brundtland Commission Formation:

The UN’s World Commission on Environment.

and Development, later known as the Brundtland
Commission, is established to explore sustainable
development.
10. 1988-Formation of IPCC: The Intergovernmental

Panel on Climate Change is established to assess

human-induced climate change and suggest solu-
tions. It wins the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 with A]
Gore.
11. 1992-UNFCCC and Rio Summit: The United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change is created
to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations. The Rio
Summit also produces Agenda 21, a plan for sustain
able development.

Tiprinc Point anp Runaway Cuimate CHances

Tipping point logically appears before runaway climate
changes. Tipping point is a threshold point beyond which.

uncontrollable runaway changes will occur. We can play
an analogy between the term ‘tipping point’ and ‘playing
with fire’ that means that if we keep warming the Earth,
we might reach a point where big and unstoppable cli-
mate changes happen. The changes which could not be
controlled are known as runaway changes. Thus, the ini-
tial small anthropogenic aggravate into big uncontrolla-
ble changes. Thus, once tipping points are crossed, they
can lead to runaway climate change.

For Example: The melting of ice at Arctic and Antarctic
may happen after increase of temperature by 1.5 to 2°C
to reach at tipping point. That melting will cause cata-
strophic irreversible changes in the climate of earth.

Triggers of Runaway Climate Change

1. Reduced CO, Absorption: First, we need to see the
natural ability of the climate system. Oceans and ter-
restrial ecosystems (say plants) work as the primary
sinks for the absorption of CO,. That absorption
capacity plays an important role in regulating global
temperature. The absorption rate of primary sinks is
50% of total CO, emissions on earth.

, Declining Absorption and Ocean Acidification:
There is global warming due to increased GHGs. The
temperature of vast seas is also increasing. they absorb
more CO, and becoming acidic. This acidification by
formation of carbonic acids is harmful to marine life
(such as coral reefs) which actually function as lungs.
As oceans warm, they expand. Add to this the melting
of ice by glaciers and ice sheets. Sea level rise threat-
ens coastal communities and ecosystems.

_ Decreased Reflection of Sunlight:

e The retreating snow and ice expose darker ground
around polar areas and water surfaces.

e These darker areas absorb more sunlight, leading
to further warming.

4, Increased Natural Emissions of CO, and Methane:
This are linked with fossil fuels etc. and melting of per-
mafrost as discussed. Overall, sources such as soils,
forests, peatlands, oceans, permafrost, and methane
clathrates emit CO, and methane. The warmer tem-
peratures can increase these natural emissions.

india’s Vulnerabilities: As Per IPCC Reports

e The IPCC is a UN-established scientific body.

Its role is to assess climate change science and impacts.
IPCC reports emphasize rising temperatures, extreme
weather, sea-level rise, and ecological changes.

The term ‘Code Red’ in AR6 (Sixth Assessment Report)
highlights the critical stage of climate change.

* Global CO, emissions must peak by 2020 and then
decline rapidly to reach net zero around mid-century.
¢ To achieve this, global CO, emissions need to be
reduced by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and by
85-90% by 2050.

These reductions are necessary to limit global warm-
ing to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5
degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.

° This signifies immediate action necessary.

In context of India, the following findings are impor-
ant in context of AR6:

1. CVI (Climate Vulnerability Index): This report for
India builds upon the findings of AR6 to assess the
vulnerability of different regions in India to climate
ntarctic change impacts. it provides a localized analysis of
3 to 2°C the risks and helps identify areas that require urgent
se cata- adaptation measures.

th. 2. IPCC on Poverty: This report uses information from
AR6 to understand how climate change could affect
poverty. It warns that climate-related problems might
see the push many people into extreme poverty, harming
and ter their lives and incomes.

primary IPCC on Financial Needs for Adaptation: This uses
AR6 data to calculate the money needed for adap-
tation in various. countries, including India. This

amount of resources necessary for successful adapta-
tion strategies.

4. Temperature Rise and Financial Needs for Net
Zero: This statement recognizes the projections in
AR6 regarding the global temperature rise and under-
scores the financial commitments required by India to
achieve net-zero emissions. It emphasizes the impor-
tance of substantial investments in clean energy and
sustainable technologies as essential steps to combat
climate change effectively.

The Rio Summit, also known as the United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED),
was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from June 3 to 14,
1992. It was the first major international conference on
sustainable development, and it brought together over
170 heads of state and government. The summit resulted
in the adoption of three important documents:

¢ Rio Declaration on Environment and Development:
This declaration contains 27 principles. that outline
the rights and responsibilities of states in the pursuit
of sustainable development.

° Main Principle: ‘The right to development is an
inalienable human right.’

e Agenda 21: This contains over 2,000 recommen-
dations for action by governments, businesses, and
other stakeholders for sustainable development.

¢ The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD):
This international treaty aims to conserve biodiver-
sity; the sustainable use of its components, and the
fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out
of the utilization of genetic resources. This has been
discussed in the coming paragraphs.

UNFCCC Mission: United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted

during Rio Summit in 1992. UNFCCC came into force in ©

1994. There are 197 nations who ratified the convention.

The Mission of UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would
prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
climate system. In this Conference of the Parties (COP)
was adopted as a regular arrangement that is the core
decision making body. To note that all member nations of
UNFCCC are parties to the COP. Thus, UNFCCC created a
legacy, specially in the form of COPs.

REDD+

REDD+ emerged within the UNFCCC, evolving through
international discussions and negotiations. It gained
prominence in the mid-2000s; and was formally recog-
nized as a climate change mechanism. It has been shaped
and refined through global climate conferences and

involves multiple countries and organizations in its imple-
mentation.

More about COP: COP makes global climate policies.
The member states come together to talk about, negoti-
ate, and organize joint efforts to tackle climate change.
Their main goals include cutting down emissions, adjust-
ing to climate change effects, capacity building, funding
and technical help to developing nations.

COP is assisted by two subsidiary bodies which provide
technical expertise and monitor implementation:

1. Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological
Advice (SBSTA) and
2. Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI)

Apart from these two, there are many adhoc working
groups to assist.

* COP decisions are usually made by consensus among
all member countries, although voting is allowed if
consensus cannot be reached.

° The parties outline their commitments to tackle
climate change through Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs).

A Quick idea About Major COPs

Several major COPs under UNFCCC have been held to
advance global environmental efforts. These include:

1. COP3 (Kyoto, 1997): The Kyoto Protocol was
adopted, committing industrialized countries to limit
and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accor-
dance with agreed individual targets. It was the first
agreement to set binding emission reduction targets
for developed countries.

COP11 (Montreal, 2005): The Montreal Action Plan
was agreed upon, marking a significant step forward
in the international climate change process, which
included detailed rules for the implementation of the
Kyoto Protocol.

3. COPIS (Copenhagen, 2009): Although it was
not considered fully successful at the time, the
Copenhagen Accord recognized the need to limit
global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius
above pre-industrial levels.

4. COP16 (Cancun, 2010): The Cancun Agreements
were a set of decisions that included formalizing miti-
gation pledges and taking note of emission reduction
targets of developed countries and actions of develop-
ing countries. ;

5. COP17 (Durban, 2011): The Durban Platform for
Enhanced Action was established, leading to a deci-
sion to develop a new legal instrument that would
apply to all countries by 2015.

6. COP21 (Paris, 2015): The Paris Agreement was a
landmark environmental accord adopted by nearly
every nation to address climate change and its nega-
tive impacts. It aims to limit global warming to well
below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared
to pre-industrial levels.

&

7. COP26 (Glasgow, 2021): This conference saw
nearly 200 countries agree to the Glasgow Climate
Pact, which aimed to accelerate action on climate
this decade. Key outcomes included commitments to.
phase down coal use, reduce deforestation, speed y
the switch to electric vehicles, and increase financial}
support for developing countries

8. COP27 (Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, 2022): This.
focused on implementing the Paris Agreement, which
aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degress
Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared
to pre-industrial levels.

9. COP 28 (United Arab Emirates, 2023): COP28
fcused on the following tasks:

(i) Era of An End of Fossil Fuel: Thus, COP28 shifteq
a clear focus towards renewable energy sources.
There is world’s first ‘global stocktake’ to intensify
climate action before 2030. The aim is to keep the
global temperature rise within 1.5°C. It includes
commitments to cut global greenhouse gas emis.
sions by 43% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels,

(ii) EnhancedNationally Determined Contributions
(NDCs): Parties are encouraged to submit more
ambitious NDCs by 2025, covering all greenhouse
gases and sectors, aligned with the 1.5°C goal.

(iii) Loss and Damage Fund: There was a historic agree.
ment on operationalizing the loss and damage fund, .
with more than USD 700 million pledged, providing
financial support to countries most affected by cli-.
mate change. There was focus on Santiago Network |
for Loss and Damage to provide technical assistance
to countries vulnerable to climate change.

(iv) There was understanding on Global Goal on
Adaptation (GGA) and Climate Finance through
Green Climate Fund at USD 12.8 billion.

10. Future COPs: Azerbaijan is to host COP29 in 2024, .
and Brazil to host COP30 in 2025 for new climat
finance goal and updating NDCs.

Glasgow Meeting Commitments

India made the following commitments to address the
climate change and transition to a more sustainable and
environmentally friendly energy system:

1. To get 500 GW Non-fossil energy capacity by 2030
This includes renewable energy sources such as solar,
wind, hydroelectric, and nuclear power, By expand-
ing its non-fossil energy capacity, India aims to reduce
its reliance on fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse
gas emissions.

2. 50% of its energy requirements from renewable
energy by 2030: So that India aligns with its goal |
to increase the share of clean and sustainable energy
in its energy mix. This transition can contribute to a
significant reduction in carbon emissions and combat
climate change.

3. The reduction of total projected carbon emissions
by one billion tonnes from now to 2030: This reduc-
tion target signifies India’s dedication to curbing its
carbon footprint and mitigating climate change.



=== Page 59 ===
-The reduction of the carbon intensity of the econ-
omy by 45% by 2030, over 2005 levels: This means
that while the economy may continue to grow, it will
‘do so with significantly fewer carbon emissions per
unit of economic output.

To achieve the target of net zero emissions by
2070: This commitment signifies its intent to balance
the emissions it produces with removals or offsetting
measures, ultimately contributing to the global effort
-to limit global warming and its associated impacts.

ARBON IN TRADE

‘ne following discussion may help us.in the better under-
tanding of Kyoto Plan.

arbon Space: This concept refers to the idea of setting
dimit on the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions
jlowable to prevent excessive global temperature rise.
or example, if a limit of 1000 billion tons of CO2 is set
o be not exceeded by 2100, it aims to keep the Earth’s
emperature from increasing more than 2 degrees Celsius
bove pre-industrial levels. We can keep our targets and
ake better mitigation plans.

arbon Trading

arbon trading is a market-based system where compa-
ies buy and. sell emission allowances. Each allowance
ermits a certain amount of carbon dioxide to be emitted.
‘a company emits less CO, than its allowance, it can sell
he surplus to others. This system incentivizes companies
¢ reduce emissions, as they can profit from selling excess
llowances. Carbon trading is relevant for encouraging
nvironmentally friendly practices and meeting global
mission reduction goals.

There are two choices available under carbon trading:

ations (or institutions) which are not in a position to cut
own their pollution or burning more carbon can buy car-
on credits.

_ They buy these credits from countries that are doing
better at reducing pollution, like India or China. Thus, it
makes sense for us to cut down pollution or make invest-
ment in climate friendly projects. Capturing CO, before it
gets to the atmosphere.

Carbon Sink: These are reservoirs or places that hold
onto carbon for a long time. This can be done in following
two ways:

® Natural Carbon Sink: Plants take in CO, and turn it into
food through photosynthesis. The oceans also absorb
_CO,. The example is of afforestation, oceans and soil.
°. Artificial Carbon Sink: These include things like
landfills and special storage methods where carbon is
trapped and stored.

This discussion helps in the understanding of Kyoto
Protocol.

Kvoto PrRoTocoL

As discussed, this protocol was signed during the COP3 in

Kyoto, Japan. This again intends to combat global warm-
ing by reducing GHG emissions. The primary goal is to
reduce GHG emissions in the atmosphere to levels that
would prevent dangerous human interference with the
climate system. The main points are as follows:

1. Legally Binding Targets: It imposed legally binding
obligations on developed countries to reduce their
GHG emissions, aiming for an average reduction of
about 5% below 1990 levels by 2012.

2. India’s Ratification: India ratified the Kyoto Protocol
in 2002.

3. Enforcement: The Protocol came into force in
February 2005. Notably, the USA never ratified it.

4. Common But Differentiated Responsibilities
(CBDR): A key principle of the Protocol, CBDR acknowl-
edges that while all nations are responsible for address-
ing global warming, developed countries have a greater
obligation due to their historical GHG emissions.

5. Country Classifications:
¢« Annex I Nations: Includes developed nations

(such as USA, UK, France, Japan, Russia) with
binding targets for reducing emissions.

¢ Annex II Nations: A subset of Annex I, these
countries are expected to provide financial and
technical support to developing countries and
economies in transition (EITs) for emission reduc-
tion efforts.

* Non-Annex Nations: Developing countries (like
China, India, Indonesia) with no binding emis-
sion reduction commitments, but encouraged to
voluntarily manage their carbon emissions.

6. Mechanisms for Reducing Emissions:
¢ Clean Development Mechanism (CDM): Allows

developed countries to invest in emission reduc-
tion projects in developing countries and earn
carbon credits.

¢ Emission Trading (Cap and Trade): Enables
countries to buy and sell unused emission units.

¢ Joint Implementation (JI): Facilitates emission
reduction projects between Annex I countries.

7. Commitment Periods:
¢ First Period (2008-2012): Initial phase of emis-

sion reduction targets.

* Second Period (2013-2020): Extended phase
with updated targets.

Thus, Kyoto Protocol was a significant step in interna-
tional climate policy that introduced binding targets for
developed nations to mitigate climate change. However, it
could not be effective due to lack of participation of some
major emitters and the complex nature of international
emissions trading.

SEAS

The Paris Agreement, established under UNFCCC. It is a
significant international commitment aimed at combat-
ing climate change. It was adopted in 2015 with the fol-
lowing frameworks and objectives:

1. Frameworks:

* Technology Framework: Encourages develop-
ment and transfer of climate-friendly technologies.

° Capacity-Building Framework: Aims to build
capabilities, particularly in developing countries,
to meet climate challenges.

* Transparency Framework: Ensures clear report-
ing and tracking of countries’ climate actions and
support.

2. Financial Commitments: Developed countries are
required to mobilize at least $100 billion annually by

Figure 9.20 Targets for Paris Agreement

8. India’s Role: India ratified the Agreement and com-
mitted to achieving 40% of its electricity capacity from
non-fossil sources by 2030. India has also played a key
role in the International Solar Alliance (ISA), aiming to
harness solar energy for sustainable development.

Paris Agreement emphasizes collective responsibility,
transparency, and the need for financial and technologi-
cal support to combat climate change effectively.

INTERNATIONAL SOLAR ALLIANCE (ISA)

Formally ISA is not a part of the Paris Agreement but is
aligned with its goals, rather ISA is a voluntary organiza-
tion. India and Paris played pivotal role in raising ISA.

* ISA was launched at the same time as the Paris Cli-

fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) have immense potential.

4. Low carbon Future: Hydrogen fuel is a zero-emission

fuel when burned with oxygen. It can be used in fue]

cells or internal combustion engines. It is also used ag g

fuel for spacecraft propulsion which shows its versatility,

| Production of Hydrogen

There are two basic methods — hydrocarbons and
| renewables.

From Hydrocarbons

1. Steam Methane Reforming: through methane
obtained from natural gas, heating that high
temperatures)

2. Partial Oxidation: oxidizing a hydrocarbon fuel |
(ike natural gas, oil, or coal)

3. Coal Gasification: Coal is converted into a gas},

(syngas), a mixture of hydrogen and carbon

monoxide. L

| From Renewables

1. Electrolysis: split water into hydrogen and oxy-@
gen, and electricity used is derived from renew-
able wind or solar power. The hydrogen pro-||
duced is considered green hydrogen. :

2. Photolysis: Directly splitting water into hydro-

gen and oxygen using sunlight. This method typ-}
ically involves using photoelectrochemical cells. |

5. Challenges to Overcome: As of now, hydrogen pro-
duction consumes more energy than it generates, that |
is called as negative net energy. There is necessity to.
bridge this efficiency gap.

6. There is need for Infrastructure and Policy
Support: This is required for hydrogen production,
storage, and distribution. :

7. Innovation and Collaboration: We need to foster global
partnerships for more research, shared technology,
investments, and collaborative research endeavours.

8. Pilot Projects: Numerous pilot projects across trans-
portation, industry, and energy sectors are underway
to validate and scale hydrogen technologies, which
will be instrumental in the mission’s progression.

Green Ammonia: Green Ammonia is a sustainable chem-
ical primarily used in producing nitrogenous fertilizers,

tributing to a carbon-neutral agricultural sector. Its
ential extends beyond agriculture, as it can serve as a
ate-friendly fuel for shipping and even power engines.
The production of green ammonia involves using hydro-
en obtained from water electrolysis, a process powered by
snewable energy sources like hydro, solar, or wind power.
itrogen, separated from the air, is then combined with
hydrogen in the Haber process to produce ammonia.

ONFERENCE ON Diversity (CBD)

BD represents a global commitment to understanding, pre-
erving, and sustainably using Earth’s precious and diverse
atural resources, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all
e forms and their roles in maintaining ecological balance.
This includes animals, plants, fungi, and microorgan-
ms. The intricate interdependence of these species in
cosystems to maintain ecological balance is important.
CBD was inspired by the world’s growing commitment
sustainable development. It was preceded by the UN
vironment’s Ad Hoc Meeting of Experts on biodiversity in
988 and further shaped during the 1992 Nairobi Conference.

. Prime Goals: These are the following three goals:

¢ Conservation of biological diversity

¢ Sustainable use of its components

¢ Fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from
genetic resources

Accordingly, CBD was opened for signature at the

1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and came into

effect in December 1993.

Biodiversity Scope: It covers all levels of biodiversity,

including ecosystems, species, and genetic resources.

While about 1.75 million species have been identi-

fied, scientists estimate the true number ranges from

3 to 100 million, highlighting the vast genetic diver-

sity within each species.

EY PROTOCOLS

BD conferences occur biennially, with significant meet-
ings including the 2012 conference in Hyderabad, India,
the 2018 UN Biodiversity Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh,
Egypt, and a meeting in Kunming, China, in 2022 which

1. Genetic Resources (GRs): GRs is basically the raw
material for many products and services, including
medicines, food, and cosmetics. The GR is linked with
BioTrade Initiative.

FairWild Standard’, linked with ABS and GR, this is a
certification scheme that ensures that wild-collected
GRs are harvested in a sustainable and ethical manner.

2. Traditional Knowledge. (TK): TK is the knowledge
that indigenous peoples and local communities have
accumulated over generations about the properties
and uses of GRs.

ABS tries to ensure that GRs and TK should share the
benefits of those resources with the countries that pro-
vide them. Those nations should be fairly compensated
for the use of their resources and knowledge.

The protocol also establishes a framework for prior
informed consent (PIC) and mutually agreed terms
(MAT), which are two important safeguards for the rights
of indigenous peoples and local communities.

The Nagoya Protocol has a number of provisions to
ensure compliance.

Aichi Biodiversity Targets Task Force (ABTTF): This
coordinates international efforts to implement the
Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, involving
various agencies and organizations like Zero Extinction,
Birdlife, CITES, FAO, GEF, IUCN, UNEP, and others. They
are the set of 20 global targets for biodiversity conserva-
tion which were adopted by CBD in 2010. For example, at
least 17% of terrestrial and inland water areas, and 10%
of coastal and marine areas. Also By 2020, to improve at
least 15% of degraded ecosystems.

Kunmine-Montreat GLoBaL BioDivERSITY
Framework (GBF)

This set of commitments is made by countries at the UN
Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in December 2022
to address the biodiversity crisis. The key drivers of the
nature crisis:

1. Changes in land and sea use: The GBF calls for a reduc-
tion in the conversion of natural habitats to agriculture
and other human uses. It also calls for the restoration of
degraded habitats. Agriculture alone is a threat to 85 per
cent of the 28,000 species at risk of extinction.
Remember Target: Protecting 30% of the planet’s
land and 30% of its marine areas by 2030.

2. Climate change: Global warming threatens as many
as one in six species at the global level. The GBF recog-
nizes that climate change is a major threat to biodiver-
sity. It calls for action to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions and to help ecosystems adapt to climate change.

3. Pollution: The GBF calls for a reduction in the use of
pesticides and other pollutants that harm biodiver-
sity. The use of pesticides is the ‘MAIN cause’ of plant
and insect decline. There is need for development of
cleaner technologies.



=== Page 64 ===
Remember Target: Reducing pesticide use by 50%
by 2030.

4, Direct exploitation of natural resources: The GBF calls
for more sustainable use of natural resources. Preventing
and reversing the degradation of land and oceans can
prevent the loss of one million endangered species.
Remember Target: Restoring 30% of degraded eco-
systems by 2030.

5. Invasive species: The GBF calls for the prevention
and control of invasive species. It also calls for the
restoration of ecosystems that have been damaged by
invasive species.

IUCN and its Different Categories

International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
was founded in 1948. Its headquarters are in Gland,
Switzerland. It is a global membership union dedicated
to the conservation of nature and the sustainable use of
natural resources. It works with governments, civil soci-
ety organizations, businesses, and indigenous peoples to
develop and implement solutions to the most pressing
environmental challenges.

IUCN Categories include Extinct,. Endangered,
Vulnerable, etc. India’s rich biodiversity is under threat
due to various anthropogenic activities, including habitat
loss, poaching, and pollution. IUCN Red List of Threatened
Species categorizes species facing a high risk of extinction
as Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable. As
of 2023, India’s endangered species list includes 38 birds,
18 amphibians and reptiles, and 81 mammals.

The examples of endangered species include the following:

1. Birds: These include Great Indian Bustard, Indian
Grey Hornbill, Western Ghats Laughingthrush,
White-bellied Heron, Slender-billed Vulture.

2. Amphibians and Reptiles: These include Indian
Narrow-mouthed Frog, Jerdon’s Tree Frog, Malabar
Pit Viper, Indian Crocodile, Hawksbill Turtle.

3. Mammals: These include Indian Wild Ass, Asiatic
Elephant, Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros, Snow
Leopard, Hangul

There is an urgent need of conservation efforts to pro-
tect India’s unique biodiversity. The main conservation
initiatives undertaken focus on habitat protection, anti-
poaching measures, community engagement, and scien-
tific research to ensure the long-term survival of these
threatened species.

Red Data Book: This is developed by IUCN. This is a list
of species that are threatened with extinction. This is used
to raise awareness of the plight of threatened species and
to help countries prioritize conservation efforts. This is
linked with CBD in respect of conservation of biodiversity
in respect of developing national biodiversity strategies,
threatened species, protecting habitats and so on.

As vedic education became highly ritualistic, there was shift
towards Buddhism with focus on ‘Middle Way’ and Anatta
(no-self) and Jainism with focus on extreme non-violence
and asceticism. There were social and economic changes,
with focus on ethics and morality. There was need to address
the issues of broader population. Further, they were sup-
ported by royal patronage from Emperor Ashoka.

We owe a lot to Indians who taught us how to count with-
out which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have
made.

— Albert Einstein

¢ There were ancient systems of education in Egypt,
China, Greece, Mesopotamia and other parts of the
world. China was popular for Confucian system of
teachings. There were many common points and
distinctions. Indian Ancient system made significant
contributions in fields like mathematics (concept of
zero, decimal system), medicine (Ayurveda), astron-
omy, and linguistics (Sanskrit grammar), There was
focus on hoilistic development, ethics and morality.
We may try to have a grasp of certain facts.

© Ancient Indian education, starting around 5000 years
ago with the Vedas, significantly shaped Indian cul-
ture. This system was more than just basic learning; it
promoted deep understanding and spiritual insight.

* Vedic education was essentially secular and included
extensive teachings in science and arts. It was holistic,
integrating the development of the mind, body, and spirit.

* Over time, Buddhism and Jainism emerged in India,
leading to the establishment of globally renowned
universities like Nalanda and Vikramshila. This era
marked India as JagatGurw’ (says — Global Mentor),
drawing students from various regions to its centers of
learning. There is mention of Jagat Guru in National
Education Policy - 2020 as well.

° In ancient India, diverse ideas and learning methods
coexisted, with people contemplating them in differ-
ent ways. This education system was equitable, treat-
ing all knowledge areas with equal importance.

© Inthis unit, we will take a full view of education, start-
ing from ancient education to modern education.

EVOLUTION OF ANCIENT EDUCATION

The term ‘Veda’ (4) originates from ‘Vid’ meaning
‘knowledge.’ Vedas symbolize boundless knowledge and
are regarded as limitless. Ancient Indian education was
shaped by religious, political, and economic influences.
In ancient Indian philosophy, ‘dharma’ (+4) had a wide-
ranging meaning, encompassing ideals, practices, and
behaviours that define the righteous path. In Unit 6, we
touched upon many facts.

Vedic Period (1500-500 BcE)

° Vedas and Upanishads (a@ sit safiaa): During
this period, the Vedas, ancient India’s oldest religious
and philosophical texts, were composed. The Upani-
shads, explaining the Vedas’ philosophical ideas, also
emerged.

e Epic Period (Heentet aie): This era witnesseg
the creation of epic texts like the Ramayana and
Mahabharata, which includes the Bhagavad Gita. Te
was also marked by the rise of Jainism and Buddhism
and the codification of Manu Smriti.

° Sutra Period (Ga @i1e): This period saw the develop.
ment of significant texts like Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras:
Gautama’s Nyaya, and the Mimamsa Shastras. 7

° Rise of Mahayana Buddhism (Herat aheg ent aq
sea): Nagarjuna (AMM) played a pivotal role in this
era, marking the rise of Mahayana Buddhism.

° Scholastic Period ( wre): This period’s key
contributions include Shankaracharya’s (afaraRs)
work and the development of the Vedanta Philosophy,

* Post-900 CE: The rise of Vedantic schools such as
Visishtadvaita and Dvaita (fafssiga sik $4) charac.
terized this period.

Two Dimensions of Knowledge: There are following two
aspects of knowledge:

Para Vidya (aa faeir): Para Vidya in education is
about attaining higher knowledge and spiritual wisdom.
Its supreme goal is to help individuals realize their union
with the Absolute God and recognize the divine essence
within themselves.

Apara Vidya (stat faa): Apara Vidya, on the other
hand, focuses on lower or secular knowledge. It encom-
passes the practical and worldly aspects of life, often,
referred to as materialistic elements that contribute to a

comfortable existence. This includes various secular sci- ben
ences and disciplines. ,

EpucaTioN THOUGH Mopes oF TRANSMISSION

In Indian scriptures, texts are broadly classified into two
tegories: Shruti and Smriti. This classification is based
on the method of their transmission and the nature of
their composition.

1. Shruti( aqfet): This can be simplified as revealed texts,

that is what is being divinely heard.

° The Four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva)
and the 108 Upanishads fall under the Shruti
category.

° Shruti texts are regarded as the core scriptures of
vedantic system, they hold the highest authority.
They are believed to be the timeless and eternal
knowledge revealed to ancient sages (Rishis).

. Smriti (zafa): This may be termed as remembered
texts. These texts are considered to be authored by
sages based on their understanding and interpreta-
tion of Shruti.

® This category includes a wide range of texts such
as the Bhagavad Gita, the 18 Puranas, Kautilya’s
Arthashastra, Vatsyayana’s Kama Sutra, various
Tantras, and many more.

° They provide more practical and detailed elabo-
rations on the philosophical principles found in
Shruti. They include laws, rituals, ethical codes,
and narratives that guide the social and religious
practices of Vedic system.

EpucaTION Process

In ancient India, the education process was well-struc-
tured and consisted of several important stages

1. Vidyarambha (faamest): The education began at the
age of 5. This stage marked the initiation of formal
learning.

2. Upanayana (Seat):

This was the formal education ceremony, also
known as the sacred thread ceremony.

e In the Guru’s home, the learner experienced a
second birth, becoming a ‘Dvija’ (iss), which
means ‘twice-born’.

e The first birth is from the biological parents, and
the second is from the spiritual master and Vedic
knowledge.

° This stage typically started between the ages of 8
and 12. During this phase, the student was called

a ‘Brahmacharin’ (seait4), denoting a period of
celibacy and study.

° After completing their education, a Brahmacharin
could become a ‘Grihasta’ (TERI), or householder.

e ‘Brahm Sangh’ (#é Wt) was an opportunity for
students to acquire higher knowledge. The timing
of this ceremony varied among castes.

3. Study in Gurukul (eqet): The students typically
studied in the Gurukul for about 12 years.

e After this period, they were allowed to return
home, and the Guru provided them with final
instructions.

e The completion of this phase was marked by the
‘Samavartan Sanskar’ ( GER), a ritual
signifying the end of formal education.

4. Fees and Gurudakshina (a{eafarom):
° There was hardly any interference by ruling class
in the payment of fees.
e The concept of ‘dignity of labour’ was encouraged,
with students often working hard in various tasks.
e At the end of their education, students offered
‘surudakshina’, a token of gratitude or acknowl-
edgment to their teacher.
As per another perspective, the educational process
involved three basic stages:

1. Sravana (3Ta&01): This refers to acquiring knowledge
by listening, especially to the ‘shrutis’.

2. Manana (14): The students reflected on and ana-
lyzed what they had learned, assimilating the lessons
and drawing their own inferences.

3. Nididhyasana (fafgeare ): This stage involved com-
prehending the truth and applying it in real life, a
kind of reflective stage.

Susvects in Vepic EpucaTion

2. Anviksiki (siFafaret): Science of inquiry/logic,
including atma (S11 - soul) and hetu (ed - theory of
reasons). .

Vedic education took a comprehensive approach, often
requiring long years of study to master a single Veda, and
graduates were called ‘Snatka’ (@d#). The graduation
ceremony was known as ‘Samavartana’ (Wadd). This
system covered a wide range of subjects, blending practi-
cal skills with philosophical and spiritual teachings.

Vepic Eoucation

We are taking a brief picture of oldest vedic texts as a
guide of humanity in the following manner.
¢ Sambhitas (tifeat): Mantras and benedictions
e Aranyakas (3IRVas ): Texts on rituals, ceremo-
nies, and symbolic sacrifices
¢ Brahmanas (ate): Commentaries on rituals
and ceremonies
° Upanishads (3afa@): Discussions on medita-
tion, philosophy, and spiritual knowledge
e Language: The Vedas are composed in Vedic
Sanskrit

Components of the Vedic System

° Six Vedangas (gaat): Auxiliary disciplines of the

Vedas. These are important to us:

@ Shiksha (ret): Phonetics and phonology, focus-
ing on the correct pronunciation of Vedic texts.

Gi) Kalpa (eq): Ritual and ceremonial procedures,
detailing how Vedic rituals should be performed.

(iii) Vyakarana (caTHrtot): Grammar and linguistic
analysis, ensuring the precise usage of Sanskrit in
Vedic texts.

(iv) Nirukta (fe): Etymology and explanation of
words, particularly those found in the Vedas.

(v) Chandas (38): Meter in Vedic poetry, studying
the poetic structure in the Vedas.

(vi) Jyotisha ): Astronomy and _ astrology,
used mainly for timing rituals and understanding
the calendar.

° Six Darshanas (Way): The six systems of Hindu
philosophy. These have been discussed in Unit 6 -
Samkhya (4f@1), Yoga (4m), Nyaya (=H), Vaishe-
shika (A893), Mimamsa (44a), Vedanta (Agia)

° Purana (QUT); Ancient Indian narratives. There are
18 major Puranas, known as ‘Mahapuranas’ such as

Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu Purana, Shiva Pur.

ana, ane

Padma Purana.
° Tarkshastra (@M9ET): The science of logic and
reasoning.

° Upanishad (saftaq): Spiritual and philosophical dig
Cussions. The word ‘Upanishad’ is derived from 4).
(near), ‘ni’ (down), and ‘shad’ (to sit), which trans.
lates to ‘sitting down near, referring to the studen;
sitting near the teacher to learn the secret teachings.
° Acknowledgment of Vedas: Upanishads, Smritis
and Puranas all recognize the supremacy of the Vedas.

Number of Vedas: There are four Vedas.
(i) Rigveda (3e): One of the oldest texts, con.
taining hymns and praises to various deities and
natural forces. It’s crucial for understanding the
religious and cultural practices of ancient India.
(ii) Yajurveda (ayaa): This Veda combines prose
and poetry, mainly associated with ritual per
formances, particularly Yagya rituals. It provides _
instructions for these ceremonies.
(iii) Samaveda (aTAae): Known for its emphasis on
musical elements, the Samaveda consists of mel.
odies and chants used in religious rituals and is
linked to the hymns of the Rigveda.
(iv)Atharva Veda (314444): Diverse in content, ©
focusing more on everyday life aspects, including _
medicine, science, and philosophy. it’s known for.
its collection of spells and incantations.

e The Rig Veda, also called as Rig Veda Samhitaa (col-
lection of vedas - #4 HfeM), marks the beginning of
formal education. This period saw the institutional-
ization of rituals, leading to two key developments:
G@) The emergence of gods with distinct powers.

(ii) The rise of a specialized priestly class (that might
have cause estrange among common people).

Stages of Vedic Education

* Early Learning: Initially, education focused
on memorizing sacred texts like the Vedas and
dharamshastras (T4311).

* Advanced Learning: Later, the curriculum
expanded to include grammar, logic, metaphys-
ics, and other allied subjects, emphasizing criti-
cal thinking (faa4 -‘chintan’) and intellectual
development.

Components and Focus of Vedic Education:

(i) Encompassed teachings from _ sutras
Brahmanism.

(ii) The primary focus was on the mind, with oral
teaching and mental exploration being key
methods. ,

(iii) The Brahman Sangh played a crucial role, provid-
ing meritorious students the opportunity to deive
deeper into intellectual pursuits. ,

(iv) Figures like Lord Buddha employed storytell-
ing to effectively convey complex teachings and
principles.

» From Rituals to Knowledge: Ancient Indian edu-
cation evolved from the Brahmanas ( iS - ritual-
focused) to the Upanishads (aM #1 - knowledge-
focused), transitioning from ritual practices to
seeking deeper understanding.

« Aranyaka Phase: The Aranyaka (SR°4) period was
a bridge from the practical Brahmanas to the philo-
sophical Upanishads. It marked a shift from societal
roles to contemplative life, often in forests, for the
elderly.

¢ Forest Retirement: Elderly retiring to forests symbol-
ized a journey back to roots and a quest for wisdom,
representing a spiritual and philosophical exploration
beyond mere physical relocation.

1. Upanayana Ceremony (Saat WEAN): This vital
Vedic ritual marking the commencement of formal
education for women.

2. Types of Educated Women:
* Sadyodwahas ): These women pursued

studies until marriage, after which their formal
education typically concluded.

° Brahmavadinis (a@atfeit): In contrast to
Sadyodwahas, Brahmavadinis chose not to marry,
dedicating their lives to ongoing education and
scholarly endeavors.

Women studied the Vedas and Vedangas, showing their

engagement in religious and philosophical education.

They often recited hymns necessary for Yajnas (4a) and

other ritualistic activities during rituals (178M). We can
take prominent examples of _rishikas (aivent) such as
Maitreyi (eri) and Gargi (iri), who were esteemed for
their wisdom and scholarly contributions.

Shift from Vedic System towards Buddhism and
Jainism: The Vedas, somehow indirectly influenced the
emergence of Buddhism and Jainism in the following
manner:

There was a reaction to vedic ritualism.
2. The focus shifted towards ethics and morality, though
there were changes in vedic philosophy also. There
were social and economic changes.

3. There were philosophical differences, they developed

their unique doctrines and practices.

4. Buddhism and Jainism appealed to broader popula-
tion, there was royal patronage such as by emperors
such as Ashoka.

5. Buddhism and Jainism tried to connect with people
in common languages. Early Buddhist scriptures,
known as the ‘Three Baskets’ (Tripitaka - faften) or
Pali Canon, were written in Pali (afc). That was the
common language in Bihar and UP where Buddhism
originated. Similarly, the early Jain scriptures, includ-
ing the Agamas (21774), were written in Ardhamagadhi
Prakrit (aeinmeit weed). Jainism later used Sanskrit for
accessing Indian philosophy.

There are 24 Tirthankaras (atime) in Jainism, the spir-
itual leaders who attained enlightenment, are highly
revered. Rishabhanatha GessM1%), the first Tirthankara,
and Mahavira (Heat), the 24th and final Tirthankara, are
particularily esteemed.

Jain teachings focus on ethical living Cif sila),
spiritual growth (sTeafere faenra), and the welfare of all
beings. This philosophy underlines principles like non-
violence (stfa), truthfulness (44m), and non-attach-
ment (€tFa), guiding followers towards a path of moral
and spiritual purity.

Basadis (Saal) are Jain tempies or monasteries where
devotees and monks perform worship and rituais.
‘Saptabhangi (aefivenyei)’ or “Sapta Puri(aa Ti)’ are the
highiy sacred places for Jains such as Ayodhya, Uijain,
Mathura, Dwarka, Kashi, Kanchipuram.

Jainism mentioned the following:

© Dharma (214) is the Jain concept of righteousness
and the path to liberation.

° Nirjara (FSRD is the process of purification of the
soul.

° Bandha (a) is the attachment of the soul to karma.

° Moksa (ata) is liberation from the cycle of birth and
death.

© Adharma (3teR4) is the opposite of dharma and leads
to bondage.

° Akasha (also spelled as akasa - ST&T9) is the first
of the nine primary substances (tattva 7) and is con-
sidered to be the fundamental constituent of space.

Texts such as Samavaya Sutra (AA at Aas Ya) and
Pragnapara Sutra (4a YA) mention various scripts,
with the former discussing 64 types and the latter about
a dozen. Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsang (aun win - during
King Harshvardhana in 7th century) noted that children’s
education started with learning alphabets, followed by
subjects like grammar, arts and crafts, medicine, logic,
and philosophy. The following concepts are important.



=== Page 71 ===

1. Anekantavada (3Mentaate): Termed as ‘non-abso-
lutism’, this principle holds that objects have infinite
modes of existence, and only Kevalins (enlightened
beings) can fully comprehend all knowledge aspects.
Syadavada (@leate ): A theory of conditioned predi-
cation, suggesting that our perceptions and judgments
are conditional and depend on specific situations.

3. Nayavada (~aale): This emphasizes partial view-
points, describing reality from various perspectives.
Sevenfold Predication, known as Saptabhangi (aa)
in Jainism, is a concept associated with Nayavada. It
outlines a unique approach to expressing statements,
emphasizing their conditional and relative nature.
Saptabhangi illustrates that any statement can be
seen from seven different perspectives, each reflect-
ing a different aspect of truth.

In Jainism, the approach to learning and imparting
knowledge encompasses various methods, each serving
a specific purpose in the educational process. Here’s how
each term fits into this system:

1. Vachana (ater): Reading scriptures or texts is
essential in Jain education, focusing on the Agamas
and other religious writings.

2. Prachchana (West): This method values asking
questions and dialogue, encouraging students to clar-
ify doubts and deepen their understanding.

3. Anupreksa (3T{WaIT): It involves reflecting on what
has been learned, with critical thinking and self-
reflection being key in Jain philosophy.

4. Amhaya (3141): This systematic approach breaks

complex subjects into smaller parts for thorough and

in-depth understanding.

Dharmapalesa (eatery): It entails spreading reli-

gious teachings widely, with Jain monks and scholars

preaching principles like non-violence and ethical liv-

ing.

Main Scripture: ‘Agamas’ (31rT4) refers to the sacred texts
of Jainism, which contain the teachings and philosophies

TRANSMISSION [ViopEs In Ancient Epucation

These methods remained integral to the educational
processes in ancient education. They reflect a holistic
approach which combined rote learning with critical
thinking, practical application, and interactive learning.

1. Oral Transmission of Knowledge: This method was
crucial due to the limited availability of written texts.
In Hinduism, the Vedas and other scriptures were tra-
ditionally passed down orally. Jainism also relied heav-
ily on oral transmission of its scriptures and teachings.

2. Memorization: Memorizing texts and teachings
was a foundational method, essential for preserving
-knowledge across generations.

bog

Critical Analysis and Introspection: The learn?

ers acknowledge the importance of teachings (map.

tras) in their lives. They try to deeply internalize thi,
knowledge, by applying them in their daily actions
and decisions.

. Storytelling: Lord Buddha used this method specifi.
cally used to explain His doctrines. That made com.
plex ideas more accessible and relatable. This ke
method was also used in Hinduism and Jainism fo;
conveying moral and ethical lessons. ~

5. Question and Answer Method: This interactive
approach encouraged students to delve deeper into
subjects, clarifying doubts and expanding their
understanding.

6. Hands-on Method: For practical subjects like medi-
cal science, hands-on learning was employed to give
students real-world experience and skills.

7. Seminars, Debates, and Discussions: Seminars

were used for debates and discussions, promoting

critical thinking and the exchange of ideas, they facil-
itated intellectual development and mastery of the
subjects.

Education and Translation Efforts: A significant project
involved translating Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit
into Tibetan, forming the Tibetan Buddhist philosophy
(Kangyur and Tengyur). This project included many nota-

ble Indian and Tibetan scholars.

Indian Scholars: Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche)
Ceniva CTS )): He worked hard to translate
texts, helping to establish Buddhism in Tibet. Similar
efforts were made by Atisha (3ifagi — 982 — 1054 CE) and
Shantarakshita (sazféta), both Indian scholars.

Tibetan Translators

° Thonmi Sambhota (arrit diet): He is credited —
with creating the Tibetan script from Indic scripts, he
enabled the translation of Sanskrit texts into Tibetan.

* Vairotsana (Qtr): made similar efforts by working
diligently to translate numerous texts into Tibetan.

° Marpa Lotsawa (Ataf eieatar) is known as ‘Marpa
the Translator’. After studying under Indian masters,
he returned to Tibet with many texts.

1. Non-Vedic Philosophy Schools: Buddhism, along
with Jainism and Charvakas, is part of the Nastika
schools (aI), which reject the authority of the
Upanishads.

2. Emphasis on Renunciation: Buddhism focused on
subjects that led away from worldly life enrichment,
prioritizing the renunciatory aspect of education.

3. Jiva (sia), also known as Jivatman, refers to the
living, sentient soul or essence of a being and Ajiva

_ Mass Education by Lord Buddha: Started 2600 years
ago, Buddhist education was inclusive, beyond caste
divisions. The Dhamma Vinaya (44 fava) included
ethical codes and’ moral advice. Lord Buddha’s
. first sermon in Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh, is known as
Dharma-Chakra-Pravartana (u4-aa-wad").
. Middle Path and Individual Responsibility: Buddha
advocated the ‘Middle Path’ (474 arth, emphasizing
personal happiness and responsibility. Begging by dis-
ciples aimed to eliminate ego.
Democratic Expansion and Monasteries:
Buddhism’s democratic principles led to rapid expan-
sion, with many monasteries evolving into universi-
ties. Bhikkhus (fg) and Bhikkhunis or Upasikas
(fargo a saftent) were the main students.
, Sangha for Management: Monks were organized
into Sanghas (Ht) for better management. The com-
munity of monks, nuns, novices, and lay followers is
called as Sangha (#1).
, Contribution to Art and Architecture: Notable con-
tributions include stupas (&{4) at Sanchi, Bharhut,
and Gaya.
. Life-Long Monastic Commitment: Unlike the Vedic
system, Buddhist students often remained monks,
severing worldly ties permanently. ~
. Oral Tradition and Written Teachings: Buddha’s
teachings, originally oral, were written in Pali around
25 BCE. .
Key Texts: Important texts include Divyavadana
), Dipavamsa (etv4e), Mahavamsa (Hetae),

causes of suffering.

3. Nirodha (fta- ): The cessation of suffer-
'_ ing, asserting that it’s possible to liberate oneself from
suffering.

4. Magga (art-e wate): The path leading
to the cessation of suffering, outlining the Eightfold
Path as a means to achieve this liberation.

Popular Meditation Practices: Vipassana and Samatha

1. Vipassana (faaget) - Insight meditation through
three elements:

(i) Impermanence (feet - Anicca): Recognizing
that everything in existence is transient and con-
stantly changing.

(ii) Suffering ({@a - Dukkha): Understanding that
suffering is an inherent part of existence.

(iii) Non-self (3T aT - Anatta): Realizing the absence
of a permanent, unchanging self or soul in beings
and phenomena.

2. Samatha (3Ta%) — Tranquility (calmness) by focus-
ing on a single object, like the breath, a mantra, or a
visual object.

Eightfold Path: Right view, Right intention, Right
speech, Right action, Right livelihood, Right mindfulness,
Right effort, Right concentration.

Five Precepts (Gagite-Panchsheel): Lord Buddha
suggested abstain from the following: Violence (fé€t),
Stealing (Nt), Sexual Misconduct (HH* ar), Lying

Buddhist Councils (at Wet): In total, four major
Buddhist councils were conducted.

1. The First Council (ager ete ): This was held in 483
BCE in the Sattapani cave at Rajgriha. The teachings
of Buddha were divided into three Pitakas (fT2m):

(a) Vinaya Pitaka (fata fae@): Rules of conduct
and discipline applicable to the monastic life of
the monks and nuns.

(b) Sutta Pitaka (Qa fea ): The main teaching or
Dhamma of Buddha (it is divided into five Nikayas
or collections).

(c) Abhidamma Pitaka ( 3if4er4 faes ): A philosoph-
ical analysis and systematization of the teaching
and the scholarly activity of the monks.

2. The Second Council (fed Ga): This was conducted
in Vaishali.

3. The Third Council (qta Wea ): This was conducted in
Pataliputra under the patronage of Ashoka.

4, The Fourth Council (aqet zat): This was conducted
at Kundalvana, Kashmir. :

Two Sects of Buddhism

1. Mahayana (Agar -- Great Vehicle): it believes in
the higher order and idol worship of Buddha. It soon
spread in northern India and then to China, Korea,
Tibet, and Japan. Zen is also a school of Mahayana.



=== Page 73 ===
2. Hinayana (ara — Lesser Vehicle): Also known as
Abandoned Vehicle or Defective Vehicle. It believes in
the original teaching of Buddha or doctrine of elders.
Theravada is a Hinayana sect.

In fact, Buddhism is a way of ‘soft diplomacy that was
more liberal than ‘vedic’ approach. It promoted the spread
of Indian culture to other parts of Asia.

Effective revitalization of the Nalanda University proj-
ect and encouragement of Buddhist studies in well-estab-
lished universities will bring the international community
to acommon platform.

Tvees OF TEACHERS

1. Acharya (31Tad): Revered teachers of the Vedas

fees.

2. Upadhyaya (sareara): Teachers who focused on a
part of the Veda (@@) or Vedangas (dei), earning a
livelihood through teaching.

3. Charakas (=X ): Wandering scholars traveling for
higher knowledge and facilitating the exchange of
ideas.

philosophy, theology, law to name a few.

Example: Sangam in Tamil Nadu, they work for criti-
cism also and would receive royal patronage.

3. Goshthi (71 ): These were national conferences con-
vened by kings for representatives of various schools
to debate and discuss ideas.

4, Ashramas (311814): These were hermitages around
sages like Bharadwaj at Prayag, offering diverse learn-
ing including fire worship (Agnisthana - Hf4ee),
Vedas (Brahmasthana - Seka), Raja Niti, and
Arthaniti (Vishnusthana - fesupee).

5, Vidyapeetha ( ): These are institutions for
spiritual education founded by Acharyas like Sri
Shankara in places like Sringeri and Puri.

taken, which formed the basis of the Tibetan Buddhist
canon Kangyur’ (@PqX) and ‘Tengyur’ (dx). The former
refers to translated words of Lord Buddha and later to the _
various scholars and practitioners.

Taxita University (aartoren fastener )

The university offered a wide variety of subjects that was
aimost 68 in number. The distinguished scholars were
the following:

Be

G) Panini (arfinfy): The ancient Sanskrit grammarian
known for his work ‘Ashtadhyay?’ (3184), the foun-

dational text on Sanskrit grammar.

(ii) Charak (@R& ): The legendary figure in Indian medi-
cine, author of the ‘Charaka Samhita’, a foundational
text in Ayurveda.

(iii)Other scholars traditionally associated with Taxila
include Kautilya {also famous as Chanakya or
Vishnugupta) and Vishnu Sharma, though histori-
cal evidence of their direct connection to Taxila is
not definitive. Vishnu Sharma wrote ‘Panchatantra’
(Wada) ;

Thus, due to above associations, Taxila university was

famous for medicines, political sciences, languages

(Sanskrit), Vedic and Buddhism studies, military to name

a few.

e The University attracted students from Babylon,
Greece, Syria, and China. There was influence of
Greek culture after the invasion of Alexander that was
fusion of Gandhar and Greek culture.

Buddhist principles of ethical conduct and wisdom.
That was a kind of story telling and oral tradition.

ALANDA University (*eter fasfererrera )

alanda University, akin to modern institutions like
xford and Harvard for its universal approach and exten-
ve curriculum, was a prestigious centre of learning in
cient India.

The university is situated near Rajgriha (Ute) in
Bihar, Nalanda was a pivotal center for Mahayana
Buddhism (Hear ate 4) and the birthplace of Sar-
iputta Caitga), a prominent disciple of Lord Buddha.
Ic functioned from approximately 427 to 1197 cE.
The campus of university extended over approxi-
mately 1.6 kms by 0.8 kms that comprised eight large
halis (Gah) and 300 studyrooms. —
Administration and Faculty: Sheelbhadra (3it4a),
serving as the kulpati (@eafa) or chancellor, over-
saw a faculty that included teachers like Dwar Pandit
(gR-Ufed). Chinese traveller Hiuen ‘Tsang noted the
presence of 10,000 monks and 200 professors in
residence.

Stringent Admission Tests: Nalanda had a tough
entrance examination with a success rate of about
30%. It specialized in various subjects, particularly in
the faculty of Logic (A#3NEA).

Teaching Methodologies: The university employed
diverse methods, including verbal explanation, lec-
tures, and debates/discussions for teaching.

Library and Astronomical Studies: It boasted a
vast library, Dharma Gunj (4]S) or Mountain of
Knowledge, with three main sections: ‘Ratna Sagar’
(%@ APR), ‘Ratnodavi’ (<aleat), and ‘Ratnayanjak’
(aaah). The university also housed an observa-
tory, Ambudharaaviehi (37aertacifé), for astronomi-
cal research.

Cultural Impact and Legacy: Nalanda significantly
contributed to the cultural and intellectual advance-
ment of India, during Gupta era.

° Destruction and Revival: The university was ulti-
mately destroyed towards the end of the 12th century
CE, primarily due to the invasions led by Bakhtiyar
Khilji. In 2010, a new Nalanda University was estab-
lished in Bihar with international support, reviving
its legacy. The help was provided by Japan, China,
Thailand, Laos, Singapore and Australia in various
manners.

e Aryabhatta, Dharampala, Sheelbhadra (Yogacara
school linked with Heenyana Buddhism), (Hstian-
Tsang, Nagarujna) have been prominent scholars of
Nalanda University.

e Aryabhata belonged to Pataliputra (areieq)
during the 5th century AD, in the Gupta Era. He
was a mathematician and astronomer.

This university was a significant center of learning,
was prominent in advancing Hinayana Buddhism and
various secular studies from 600 cz to 1400 cE.

Thus, this university again played a role in Buddhist
and secular education. Arthashastra (31 -econom-
ics), Niti Shastra (Alfaset - law), and Chikitsa Shastra
¢ - medicine) were the prominent courses
here. It was highly regarded by Chinese travelers Hiuen
Tsang and Itsing for its comprehensive curriculum.

jaGADDALA University (Street fasferenera )

Jagaddala University was established by Raja Ram Pal
of the Pala dynasty, patrons of Buddhism and educa-
tion. This was famous translating Buddhist texts into
Tibetan.

This university also served as a center for Buddhist
education, especially Mahayana Buddhism, under-
lining the Palas’ commitment to Buddhism. The uni-
versity operated for about 100 years for Buddhist
scholarship.

Jagaddala was destroyed during an invasion in 1203
CE.

Mituica University (fafarert fasfererrera )

Mithila, also known as Videha (faeé), emerged as a
prominent center for Brahmanical education during
the Upanishadic era. This maintained its influence
from Raja Janak through the Buddhist period to devo-
tees of Lord Krishna.

Mithila was the birthplace of famous poets like
Vidyapati, who wrote in Hindi, and Jaideo, a noted
Sanskrit poet.
There were diverse courses such as literature, fine
arts, and scientific subjects. The university was
known for its teachings in Nyaya Shastra (4 86a)
and Tarka Shastra, with Gangesha Upadhyaya estab-
lishing a school of New Logic (7 =).

This great institution was established in Kashmir in the
2nd century BCE, that era is termed as the golden age
of Sanskrit learning in Kashmir. Fhe renowned scholars
such as Abhinavagupta (SfMaqe) and Kalhana (eT)
contributed significantly. The philosophy, poetry, and his-
tory were main fields.

SHARDAPEETH (STITaTUTS)

Established in the 6th century CE, Sharada Peeth thrived
for centuries as a renowned temple-university dedicated
to the goddess Saraswati, the Hindu deity of knowledge
and learning.

Sartore: (GATT)

With numerous hostels, it catered to a diverse student
body, emphasizing the importance of inclusive education
in ancient India.

Ennavirnam (warferea )

This provided free boarding and tuition, it exemplified the
ancient Indian emphasis on making education accessible.

Note: The universities at Takshashila, Nalanda, Valabhi,
Vikramshila, Odantapuri and Jagaddala developed in
connection with the viharas (mainly Buddhism). The uni-
versities at Benaras, Navadeep and Kanchi developed in
connection with temples and became centres of commu-
nity life in the places where they were situated.

OtHeR SCHOLARS IN ANCIENT INDIA

1. Sushruta (Gf): Known as the ‘Father of Surgery,’
he authored the ‘Sushruta Samhita’ (G4q Wed), a
seminal text if ancient Indian medicine, particularly
surgery. The specific university or educational cen-
ter where he was possibly linked to universities like
Takshashila.

2. Vagbhata (ate): He was composer of ‘Ashtanga
Hridayam Samhita’ (si ean fed), another
important work in Ayurveda.

3. Varahamihira (azretafat): Born in Ujjain, he was an
astronomer and mathematician. His work, ‘Pancha-
siddhantika’ (ta-fergifaal), suggests that he was part
of the scholarly tradition of Ujjain, which was known
for its astronomical and mathematical studies.

4, Bhaskaracharya ( ): A12th-century math-
ematician known for his work in the decimal number
system and an early understanding of gravitational
theory. He might have been associated with Ujjain.
Siddhanta Siromani (fasta Rr) by him was a
major treatise on mathematics and astronomy.

The authorship of the Surya Siddhanta (wa it) is
attributed to Latadeva ( ), an Indian astronomer
who lived in the 6th century.

Pingala (figer): His work on binary numbers and
combinatorics suggests he was part of an advanced
mathematical tradition.

6. Brahmagupta (aera): His astronomi-
cal and mathematical writings, particularly in
‘Brahmasphutasiddhanta’ ( Id), indicate he
was part of the academic tradition of Ujjain.

7. Bhaskara-I (Weptl): A 7th-century mathemati-
cian who wrote about the Hindu decimal system and

Languages Used

1. Sanskrit during Vedic education
2. Prakrit during Jain education
3. Pali during Buddhist education

There were no caste restrictions during Buddhist and Jain
periods. That also impacted choice of language.
Sanskrit was used all the times.

Role of Rulers and Emperors in Expansion of Buddhism

1. Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (304-232 BcE): His
extensive patronage of Buddhism led to the establish-
ment and development of monastic and educational
centres across his empire.

2. Gupta Dynasty Rulers (320-550 ce): Their era is
usually referred as ‘Golden Era’. Gupta period is often
associated with the flourishing of Nalanda University.

3. Pala Dynasty Rulers (750-1174 cE): The Palas
were instrumental in the establishment of prominent
Buddhist centres that later evolved into major educa-

tional institutions:
¢® Vikramashila University: | Founded by
Dharmapala.

«© Somapura Mahavihara: Another significant cen-
tre of learning established during the Pala dynasty.
4. Kanishka the Great (78-101 cE) of the Kushan
Empire: His reign, however, significantly contributed
to the spread of Buddhism, which led to the growth of
educational centres across his empire.
5. Harsha Vardhana (590-647 cE): His patronage of
both Buddhism and Hinduism supported the growth
of learning centres in northern India during his time.

-: ANS RETR

During the continuous Islamic invasions, many education cen-
tres in northern India were destroyed. This actually resulted
to a shift of the Vedic system of education to the South.

1. Vedic Education in the South: Under the patronage of
the Vijayanagara rulers, Vedic scholars like Sayana and
Madhava wrote extensive commentaries on the Vedas.

2. Islamic Education: The Muslim ruling elite focuse,
on urban education, establishing libraries and literary
societies. They founded primary schools called mak.
tabs (44) for basic education in reading, Writin
and Islamic prayers, and secondary schools calje
madrasas for advanced language and religious styg
ies. Often attached to mosques, these Islamic schog|,
were primarily for boys, with girls from affluent fam;
lies receiving education at home.

3. Mughal Era Education: Persian was the court lan.
guage during the Mughal era. Elite boys attendeg
Persian schools to learn literature, history, ethics
law, administration, and court protocol. Sufi retreats /
(khanqah - GMs) were centres for spreading mystic
doctrines and ideas. :

4. Sanskrit and Other Forms of Education: Sanskrit.
academies continued teaching young Brahman males.
in literature and law. Apprenticeship and commercia] _
schools trained boys in business skills.

5. Education for Girls: Education for girls was rare and.
mostly limited to domestic spheres or home-based.
learning, especially in affluent families.

This period shows a diversification of educational sys-
tems, with traditional Vedic education coexisting with
Islamic and later Mughal influences, each contributing
uniquely to the educational landscape of India.

comes that manifest as desired changes in the real world.

Thus, formulation and implementation of policies are
important to us. The British system moved through a com-

Ficure 10.2 Factors Relating to Policy Formation in Education Sector

Decision-Making and Guidance: Education policy can
be an explicit or implicit decision or set of decisions. These
decisions provide directives for future actions, initiate or
retard certain activities, and guide the implementation of
prior decisions.

Policy, therefore, represents a strategic course of action
rather than day-to- day decisions or actions. It is perceived
by analysts as a long-term, strategic approach to man-
aging and improving education. The given aspects are
important.

1. Problem Identification: Recognizing and defining
the educational issues or challenges that need to be
addressed.

2. Policy Formation: Developing policies to address the
identified problems.

3. Decision-Making: Making choices and decisions tar-
geting the identified problems.

4, Implementation: Executing the plan or applying the
policy in a practical setting.

5. Analysis and Evaluation: Continuously assessing
the policy to determine its effectiveness and deciding
whether to continue, modify, or terminate it.

Pre-INDEPENDENCE SCENARIO IN EDUCATION IN
INDIA

The basic motivations for setting up modern education
system in India were the following:

° British Influence: Modern education in India started
under British rule, primarily to create a class of edu-
cated Indians who could assist in administrative tasks.

* Role of Christian Missionaries: They played a key
. role in spreading modern education, often focusing
on English language and Western sciences.

¢ Contribution of Indian Intellectuals and
Reformers: Indian leaders and reformers advocated
for education reform, blending traditional Indian
knowledge with modern subjects.

Epucarion Durine Bartisn Era

1. Calcutta Madrassa (1781): This was established by.

Warren Hastings in 1781 for teaching Muslim law:
That actually marked a significant step in formal edu-
cation under British rule. Asiatic Society of Bengal
was set up in 1784.
2. Sanskrit College in Banaras (Varanasi)(1791):

Founded by Jonathan Duncan in 1791, this college

focused on the study of Hindu philosophy and law,
indicating an interest in traditional Indian learning
systems.

Fort William College was set up in 1800.
Charter Act of 1813: This act marked the first gov-
ernment initiative towards education in India, leading
to debates about whether education should adhere to
traditional methods or embrace modernity.

4. Hindu College of Calcutta (1817): Raja Ram Mohan
Roy played an important role in the establishment ’

of this prestigious college. This institution was later
renamed as Presidency College in 1855 when it was
taken over by the British government and made into
a government institution. This college was upgraded
into Presidency University in 2010.

5. Senate of Serampore College (University) (1818):
This institution was indeed founded in 1818 and was
granted the status of a university in 1829, making it
the oldest university in India that is still in operation.
It was established primarily for theological education
and later expanded to other fields.

6. Mountstuart Elphinstone’s Minutes (1823):
Elphinstone’s proposal in 1823 emphasized the need



=== Page 80 ===
+ for schools to teach English and European sciences,
laying the groundwork for modern education in India.
. sanskrit College, Calcutta (1824): This college was
set up under the patronage of Lord Amherst. Ishwar
Chander Vidyasagar joined this college in 1841. He
advocated to include English and Bengali as mediums
of instruction alongside Sanskrit. He campaigned
against Sati Pratice that officially ended in 1856.
Earlier Raja Ram Mohan Roy also campaigned against
Sati Practice. Lord William Bentick officially ended
that Sati practice in Bengal in 1829.

. Lord Macaulay’s Minutes (1835): Lord Macaulay
advocated for educating Indians in English language
and literature in 1835, aiming to create a class of
English-educated Indians.

. Introduction of English as Medium of Instruction
(1835): Under Lord William Bentinck, the decision
to introduce English as the medium of instruction
marked the beginning of a significant shift in Indian
education, particularly targeting the upper and mid-
dle classes with the ‘Infiltration Theory’.

Infiltration Theory: This was basically a ‘trickle
down’. Western education and values would gradu-
ally spread from an initially loyal elite class to the
wider population, serving both administrative con-
venience and cultural influence. The British wanted
that their ‘White Man’s Burden’ (a phrase coined by
Rudyard Kipling) to dominate the Indian masses, so
that their rule is long term. We may add social -cul-
ture dominance to this.

Charles Trevelyan, a British official, believed Indian
education should include both local and Western
elements. To him education should be inclusive, so
local culture and literature were important. He pre-
sented these ideas in his his 1838 publication, ‘On the
Education of the People of India.’

.Founding of Elphinstone College and Calcutta
Medical College (1835): Elphinstone College was
named after Mountstuart Elphinstone, the then
Governor of Bombay. Calcutta Medical College was
the first institution in Asia for the study of western
medicine. Both represent the expansion of English
education in India, in liberal arts and medical sciences.
. Sir Charles Wood’s Dispatch (1854): Termed the
‘Magna Carta of English Education in India,’ this dis-
patch advocated a comprehensive education system
from primary schools to universities, emphasizing

13. Aligarh Muslim University (1875): Sir Syed Ahmed
Khan founded the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental Col-
lege to promote modern education for Muslims. This
college was later upgraded into a Aligarh Muslim Uni-
versity.

14. Vernacular Press Act (1878): This act aimed to
control the content published in newspapers and
magazines printed in languages other than English.
it proved to be highly controversial, sparking wide-
spread protests and criticism. This opposition ulti-
mately led to the Act's repeal in 1882.

15. Establishment of Punjab University (1882): This
university was established in 1882 in Lahore (now in
Pakistan) to cater to the education needs of people of
Punjab, and also to reduce the workload and admin-
istrative burden of University of Calcutta, which was
established in 1857. Punjab University in Chandigarh
was established in 1958-1960. Punjab University is
not a central university. It's a state university, jointly
funded by the governments of Punjab and Haryana in
an inter-state body corporate, with Punjab contribut-
ing higher funds. The location of this university in the
UT, that is also joint capital of Punjab and Haryana
raises some questions about the status.

16. Indian Education Commission/Hunter Commission °

(1882-83): This commission recommended the seg-
regation of primary and higher education, leading to
specific focus areas in the education system.

17. Allahabad University (1887): The location of this
university was renamed as Prayagraj. This is often
referred to as the "Oxford of the East" during the
British era. Allahabad University was significantly
influenced by Sir William Muir, who was the Lt.
Governor of United Provinces at the time. Initially, he
laid the foundation for Muir Central College (named
after him) in 1873, which subsequently became an
integral part of the prestigious Allahabad University.

Commission, headed by Sir Thomas Raleigh, was
indeed appointed in 1902 to investigate and recom-
mend reforms for higher education in India.

° Curzon Universities Act of 1902: Lord Curzon's Act
did lay the groundwork for reform by introducing
measures like centralized control, affiliation of col-
leges, and standardized examinations.

° Indian Universities Act of 1904: This Act built upon
the 1902 Act by providing more detailed legislative
implementation of the Raleigh Commission's recom-
mendations. It further strengthened government con-
trol, mandated teaching, and promoted research in

universities. There was some critical reaction on this
act by nationalist leaders.

21. National Council of Education (1905): Established
by Swadeshi nationalist leaders, this council aimed to
promote indigenous education systems and values.
This initiative led to the establishment of institutions
like Jadavpur University.

22. Indian Institute of Science (1909): Though founded
in the British era, IISc in Bangalore became a leading
institution for scientific research and higher educa-
tion in India after independence.

23. Rabindranath Tagore’s Educational Initiatives:
Tagore set up the Shanti Niketan institutions, and
later, in 1921, Vishwa Bharati University. These insti-
tutions were aimed at providing holistic education
and promoting Indian culture and values. Vishwa
Bharati University is now recognized as an ‘Institution
of National Importance,’ uniquely having the Prime
Minister of India as its Chancellor.

24. Education Policy Resolution (1913): This resolu-
tion marked another step in the evolution of educa-
tion policy in India. ‘

cation and cultural preservation.

26. Calcutta University Commission/Sadler Commission
(1917): The Sadler Commission recommended the sep-
aration of intermediate education from degree colleges
and advocated for greater autonomy for universities’
teaching bodies. These reforms aimed to improve the
quality and governance of higher education.

27. Morley-Minto Reforms (1919): Part of these
reforms included the transfer of authority over edu-
cation to provincial levels and Indian ministers, under
the ‘diarchy’ system. This allowed for more local and
Indian involvement in the management of education.

28, Jamia Millia Islamis (1920): This institution was
founded as an expression of nationalist aspirations
within the Muslim community. It sought to provide
a platform for modern education while preserving
Islamic culture and identity.

29, Precursor to the 10+2+3 System: The reforms and
recommendations during this period set the stage for
the eventual adoption of the 10+2+3 system of edu-
cation, comprising 10 years of schooling followed by
two years of higher secondary education and three
years of university education.

30. Establishment of CABE : The Central Advisory Board
of Education (CABE) was first established in 1920. It is

Expansion of Educational Infrastructure: That
happened in terms of expansion of schools, colleges
and universities. .

Emphasis on Scientific Research: These led to the
setting up of specialized institutions like IITs (Indian
Institutes of Technology) and IISc (Indian Institute of
Science).

Development of Indigenous Curriculum: To reso-
nate with India’s cultural and intellectual heritage,
while also incorporating modern, global perspectives.
Increased Government Support: The initiatives
such as establishment of UGC (University Grants
Commission) and CSIR (Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research).

Growth of Technical and Management Education:
This happened with the establishment of various IITs,
NITs (National Institutes of Technology), and IIMs
(Indian Institutes of Management).

Focus on Liberal Arts and Social Sciences: To
deal with diversity, there was a focus on liberal arts,
humanities, and social sciences, reflecting a holistic
approach to higher education.

Private Sector Participation: Post-liberalization,
the private sector started playing a significant role in
‘higher education, leading to the establishment of pri-
vate universities and colleges.

Global Collaboration and Research: There was
increased collaboration with foreign universities for
research, faculty exchange, and student exchange
programs.

Digital Education and Online Learning: Recent
years have seen a surge in digital education and
online learning platforms, broadening access to

1.

Education as a Shared Responsibility of Centre and
State: This idea was proposed when India’s Constitu-
tion was being written. But the Constituent Assembly,
which was making the Constitution, preferred that
such issues should be managed by states. Eventually,
acompromise was made. While education was mainly



=== Page 83 ===
10.18

a state matter, the Constitution gave some powers to
the central government too.

2. India adopted the following changes to a more orga-
nized approach, keeping in view the Commission’s
work and suggestions:

¢ Entry 63: The central government controls big
institutions like the National Library in Kolkata
and major universities like BHU, AMU, and Delhi
University.

e Entry 64: This is about the central government’s
role in managing big scientific and technical edu-
cation institutions like IITs.

¢ Entry 65: The central government can set up and
manage institutions for professional, vocational,
or technical training, including science and tech
institutions.

* Entry 66: The most important one for education
quality. It’s about the central government’s job to
coordinate and set standards for higher education
and research institutions, ensuring they all meet
high-quality benchmarks.

e Under Entry 66, key regulatory bodies like the
UGC, AICTE, National Medical Commission
(formerly Medical Council of India as of 2019),
Nursing Council, CAR, Pharmacy Council of India,
Institute of Architects, Institute of Accountancy,
and the Bar Council of India were established.

UGC and Grants-in-Aid (1952): In 1952, the Indian gov-
ernment decided that the University Grants Commission
(UGC) would handle all matters related to grants-in-
aid for central universities and other higher education

on December 28, 1953.

Formal Establishment of UGC (1956): The UGC was
formally established as a statutory body in November
1956 through an Act of Parliament. Its main role is to

| universities. There are fears that a one-size-fits-all
| approach that might not cater to the specific needs
| of diverse institutions.

| Four Verticals of HECI: HECI will function through
technology-driven interventions and have the power
to penalize non-conforming institutions. HECI can
be thought of as a four-armed octopus, each arm
handling a different task:

1. National Higher Education Regulatory
Council (NHERC): The rule-maker, NHERC is
to set academic standards, approving institu-
tions, and monitoring compliance. This will
exclude medical and legal education.

2. National Accreditation Council (NAC): This
is actually the quality checker. Here, the "meta-
accrediting" term accurately reflects its role in
overseeing a network of independent accredit-
ing bodies. Accreditation wouldn't solely rely
on basic norms and self-disclosure. NAC would
also consider factors such as good governance,
student outcomes, employability, and research
output. ‘

3. National Higher Education Funding Council
(NHEFC): NHEFC is responsible for allocating
funding to institutions based on. performance
and national priorities. This NHEFC is some-
times referred as HEGC (Higher Education
Grants Council).

4. National Institute for Higher Education
Management (NIHEM): The curriculum boss,

designing what you learn and setting learning

goals. This is responsible for capacity building
of faculty and administrators, and providing
research and policy support.

. Phasing Out Affiliation System: The affiliation of
colleges will be phased out in 15 years, with graded
autonomy granted to colleges.

5. Increase in Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER): GER in
higher education will be taised to 50% by 2035, with the
addition of 3.5 crore seats. The current GER is 26.3%.

6. Teacher Education: The progress on new National
Curriculum Framework for Teacher Education
(NCFTE) is in progress. By 2030, the minimum quali-
fication for teaching will be a 4-year integrated B.Ed.
degree. The more stringent standards are to be set.

7. Integration of Professional Education: This will
becomie an integral part of higher education, and
standalone technical, health science, legal, and agri-
cultural universities will aim for multidisciplinarity.

8. Increased Investment: The Centre and States will
work together to increase public investment in educa-
‘tion to reach 6% of GDP at the earliest.

Other Changes

1. National Educational Technology Forum (NETF):
An autonomous body will be created to promote the
use of technology (mainly digital) in education.

2. PARAKH (Performance Assessment, Review, and
Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development):
This assessment center will evaluate students and
open avenues for foreign universities to establish
campuses in India. ;

3. Gender Inclusion Fund (GIF) and Special Education
Zones (SEZs): Emphasis will be placed on promoting
gender inclusion and addressing educational disparities
in disadvantaged regions and among various groups.

4. Virtual Labs: Existing e-learning platforms will be
leveraged to create virtual labs for practical and
hands-on learning experiences.

and Prakrit. It will help keep India’s language her-
itage alive.

3. National Institute for Classical Languages
(NICL): To focus on India’s classical languages
like Sanskrit and Tamil. It will offer courses on
these languages.

4. Multidisciplinary Education and Research
Universities (MERUs): These new universities
will focus on different subjects. These universi-
ties, equivalent to IITs and IIMs, will be set up as
models of multidisciplinary education.

5. National Research Foundation (NRF): This
will fund research across all subjects. It will help
researchers work together and make India a
leader in research.

6. National Institute for Teacher Education

(NITE): This institute will create new teaching”

methods and supervise teacher training.

7. National Institute for Tribal Research (NITR):
This institute will research issues important to
tribal communities, like education and health.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF HIGHER
_ Epucarion In Inpia

This involves multiple layers of governance and coordina-
ion between the Central and State governments. Here is
he basic description.

1. Central Government: This is responsible for laying

viding grants to the UGC, setting up central univer-
sities and institutions of national importance, and
declaring educational institutions as ‘Deemed-to-be
universities’ based on UGC recommendations.

2. State Government: Many states have established
state councils and advisory boards for higher educa-
tion. These bodies provide guidelines for the func-
tioning of higher education institutions and coordi-
nate the roles of government, universities, and apex
regulatory agencies within the state.

3. Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE): This
board facilitates coordination and cooperation, thus
acts as a bridge between the central and state gov-
ernments in education planning, policy making and
implementation.

Asout Universities

1. The word ‘University’ is derived from the Latin word
‘Universitas’, meaning ‘a whole’. This means a special-
ized association of students and teachers. This institu-
tion of higher learning produces the product for vari-
ous fields, aiming to impart knowledge and wisdom
for personality development.

The main functions of a University are as follows:
e Instruction provision

e Conducting research and postgraduate studies
e Affiliation and extension services to colleges

2. Basic Scenario of University Education In India:

e Defined as institutions established under central,
provincial, or state acts, recognized by UGC.

e Possess degree-granting authority and conduct
examinations.

e Autonomy in fee structure and curriculum design.
e Affiliating authority for colleges within their geo-
graphical region.
3. Degree-Granting Colleges:
e Autonomy in admissions

e Adherence to affiliated university standards for
fees, examinations, and curriculum

State Universities are established through Provincial or
State Acts. These universities are listed under Section
12(B) of the UGC Act, 1956, qualifying them for central
assistance.

° Development Grants: They receive development
grants and funds from special schemes to enhance
infrastructure, supplementing state government
support.

° Role of State Governments: While the primary fund-
ing responsibility lies with state governments, central
grants address funding gaps.

° Significance in Higher Education: State universi-
ties represent a significant portion of total universi-
ties in India and account for the majority of student
enrollment.

Private Universities in India

They are established through a state or central act by a
sponsoring body such as a registered society, public trust,
or company.

° Private universities can award degrees as per Section
22 of the UGC Act, subject to approval from statutory
councils for specific programs.

e The first private university in India, Sikkim Manipal
University of Health, Medical and Technological
Sciences, was established in Gangtok in 1995.

° They play a crucial role in diversifying and expanding
higher education, often introducing innovative pro-
grams and teaching methods.

Deemed-To-be Universities

A ‘deemed-to-be university,’ also commonly referred to as
a ‘deemed university,’ is an institution recognized for its
exceptional performance, officially designated by the cen-
tral government under Section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956.
Deemed universities can only attain approval through an
executive order following a recommendation from the
UGC. Although they possess all the powers of a typical
university, they lack the authority to affiliate colleges.

Historical Instances: The Indian Institute of Science
(IISc) in Bengaluru and the Indian Agricultural Research
Institute in Delhi were among the pioneering institutions
to be conferred with deemed status. The IISc achieved
this status in 1958, despite its establishment in 1908.
Additionally, the Manipal Academy of Higher Education
(MAHE) became the first private institution to attain
deemed university status in 1976.

Main Examples: Notable examples of deemed-to-be

-universities include:

° National University of Educational Planning and
Administration (NUEPA), located in New Delhi.

e Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, based in New Delhi.

e Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit
Vidyapeetha, situated in New Delhi.

° Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, located in Tirupati.

Additional Information

° The states with the highest number of universities are

Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.

e The 11th Five-Year Plan aimed to establish 14 world-
class central universities, later renamed as innovative
universities striving for world-class standards.

° In 2009, the P. N. Tandon Committee recommended
the blacklisting of 44 deemed universities due to their
perceived lack of required quality.

® Jn 2015, the UGC requested that 10 deemed universities,
including BITS Pilani, close their off-campus centers.

° In February 2016, the UGC amended its regulations,
allowing private deemed universities to have up to six
off-campuses. However, this limitation did not apply
to government-established and managed deemed
universities.

Funding: Deemed universities, along with central univer-
sities and institutions of national importance, primarily
receive funding from the federal government through the
UGC, with the National Open University being directly
funded by the Central government: ,

Meta University

This concept was initiated by UGC in India, represents an
innovative approach to higher education. These are key
points:

1. Second-Generation Universities: Meta Universities
go beyond traditional education models, focusing
on interdisciplinary studies and integrating various
knowledge domains.

2. Virtual Operation: They are not restricted by physi-
cal locations, operating mainly through digital plat-
forms, thus offering greater access and flexibility.

3. Innovation and Flexibility Focus: These universi-
ties are adaptable, embracing new teaching methods,
research areas, and technology.

The University of Delhi and Jamia Millia Islamia were the
first in India to adopt this model, starting a joint ‘Master
of Mathematics Education’ program in 2015, showcasing
collaboration and interdisciplinary education.

Institutes of Eminence (IOE)

India lacks in international rankings. There are different
reasons for that. Over a period, the government has done
many efforts to supplement the gap.

The Institutes of Eminence scheme comes under the
Ministry of Education to project Indian institutes to get global
recognition. The selected institutes will enjoy complete aca-
demic and administrative autonomy. The selection shall be
made through challenge method mode by the Empowered
Expert Committee (EEC) constituted for the purpose.

The ranking of institutions has been done by the UGC
as per the recommendations of QS-2020 World Rankings.

Objectives

e Excellence and innovation

° Specialization (distinctive contributions)
° Global rating

¢ Quality teaching and research

Criteria for setting up of IOEs

Eligibility: Only higher education institutions currently
placed in the top 500 of global rankings or top 50 of the
National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) are eli-
gible to apply for the eminence tag.

The private IOE can also come up as greenfield ventures,
provided that the sponsoring organisation submits a con-
vincing perspective plan for 15 years. Private institutions
will not get any financial support, but they will be entitled
for more autonomy as a special category Deemed University.

The greenfield institutions would get a period of 3
years to establish and operationalize the institution.

The UGC has nominated 20 institutions (10 public and 10
private institutions) for IOE in August 2019. The initial rankings
have 15 institutions each from public and private sector.

The top three declared IOE from the public sector are
the following:

1. IIT Bombay (IND
2. IIT Delhi GND
3. IISC, Bengaluru (deemed university)
The top three declared IOE from the private sector are
the following:
1. BITS Pilani, Rajasthan
2. MAHE

| Classical Languages
| Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and
| Odia are the six classical languages in India. Tamil
| was the first language to be assigned the status of
| classical language in 2004. Odia was the last one to |
| be assigned the status in February 2014, but itis the |
| first language from the Indo-Aryan linguistic group

| to be assigned the status.
| The Sahitya Academy’s Expert Committee gave
| the following four criteria for a classical language:

1. There should be high antiquity of early texts/
recorded history of over 1500-2000 years.

2. There should be a body of ancient literature/
texts that is considered a valuable heritage by
generations of speakers.

3. The literary tradition should be original and not
borrowed from another speech community.

4. The classical language and literature should be
distinct from the modern and there may also be
a discontinuity between the classical language
and its later forms of offshoots.

The proposals are made by the Ministry of Culture.
Once a language is declared classical, it gets finan-
cial assistance for setting up a centre of excellence
for the study of that language and also opens up an
avenue for two major awards for scholars of emi-
nence. Besides, the UGC can be requested to create
to begin with at least in central universities a certain
number of professional chairs for classical languages
for scholars of eminence in that language.

The fathers of the Constitution conferred
Sanskrit special status by Article 351 as it was
the primary source language for many languages
including Hindi. .

Five languages in the world, namely, Chinese,
Sanskrit, Arabic, Greek and Latin, have been assigned
the status of classical languages.

Implications:

e Autonomy: Institutes with IOE tag will be given greater
autonomy and freedom to decide fees, course durations
and governance structures to enable them to vault of the
top global institutions. They would be able to admit for-
eign students and recruit faculty from abroad.

° Grant: The public institutions under IOE tag will receive
a government grant of 71000 crore, while the private
institutions will not get any funding under the scheme.

1. Which of the following statements applies in the con.
text of institutions selected as Institute of Eminence?

1. The institute enjoys complete academic and
administrative autonomy. :

2. The ranking of institutions has been done by the.
UGC as per the recommendations of QS-2029

- Accreditation is a. crucial mechanism for assessing and
assuring the quality of higher education institutions and
programs. In India, several accreditation bodies play a
vital role in maintaining standards and promoting excel-
lence across diverse disciplines.

NATIONAL ASSESSMENT AND Accrepitation CouNciL

(NAAC)

e NAAC was established by the UGC in 1994, headquar-
tered in Bengaluru.

» NAAC was created following the recommendations of
the National Policy on Education (NPE) 1986.

IER

t up ° NAAC’s main role is to assess and accredit higher edu-
lage cation institutions, including universities, colleges,
‘the departments, schools, and programs.

10.33

e NAAC regularly publishes manuals and materials
to guide institutions through the assessment and
accreditation process.

Narionat Boarp of Accreortarion (NBA)

e NBA is an autonomous body set up in 1994 by the All
India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).

© This conducts evaluations of technical courses in
India. ;

e NBA has the power to recognize or derecognize insti-
tutions or programs.

e The accreditation process by the NBA is not directly
linked to funding.

Accreoitation Boarp (AB)

e AB was established by the Indian Council of
Agricultural Research (ICAR) in 1996.

e AB is responsible for accrediting agricultural
institutions.

° The validity of AB Accreditation ranges from 5 to 10
years and is linked to funding based on the number of
accredited institutions.

State-Speciric MANDATES
e Accreditation is generally voluntary in India, but
states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have made it
mandatory for professional institutions.
° Despite the importance, accreditation rates remain
low. Only 36% of engineering and 10% of manage-
ment programs are NBA accredited.

Open anp Distance Learning (ODL)

ODL in India, as outlined by the Ministry of Education
plays a pivotal role in expanding the reach and accessibil-
ity of education. The key points are as follows:

1. Nature and Objectives of ODL: ODL is a part of
non-conventional education where physical presence
of teachers and learners at the same place and time
is not necessary. It offers flexibility in teaching and
learning methods, timings, and admission criteria,
while maintaining quality standards.

The primary goals include democratizing higher edu-
cation, providing innovative university-level educa-
tion, offering opportunities for skill upgradation and |
qualifications, and fostering lifelong learning.

2, Philosophy of ODL: Open learning focuses on mini-

mizing restrictions to maximize openness in educa-
tion. It is an educational philosophy aiming to make
learning accessible to more people.
Distance education operationalizes the philosophy of
open learning. It encompasses all teaching and learn-
ing where the learner and the teacher are separated
by space and time.

3. Communication’ Methods: The curriculum interac-
tion takes place in an interesting manner. In distance



=== Page 99 ===
10.34

learning, curriculum is mostly delivered through self-
study materials. Technology plays a crucial role in
facilitating this.

The Interaction between institutions, teachers, and
learners is predominantly through electronic media
like telephone, interactive radio counselling, telecon-
ferencing, video conferencing, chat sessions, email,
and websites. Postal correspondence and limited
face-to-face sessions at study centres are also used.

4. India’s Position in DE: India has one of the largest
distance education systems in the world, second only
to China.

5. Types of DE Institutions in India:

1. National Open University: For example, the
Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU
is a prominent institution. .
2. State Open Universities: These are open univer-
sities established by various state governments.
3. Distance Education Institutions (DEIs)

HisToRICAL Perspective of Distance Epucation
IN. INDIA

The below is the pointwise historical journey of Distance
Education in India.

e 1962: Delhi University started the ‘School of
Correspondence Courses and Continuing Education’.
This was the start of distance education in higher edu-
cation in India.

° Late 1960s: More universities like Punjabi University,
Rajasthan University, Meerut University and Mysore
University joined the journey by offering similar courses
to cater to the demand of correspondence courses.

e Education Commission (1964-66): The Kothari
Commission recognized correspondence courses as a
way to support more students and ease financial pres-
sure on traditional universities.

* 1970s: Distance education spread across India, mak-
ing education more accessible.

° 1980s & National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986:
The government introduced the Open University System
(OUS) and the NPE emphasized OUS for expanding
higher education opportunities. There was establish-
ment of pioneering institutions like Dr. B.R. Ambedkar
Open University in Hyderabad (1982) and the Indira
Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) (1985).

Role of Distance Education Council (DEC) and
Transition to UGC
° 1991 & DEC Establishment: The Distance Education
Council was established under the IGNOU Act, becom.
ing operational in 1992. It was tasked with Promotin
and coordinating Open and Distance Learning (ODL)
in India. ;
¢ Regulatory Shift (2010-2012): A committee chaired
by Prof. Madhava Menon was formed by the Ministry
of Human Resource Development (MHRD) to regu-

late standards in distance education. It recommended

the creation of a new regulatory body, the Distance
Education Council of India (DECI), and proposed shift.
ing DEC's responsibilities from IGNOU to the UGC. By
2013, the UGC took over these functions under the
newly formed Distance Education Bureau (DEB).

° 2014 Onwards: The Ministry of Education directed
the UGC to regulate all higher education in Opy,
mode, including technical education. The UGC, under
the DEB, is now the primary regulatory body for dis.
tance and open learning in India, ensuring the main-
tenance of standards and quality in universities and
affiliated colleges.

° Thus, the landscape of distance education has evolved
significantly from its inception in 1962, reflecting a
dynamic and responsive approach to the educational
needs of the country.

Inpira Gano Nationa Open University (IGNOU) -

° IGNOU is a central university located in New Delhi,
India, specializing in distance and open education. This
was established in 1985 to provide quality higher edu-
cation opportunities to all segments of society through
distance and open learning. With over 4 million active
students, IGNOU is the largest university globally.

° IGNOU offers a diverse array of programs, from aca-
demic to technical, professional, and vocational at
various levels.

° InternationalCollaboration: HoststheSecretariatsof
the SAARC Consortium on Open and Distance Learning
(SACODiL) and the Global Mega Universities Network
(GMUNET), with initial support from UNESCO.

° Use of ICTs: Extensively uses Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs) for education.
Utilizes self-instructional materials, audio/video tapes,
teleconferencing, Gyan Vani (FM Radio), Gyan Darshan
(educational TV channels), and computer networks.

° SAKSHAT Portal: Operates the ‘One Stop Education
’ Portal SAKSHAT’.

e Decentralization Process: Initiated decentraliza-
tion by setting up five zones: north, south, east, west,
and north-east, with 10% of the budget allocated for
northeastern states. ~

¢ Dual Role: Functions both as an Open University
and as a promoter and coordinator of the Open and
Distance Education system in India.

ernment.

There is a huge demand for professional, technical and
skill development education in the modern age of science
and technology. The new role for educational institutions
found it necessary to redefine its goal mainly related to
economic development and to ensure a place for India in
the community of prosperous nations.

A profession is a vocation founded upon specialized
educational training, the purpose of which is to supply
counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite
compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other
business gain.

A profession arises when any trade or occupation
transforms itself through ‘the development of formal
qualifications based on education, apprenticeship, and
examinations, the emergence of regulatory bodies with
powers to admit and discipline members, and some
degree of monopoly rights.’

The need for professional education has only increased
with changing needs of society and economy.

The professional regulatory. bodies grant approval for
establishment of institutes and determine standards for
the same. Some of the specialized professional bodies are
Medical Council of India, Dental Council of India, Council
of Architecture, the details of which are mentioned on
page 10.23.

Thus, a significant part of the Indian higher education
system is regulated. However, there are certain areas that
are not.



=== Page 101 ===
NEES ES % cos
Technical education imparts knowledge ofa a specific trade,
craft or profession. It can meet the increasing demands
of expanding society and it is multiplying demands and
development.

To train our students/professionals in response to the
need of the time, our education system must be reor-
ganized to give it the necessary practical and technical
bias. The Government of India is also very keen for uni-
versal recognition of our education-system, and because
of that, all universities are trying hard to get the NBA
accreditation.

We find that in a zeal to cope with the advancement
of science and technology, our technical education system
has become primarily skill-oriented and almost deficient
or casual in the education in human values.

TECHNICAL EoucaTION SCENARIO IN INDIA

In India, technical education covers programmes in engi-
neering, technology, management, architecture, town
planning, pharmacy, applied arts and crafts, and hotel
management and catering technology.

1. The first engineering college was established in Uttar
Pradesh in 1847 for training of civil engineers at Roor-
kee. It conferred diplomas that were considered to be
equivalent to degrees.

2. Three engineering colleges were opened by about
1856 in three presidencies, namely, Calcutta, Bombay
and Madras.

3. In Bengal, the leaders of the Swadeshi Movement tried
to start many institutions. However, only the College of
Engineering and Technology at Jadavpur survived.

4, Many technical courses were started at the University

of Banaras with great efforts put by Pandit Madan -

Mohan Malviya (1917).

5, Many other courses were also started at the Bengal
Engineering College at Shibpur in the 1930s.

6. A number of engineering colleges were established
since 15 August 1947. It was due to the realization
that India had to become a great industrial country
and would require a large number of engineers than
could be supplied by the older institutions.

Value education is an integral part of the educational
framework, aimed at the holistic development of individ-
uals and society. Here’s a summary of key developments
and perspectives in value education in India:
¢ Broader Aim of Value Education:
1. Individual’s Perspective: Achieving personal
fulfillment and success in life and work.
2. Societal Perspective: Preparing youth to con-
tribute positively to society, the nation, and the
world.

° Historical Perspective: Plato’s view in ‘The Republie

highlights the role of educated individuals in using
their knowledge to solve societal problems.

THe Neep ror Vatue Epucation

The need for imparting value education arises from sey.
eral contemporary issues and societal changes. Here are
the main issues:

1.

Tradition versus Modernity: We need to strike a bal.
ance between traditional values and modernization.
Value education helps young learners appreciate posj-
tive aspects of tradition, such as tolerance, harmony,
and collectivism, while also embracing beneficia]
aspects of modernization.

. Globalization: With societies becoming increasingly

multicultural, individuals must learn to navigate a
complex and diverse global environment. Value edu-
cation can help in understanding and respecting dif-
ferent cultures.

. Diversity: Balancing universality and diversity, is a

challenge in a democratic and diverse society. Value
education promotes respect and understanding of
various cultural, social, and religious backgrounds.

. Inclusivity: A healthy society is inclusive, making all

members feel valued and involved. Value education
fosters a sense of belonging and acceptance among
individuals.

. Environmental Concerns: Issues like global warm-.

ing, pollution, deforestation, and soil erosion high-
light the need for environmental consciousness.
Value education emphasizes the ethical responsibility
towards sustainable environmental practices.

. Explosion of Science and Technology: The ethical

use of science and technology is critical. Value educa-
tion addresses the moral and ethical responsibilities
associated with the application of scientific and tech-
nological advancements.

. Impact of Mass and Social Media: The pervasive -

influence of media in daily life often transmits values
and attitudes contrary to those upheld by families,
schools, and society. Value education helps individu-
als critically evaluate media content and its impact on
values and behaviour.

Key DEVELOPMENTS IN VALUE EDUCATION

1.

National Commission of Secondary Education
(1952-53): Emphasized character building as the
primary goal of education.

. University Education Commission (1962):.

Highlighted the importance of spiritual training in
educational institutions.

. Education Commission (1964-66): Focused on

education for national development and recom-
mended direct moral instruction in schools.

. National Policy on Education (NPE, 1986):

Advocated using education as a tool for cultivat-
ing social and moral values, emphasizing unity and
integration.

education.

Chavan’s Committee Report (1999): Gave impetus
to focus on the value orientation of education.
National Curriculum Framework for School
Education (2000): Made a plea to integrate value
education into the curriculum.

National Curriculum Framework (2005): Reaf-
firmed commitment to equality, diversity, and mutual
interdependence, emphasizing education for peace as
a crucial national and global concern.

These developments reflect the evolving understand-
ing and incorporation of value education in India’s edu-
cational system, recognizing its importance in shaping
responsible, ethical, and socially conscious individuals.

_Let’s start with an example, India has a large higher
education system but no Indian institutions ranked in the
_top 200 globally. That indicates need for improvement

10.4

in areas like research, reputation, and faculty quality as

discussed above also. Thus, governance does matter.
Governance marks a shift from traditional government

paradigms, indicating a new process or method of govern-

-ing, or a transformed state of structured ruling. It involves

the various ways society is managed and organized.

Diverse INTERPRETATIONS OF GOVERNANCE

* Minimal State: Refers to a governance model where
the state plays a limited role, intervening only when
necessary.

* Corporate Governance: Involves the structures and
processes for the direction and control of companies.

° New Public Management: A perspective that empha-
sizes efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in
the public sector.

®* Good Governance: Entails effective, transparent,
accountable, and ethical management in the public
sector.

° International Interdependence: Governance as shaped
by global interdependencies and international relations.

* Socio-Cybernetic System: Viewing governance as a
complex, adaptive system that involves social dynam-
ics and information feedback loops.

° Networks: Governance through collaborative net-
works and decentralized decision-making.

Goop GovERNANCE In Higher EpucaTion

1, Collaborative Governance Framework: Governance
in education brings together UGC, universities, NAAC,
NBA, and key institutions. They work together through
dialogue and partnership. The stated principles are
democratic but then decision making is cumbersome.

2. Principles of Good Governance: This focuses on imple-
menting educational policies effectively and fairly. It is
based on past reforms and the New Education Policy.
The goal is to improve both public life and education.

3. Strategic Restructuring and Collaboration: This
involves reshaping government bodies to focus on
social goals. It also means working together with the
state, private sector, NGOs, and community groups.
The approach uses diverse strategies, like socio-
cybernetic systems and networks.

4. Societal Impact and Development: Good gover-
nance in education is crucial for society’s growth.
It supports a balanced role for the state in making
impactful educational changes and policies.

ORGANIZATIONAL StTrucTURE OF Universimes in INDIA

1. Historical Roots: India has strong roots of education.
Ancient Indian education was influenced by Vedanta,
Buddhism, and Jainism. This era led to India being
known as Jagat Guru’. The government aims to retain
elements of this ancient system in modern education.

2. British Influence: The current university system has
its origins in British colonial rule.

° Early Institutions: There is a big list of establish-
ments such as Calcutta Madrasa (1781), Asiatic
Society of Bengal (1784), Banaras Sanskrit



=== Page 107 ===
10.42

College (1791) among others which were
founded during this period.

° British Parliament’s Role: The Charter Act of
1813 declared Indian education a duty of the state.

e Macaulay’s Minute of 1835: This gave priority to
British-style education in India.

° Establishment of Universities: In 1857, universi-

. ties in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras were estab-

lished, modeled on the University of London. The
University of Allahabad, established in 1887, was
more graduate-focused.

¢ Cultural Colonization: The British used the uni-
versity system as a tool for cultural influence.

Post-Colonial Shift: The Government of India Act of

1935 began the process of ‘Indianisation’ of educa-

tion, transferring more control to provincial govern-

ments and marking the end of British dominance over

the Indian education system.

Post-INDEPENDENCE DEVELOPMENT IN HIGHER
EDUCATION IN INDIA

1.

Continuity and Change: The shift in higher educa-
tion after independence continued from the pre-inde-
pendence era. Initially, higher education was primar-
ily for the elite, but post-independence goals aimed to
make it accessible to the wider Indian public.

: Expansion and Inclusion:

Numerous new universities were established to
expand educational opportunities.

* Diverse courses and professional studies were
introduced, leading to the establishment of pre-
mier institutions like IITs, BITS-Pilani, regional
engineering colleges, and IIMs.

e National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian
Institutes of Science (IISc), and Indian Institutes
of Science Education and Research (IISERs) were
developed.

Focus on Languages and Humanities: These fields

gained prominence up until the 1980s.

Further Growth in the 1990s and 2000s:

° This period saw the establishment of new IITs and
IIMs.

° Despite this expansion, the organizational struc-
ture of universities, largely based on the principle
of affiliation, remained largely unchanged.

Governance and Administrative Bodies:

° Most Indian universities maintained an affiliation
system, aiming for efficient governance of con-
stituent and affiliated colleges.

° Statutory bodies were established to govern these
institutions.

Types of Universities:

The Indian higher education system comprises
mainly two types of universities:

® Unitary universities: focus on teaching and
research within a single campus.

° Affiliating universities: They have a central cam-
pus for postgraduate instruction and research, with
several affiliated colleges spread across districts

FUNDING AND Types OF COLLEGES IN INDIAN
Hicguer Epucation System
1. University Funding:

Most Indian universities receive funding from
Central or State governments.

vate trusts, like Birla Institute of Technology ang
Science, Pilani, and Thapar University, Patiala,

° Private universities, set up under Acts of ©
Legislatures, include Sikkim- Manipal University
and Amity University in Chattisgarh.

2. Colleges and Their Types:

A significant portion of undergraduate teaching

occurs in colleges.

e Colleges are categorized as:

(i) Constituent Colleges: Established and man-
aged directly by the university.

(ii) Affiliated Colleges: Set up and managed
outside the university, often by the govern-
ment or educational trusts, with affiliation
granted by the universities in consultation
with the government.

3. Sources of University Funding: University income in

India comes from the following.
° Central Government grants.
° State Government grants.
® Student fees.
¢ Endowments.and donations.
¢ Support from specialized agencies.

4. Types of Grants:

e State government grants to universities are
divided into:

(i) Maintenance/Block Grants: For routine
operations, including salaries. They are
adjusted periodically based on cost changes.

(ii) Non-recurring Grants: Used for infra-
structural needs like buildings and equip-
ment. Land is usually provided by the State
government.

(iii) Development Grants: For new schemes,
often matched by the university for vari-
ous activities, especially those sponsored by
federal/state governments and channelled
through the UGC.

e Central government provides grants for general
and developmental purposes through the UGC.
When states become responsible for grants,
financial challenges may arise.

(SEAO) region.

The Rank of India: India is positioned 40th out of 132
Nations. That ranking was 81st in 2015. The improve-
ment in GII is attributed to its rich knowledge capital, a

lic and private research organizations. Our response
to Covid-19 pandemic and its commitment to the Atma
Nirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India) were innovative.

Science and Technology Clusters (S & T Clusters):
The most significant S&T clusters are Tokyo-Yokohama,
Shenzhen—Hong Kong~Guangzhou, Seoul, Beijing, and
Shanghai-Suzhou. The rank of China was 21st and USA
was 21, thus China surpassed USA.

India has only four S&T clusters in the top 100 (Chennai,
Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi), compared to China’s 24
and the USA’s 21.

Role of NITI Aayog: NITI is working to promote innova-
tion in key sectors like electric vehicles, biotechnology,
nanotechnology, space, and alternative energy sources.
