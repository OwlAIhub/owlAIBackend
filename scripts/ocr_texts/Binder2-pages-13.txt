Contrary: When two universal propositions differ
only in quality. By definition, both opposite propo-
sitions can be both false and true at the same time.
If one of them is true, the other must necessarily be
false. If one is false, the other may be true or false.
That is, if ‘E’ is true, then ‘A’ is true; ‘T’ is false

Sub-contraries: Contrasting propositions can be
true simultaneously, but they cannot be false at the
same time. If one of them is true, thé other may be
true or false, but if one of them is false, the other must
be true. That is, if ‘T’ is true, then ‘E’ is true; ‘O’ is true.

Sub - alternation: When two prepositions differ only
in quantity (one is universal and the other is special),
such an opposition is said to be sub — alternation.
These propositions may be simultaneously true or
simultaneously false. That is, if ‘O’ is true, then ‘E’ is
false; ‘T’ is true

Thus, if‘all men are mortal’ is true, then we can validly
infer that No men are mortal is false’(Contrary). Some
men are mortal is true (Sub — alteration) and ‘Some
men are not mortal’ (contradictory proposition).

(d) Information and Communication Technology (ICT)

Routers are networking devices. They are responsible
for receiving, analysing, and forwarding data pack-
ets among the connected computer networks. On the
arrival of a data packet, the router inspects the des-
tination address, consults its routing tables to decide
the optimal route and then transfers the packet along
this route.

A router can be used both in LANs (Local Area Net-
works) and WANs (Wide Area Networks). Routers are
more expensive than other networking devices like
hubs, bridges and switches. Routers are manufactured
by some popular companies such as Cisco, D-Link,
HP, Nortel etc.

A router is a layer 3. or network layer device in OSI
Model while data link layer works in the layer 2 of OSI
Model. Data link layer is responsible for maintaining
the data link between two hosts or nodes.

(d) Research Aptitude

Survey Research

Survey research a research method involving the use
of standardized questionnaires or interviews to collect
data about people and their preferences, thoughts,



=== Page 2 ===
and behaviors in a systematic manner. As surveys are
used to collect data from a predefined subject(s), they
have been counted under ‘positivism’ approach.

The survey as a formal research method was pio-
neered in the 1930-40s by sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld
to examine the effects of the radio on political opin-
ion formation of the United States. This method has
since become a very popular method for quantitative
research in the social sciences.

The survey method can be used for descriptive,
exploratory, or explanatory research.

Survey research has several inherent strengths com-
pared to other research methods due to following
reasons.

(i) Survey is an excellent vehicle to measure a wide
variety of data - people’s preferences (politi-
cal orientation), traits (self-esteem), attitudes
(toward immigrants), beliefs (about a new law),
behaviors (smoking), or factual information
(income).

(ii) It is ideally suited for remotely collecting data
about a population. For example, a large nation
such as India or its state UP, MP, Maharashtra
that can be covered using mail~in, electronic
mail, or telephone surveys. Researches can use
well planned sampling to ensure that the popula-
tion is adequately represented in a small sample.

(iii) Interviews may be the only way of reaching cer-
tain population groups such as the homeless or
illegal immigrants for which there is no sampling
frame available.

(iv) Survey research is economical in terms of
researcher time, effort and cost than most other
methods such as experimental research and case
research.

At the same time, survey research also has some
unique disadvantages. It is subject to a large number
of biases such as non-response bias, sampling bias,
social desirability bias, and recall bias, etc.

Depending on data collection techniques, survey

research can be divided into two broad categories:

Gi) Questionnaire surveys -— mail-in, group-admin-
istered, or online surveys), and

(ii) Interview surveys — personal, telephone, or
focus group interviews (These have been dis-
cussed in detail in second unit of Pearson title for
NTA-—NET exam).

Constructing a survey questionnaire (or interview-
ing) is an art. For the benefit of research students,
the following responses to structured questions have
been suggested.

(i) Dichotomous response — responses such as true/
false, yes/no, or agree/disagree. Is MSP required for
crops — Yes / No

(ii) Nominal response — more than two unordered
options. What is your industry of employment: manu-
facturing / supply chain / consumer services / retail /
education.

(iii) Ordinal response — more than two ordered
options. What is your highest level of education: high
school / college degree / graduate studies/ PG / PhD.

(iv) Interval-level response — When respondents
are presented with a 5-point or 7—point Likert scale,
semantic differential scale, or Guttman scale etc.

(v) Continuous response — When respondents enter
a continuous (ratio-scaled) value with a meaning-
ful zero point, such as their age or tenure in a firm.
These responses generally tend to be of the fill-in—the
blanks type.

The survey questions should be stated in a very sim-
ple language, preferably in active voice, and without
complicated words or jargon so that they are clearly
understandable by a typical respondent. Questions
must not be biased and too much detailed.

Double-barreled questions are those that can have
multiple answers. For example, are you satisfied with
the hardware and software provided for your work?

Question should not be presumptuous such as on
taxes — too high or too low. Avoid questions with
built-in presumptions.

‘Question sequencing’ should be proper, such as
questions should flow logically from one to the next.

Role of interviewer should be motivational for respon-
dents. They should make a good questionnaire.

Just pausing and waiting (without going into the
next question) may suggest to respondents that the
interviewer is waiting for more detailed response. It is
called as ‘silent probe’.

The interviewer can try the psychotherapist’s trick
of repeating what the respondent said is called as
‘Reflection’.

Five common biases in survey research are non—
response bias, sampling bias (excluding some peo-
ple who don’t have some resources such as mobile

- phone), social desirability bias (avoid negative opin-

ions), recall bias (subjects’ motivation, memory, and
ability to respond). Common method bias refers to
the amount of spurious covariance shared between
independent and dependent variables that are mea-
sured at the same point in time such as in a cross-
sectional survey, using the same instrument, such as
a questionnaire.

(c) People, Development and Environment
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

SDGs, also known as the Global Goals, were adopted
by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to
action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure
that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity.

The 17 SDGs are integrated—-they recognize that
action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and
that development must balance social, economic and
environmental sustainability.

GOAL 1: NO POVERTY

GOAL 2: ZERO HUNGER

GOAL 3: GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

GOAL 4: QUALITY EDUCATION

GOAL 5: GENDER EQUALITY

GOAL 6: CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION

GOAL 7: AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY

GOAL 8: DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH

GOAL 9: INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND

(d) Higher Education System

Global Citizenship Education: Topics and learning
objectives, should be counted as the first pedagogical
guidance from UNESCO on global citizenship educa-
tion. With such education, young people are able to
solve problems, make decisions, think critically, com-
municate ideas effectively and work well with others.
This not only helps them personally and education-
ally, but eventually professionally as well. Thus, a
global education in the classroom is paramount.

(b) Communication

‘The medium is the message’ is an expression coined
by Canadian educator Marshall McLuhan that is often
interpreted to mean that the “media” used to commu-
nicate information have a significant impact on the
messages they deliver. The form of a message (print,
visual, musical, etc.) determines the ways in which

21,

23.

that message will be perceived. Modern electronic
communications (including radio, television, films,
and computers) would have far-reaching sociologi-
cal, aesthetic, and philosophical consequences, to the
point of actually altering the ways in which we experi-
ence the world.

{c) Mathematical Reasoning and Aptitude

We can solve this question, by counting all the items
with the difference d (i.e 175 — 168 = 182-175)

Or by using the following formula of Arithmetic
Progression

a, = 266,a = 168 andd =7

Formula: a, = a + (n-1)d

266 = 168 + (n-1)7

n-1 = (266-168) /7 = 98/7 = 14
n=14+1=15

Thus, (c) is the correct answer.

- (c) Mathematical Reasoning and Aptitude

The highest denominator in options is 80. We will
make every fraction equal to 80.

11/16 x 5/5 = 55/80

29/40 x 2/2 = 58/80

5/8 = 5/8 x 10/10 = 50/80
65/80 — no change required.

Now every fraction has 80 as denominator, we need to
compare only numerators to compare.

Thus 5/8 is the smallest fraction.
(d) Research Aptitude

Non-parametric (and Parametric tests): First, we
need to look at some basic difference between para-
metric and non-parametric tests.

In parametric tests, the parameters are assumed and
the population distribution is always known. To cal-
culate the central tendency, a mean value is used.
In such tests, we assume normal distribution curve
(bell shaped curve). For example, if we were to mea-
sure the height of people (in a population), we take
some sample, we would see a typical bell-shaped
curve. This distribution is also called the Gaussian
distribution.

In statistics, nonparametric tests are methods of sta-
tistical analysis that do not require a distribution to
meet the required assumptions to be analyzed (espe-
cially if the data is not normally distributed). Due
to this reason, they are sometimes referred to as
distribution-free tests.

Parametric tests are generally more powerful than the

non-parametric tests, where smaller sample sizes are
required in parametric tests.

(b) Logical Reasoning

Exclusive premise: The fallacy of exclusive premises
is a syllogistic fallacy committed in a categorical syl-
logism that is invalid because both of its premises are
negative.

Illicit major: Illicit major is a formal fallacy commit-
ted in a categorical syllogism that is invalid because
its major term is undistributed in the major premise
but distributed in the conclusion.

O’ type
_ Particular
negative) ee
Etype (Universal Both subject
negative) and predicate

_ Only predicate

Therefore, no dogs
are birds.
Thus, in premises 1 some birds (major term / subject)
are undistributed. In the conclusion dogs (subject)
and the birds (predicate) both are distributed.

Undistributed middle: The fallacy of the undistrib-
uted middle is a formal fallacy that is committed
when the middle term in a categorical syllogism is not
distributed in either the minor premise or the major
premise. It is thus a syllogistic fallacy.

Illicit minor: the fallacy of illicit minor term is undis-
tributed in the premise but is distributed in the con-
clusion (but not vice — versa).

(a) Communication

Diagonal communication: The communication
among the persons at different levels who have no
direct relationship is called diagonal relationship.
This communication is effective as hierarchical bind-
ings are removed and there is a free flow of informa-
tion, cutting across different positions.

Horizontal communication: communication with
people at the same level in a hierarchy of peers and
colleagues is termed as horizontal communication.

This may combine both formal and informal
communication.

Intrapersonal communication: it is a communica-
tion within an individual almost all the times, such as
talking to oneself, listening to oneself and relating to
oneself. It includes individual reflection, meditation,
contemplation and praying to God.

Upward communication: This communication is the
process of information flowing from the lower levels
of a hierarchy to the upper levels. It is the process by
which lower-level company employees can directly
communicate with upper management to provide
feedback, complaints or suggestions regarding the
day-to-day operations of the company.

(a, b, d) People, Development and Environment

Cerebrum: Cerebrum, the largest and uppermost
portion of the brain. The cerebrum consists of the
cerebral hemispheres and accounts for two-thirds of
the total weight of the brain.

Hippocampus: It is a small, curved formation in the
brain that plays an important role in the limbic sys-
tem. It is involved in the formation of new memories
and is also associated with learning and emotions.

Pons: It is a portion of the hindbrain that connects the
cerebral cortex with the medulla oblongata. It also
serves as a communications and coordination centre
between the two hemispheres of the brain.

Thalamus: The thalamus functions as a -relay
station in which sensory pathways of the spinal cord
and brainstem form synapses on their way to the cere-
bral cortex. Specific locations in the thalamus are
related to specific areas on the body surface and in the
cerebral cortex.

(b) Higher Education System

Indian Institute of Advance Study (IIAS): This
research institute is based in Shimla. It was set up by
the Ministry of Education in 1964 and it started func-
tioning in 1965.

Indian Biological Science and Research Institute
CIBRI): It is located in Noida, UP. IBRI is run by the
academicians from different technological fields
such as Pharmaceutics, Biotechnology, Bioinformat-
ics, Information Technology and Mathematics. The
mandate of IBRI is to undertake research and training
from basics to industrial level in biosciences domains.

Indian Institute of Soil Science (IISS): This institute
is linked with ICAR (Indian Council of Agriculture
Research). ICAR-IISS was established in 1988 at
Bhopal with a mandate of “Enhancing Soil Productiv-
ity with Minimum Environmental Degradation”. IISS
has emerged as a leader in basic and strategic research
on soils in the country.

Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research (IISR):
IISR was established in Lucknow in 1952. It deals with
basic issues linked with sugarcane. In 1954, its work-
ing was taken care of by Government, then in 1969, it
was transferred to ICAR, New Delhi alongwith other
central agricultural research institutes.

(d) Mathematical Reasoning and Aptitude

Let number of 20 paise coins = X

Then number of 25 paise coins = 324-—X

Total value = X (20/100) + (324 -X) 25/100 ==71
X/5 + (324-X)/4=2%71

X = 200

Thus, the number of 20 paise coins is 200.

(c) Higher Education system

This question is linked with good governance, so
linked with public. Data (statistics) and ICT are also
going to be part of it. There seems to be some aberra-
tion in statement II.

(d) Information and Communication Technology
This is a direct question of matching.

(b) Communication ,

Technological barrier: low bandwidth of internet is
example of technological barrier.

Psychological barrier: Complexity of ideas and per-
sonal attitude towards technology is an example psy-
chological barrier.

Geographical barriers: physical locations of com-
municators is a geographical barrier.

Semantic barrier: communication barriers related to
language and the meaning of the words.

(a) Mathematical Reasoning and Aptitude
Statement I

Amount = 280 (1+10/100)(1+5/100)

= 280(11/10) (21/20) = ¥ 323.4

Compound Interest = Amount ~ Principal

= 323.4-280 = % 43.4

The given answer is % 44.3.

Statement II

This question is based on simple interest, so interest
will be ¥ 5.6 on = 100 every annum. In 15 years, total
SI will be 15 x 5.6 = % 84. Thus, amount will not be
doubled, but much less than that.

Thus, both statements are not correct.

(d) Information and Communication Technology

In computing, the Post Office Protocol is an applica-
tion—layer Internet standard protocol used by e-mail
clients to retrieve e-mail from a mail server, POP ver-
sion 3 is the version in common use.

34,

35.

The Post Office Protocol provides access via an Inter-
net Protocol (IP) network for a user client application
to a mailbox (maildrop) maintained on a mail server.
Thus, the protocol used when receiving emails from
the email server.

(a) Higher Education System

CBCS stands for the choice~based credit system.
CBCS grading systems surpass the “conventional per-
centage’ and grading means to evaluate a student’s
academic skills. CBCS follows a more standardised
way of assessment and examination management.
CBCS software grading system is uniform across all
educational institutes. It follows the semester pattern
and not the annual examination pattern.

UGC also follows a 10-point grading system, with 0
being absent/fail and 10 being outstanding.

File Transfer Protocol (FTP): FTP is a standard com-
munication protocol used for the transfer of computer
files from a server to a client on a computer network.
FTP is built on a client-server model architecture
using separate control and data connections between
the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate
themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, nor-
mally in the form of a username and password. FTP
is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced
with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) for secure
transmission.

(a) People, Development and Environment

According to Urie Bronfenbrenner’s biological model
of human development, microsystem constitutes
immediate family, schools:and neighbourhood.

(a) People, Development and Environment

Statement I: small amount of atmospheric Nitrogen
dioxide is produced from polluting sources.

NO, is an intermediate in the industrial synthesis of
nitric acid. It is largely used in the production of fer-
tilisers also. At higher temperatures it is a reddish—
brown gas. It can be fatal if inhaled in large quantity.

Statement II: Most of the atmospheric NO, is
produced due to photochemical reactions in the
atmosphere.

Nitrogen dioxide, NO,, present in air is known to be
photochemically active due to the presence of an
unpaired electron. NO, molecule reaches a higher
level of energy when it absorbs a photon of light with
energy, which converts the ground state molecule to
electronically excited state molecule. NO,, Ozone and
PAN show photochemical reactions and photochemi-
cal smog is formed.

39.(b) Mathematical Reasoning and Aptitude

40.

If each averaged number, X, is multiplied by an
another number, Y, then new average will be multipli-
cation of those numbers, that is X.Y. Thus, answer to
this question will be 7x11 = 77.

(b) People, Development and Environment

Diarrhoea is a type of waterborne disease which is
caused by virus, bacteria and protozoa. The main
symptoms. of diarrhea are frequent loose, watery
stools and a pressing urge to have a bowel movement.
The most common causes of acute and persistent
diarrhea are infections, travelers’ diarrhea, and side
effects of medicines. Many viruses cause diarrhea,

‘ including norovirus link and rotavirus link. Viral gas-

41.

troenteritis is a common cause of acute diarrhea.
(c) Teaching Aptitude
According to Piaget, the ability to solve conservation

42.

43.

problems depends on having an understanding of
three basic aspects of reasoning: identity, compensa-
tion and reversibility.

Jean Piaget mentioned the following stages for cogni-
tive development: :

(i) Sensory Period (0-2 years)

(ii) Pre —- operational period (2-7 years)

(iii) Concrete operational period (7 —-11 years)

(iv) Formal operation period (11-15 years)

The stage of classification depends on students’ abil-
ity to focus on a single characteristic of objects in a set
and group of objects according to that characteristic.
Thus, statement II is incorrect.

(b) Research Aptitude

Descriptive Hypothesis: This contains only one
variable so it is called a univariate hypothesis. This
typically states the existence, size, form or distribu-
tion of some variable. It describes the situation or col-
lects the data, the same as it has happened without
adding our own assumptions as a researcher.

Null Hypothesis: the null hypothesis (often denoted
Ho) is that two possibilities are the same. The null
hypothesis is that the observed difference is due to
chance alone. Using statistical tests, it is possible to cal-
culate the likelihood that the null hypothesis is true.
Explanatory Hypothesis: This hypothesis guides the
cause and effect relationship between two variables.
For example, when salaries increase, then spending
on food items also increase.

Intervening and confounding variables add to the
impact of independent variables on dependent
variables.

(c) Logical Reasoning

The denotative meaning of a word is simply the
commonly accepted meaning or the definition that
you would find if you were to look up that word in a
dictionary.

Typically, the connotative meaning of a word has
more of an emotional association and is more likely
to trigger an emotional response than the denotative
meaning.

Truth and falsehood are predicates of a statement and
validity and invalidity are predicates of an argument.
