Data Interpretation Le
Data interpretation is one of the easiest chapters of NET
Paper 1. It is basically about drawing conclusions and
inferences from comprehensive data presented numeri-
cally in a tabular or graphical form by means of an illus-
tration, such as graphs, pie charts and so on. Therefore,
the act of organizing and interpreting data to get mean-
ingful information is known as data interpretation. The
important aspects of data sources, their acquisition and
interpretation have been covered in Unit II on research
aptitude. In this unit, the main focus is on solving practi-
cal problems as per questions asked in the NET pattern.

Data interpretation needs some mathematical and sta-
tistical skills. It needs good knowledge of the concepts of
percentage, ratio, proportion, average, etc. The other main
input required is to practice a few problems.

Familiarity with graphical representation of data, such
as Venn diagrams, graphs, pie charts, histogram and poly-
gon, is helpful. Once the data is grasped well, questions
based on tables and graphs take little time.

Sometimes, data is presented in more than one table
or graph. The aim is to test not only the quantitative skills
but also relative, comparative and analytical abilities.

While the terms ‘data’ and ‘statistics’ are often used
interchangeably, in scholarly research there. is an impor-
tant distinction between the two.

Data refers to individual pieces of factual information
recorded and used for the purpose of analysis. It is the raw
information from which statistics are created. Statistics
are the results of data analysis through its interpretation
and presentation.

Data is usually collected for research purposes, and
it is closely related with sampling as well. Data sources,
acquisition and classification have been taken care of in
the second unit of research. Acquisition basically means
collecting data and how it is collected with the help of
interviews, questionnaire and so on. Primary and sec-
ondary sources, quantitative and qualitative data have
also been explained there.

raphical Representation

Basically, it is a graphic representation of data. It is one of
the important ways of analysing numerical data. A graph
is a kind of chart through which statistical data is repre-
sented in the form of lines or curves drawn across coor-
dinated points that are plotted on its surface. Graphs are
also easy to understand and are eye catching.

They help us to study the cause and effect relationship
between two variables, to measure the extent of change in
one variable when another variable changes by a certain
amount.

They enable us to study both the time series and the
frequency distribution. They give clear account and pre-
cise picture of a problem.

GENERAL PrincipLes oF GRAPHIC

REPRESENTATION

Some basic algebraic principles apply to all types
graphic representation of data:

1. There are two lines called coordinate axes, where the
vertical one is known as Y-axis and the horizontal One
is called X-axis (Fig. 7.1). :

2. These two lines are perpendicular to each other
Where these two lines intersect each other is calleq
point ‘O’ or origin.

3. On the X-axis, the distances right of the origin have
positive values and the distances left of the origin
have negative values. On the Y-axis, distances above
the origin have positive values and those below the
origin have negative values.

Graphical representation of data may have many for-
mats. According to the NTA-NET syllabus, graphic repre-
sentation of data has been divided into bar chart, histo-
grams, pie chart, table chart and line chart. Here, we are
discussing their brief description and some numerical
problems.

Bar CHart

It is also known as a column graph, a bar graph or a
bar diagram. It is basically a pictorial representation of
data and is shown as rectangles spaced out with equal
spaces between them and having equal width. Here,
the height (or length) of each bar corresponds to the
frequency of a particular observation. We can draw bar
graphs both vertically and horizontally depending on
whether we take the frequency along the vertical or
horizontal axes, respectively. We can take the following
example.

Bar charts are one of the easiest, graphically attractive
and, hence, most commonly used methods of presenting
all types of data. Given quantities can be compared by
the height or length of a bar graph. A bar graph can have

per vertical or horizontal bars. The width of the bars is
gely inessential and is used only for clarity of presen-
jon. We can compare different quantities or the same
uantity at different times.
In bar graphs, the data is discrete. Presentation

s we could see, the bar chart graph depicts discrete
ata, while histograms depict continuous data. The con-
inuous data can take the shape of class intervals. Thus,
histogram is a graphical representation with class
ntervals or attributes as the base and frequency as the
eight (Fig. 7.3).

Histograms have bars without any spaces between
hem and the rectangles need not be of equal width. It can
e understood with the following example.

Class intervals such as 0-5, 5-10, 10-15 and 15--20 are
ontinuous data. We may ignore the values on the right
ertical axis. Thus, for the class interval 0-5, the cor-
esponding frequency is 3. Again, for the class interval
~10, the frequency is 7 and so on.

tion of the data can be determined by a histogram. In
addition, it can show any outliers or gaps in the data.

DISTRIBUTIONS OF A HISTOGRAM

1. A Normal Distribution: Here, points on one side of
the average are as likely to occur as on the other side
of the average (Fig. 7.4).

a

2. A Bimodal Distribution: In bimodal distribution, the
data should be separated and analysed as separate
normal distributions (Fig. 7.5).

3. A Right-skewed Distribution: A right-skewed distri-
bution is also called a positively skewed distribution.
In a right-skewed distribution, a larger number of
data values occur on the left side and a fewer number
of data values on the right side (Fig. 7.6).

4. Aleft-skewed distribution: A left-skewed distribution
is also called a negatively skewed distribution. A larger
number of data values occur on the right side and a
fewer number of data values on the left side (Fig. 7.7).

Figure 7.7 Left-Skewed Distribution

5. Arandom distribution: A random distribution lacks an
apparent pattern and has several peaks. Here, the dif-
ferent data properties are combined. Therefore, the data
should be separated and analysed separately (Fig. 7.8).

ple is a systematic arrangement of data into vertical
ans and horizontal rows. The process of arranging
into rows and columns is called tabulation.

pOSsE

| purpose of tabulation is to present data in such a way
jt becomes more meaningful and can be easily under-
d bya common person. However, in case of voluminous
a, it may require closer reading than graphs of charts
hence, it is difficult and time consuming to interpret.

ENTIAL PARTS OF A TABLE
atistical table is divided into the following eight parts:

Title of the table: A title is a heading at the top of the
table describing its contents. It mainly reflects upon
the nature of the data, where the data is, what time
period the data covers and how the data is classified.
Caption: The headings for various columns and
rows are called column captions and row captions,
respectively.

irections: The following table shows the monthly
come and various expenditures, of six friends A-F in
solute value or in percentage (in terms of monthly

. Incentive Amounts to 15% of salary.

. All six friends save 40% of their monthly income.

A. There is no expenditure other than those given in the table.
Solution:
An Important Note: We need to quick look at ques-
tions first and see what kind of data may be required.
Accordingly, we are starting with friends A — F. This
question needs to have lots of calculations. We are put-
ting all the information in the table directly. We need to
Create special columns for savings and expenditures for
the given MCQs.

3. Box head: The portion of the table containing the col-
umn caption is called the box head.

4. Stub: The portion of the table containing row caption
is called stub.

5. Body of the table: The body of the table contains the
statistical data that has to be presented in different
rows and columns. :

6. Prefatory notes or head notes: Prefatory notes
appear between the title and the body of the table and
are enclosed in brackets. They may throw some light
on the units of measurements.

7. Footnote: A footnote is always given at the bottom of
the table but above the source note. It is a statement
about something which is not clear from the headings,
title, stubs, captions and so on.

8. Source note: A source note is placed immediately
below the table but after the footnote. It refers to the
source from where information has been taken.

income) form. Some values (marked as ‘’) are missing in
the table which you are expected to calculate if required.
Based on the data in the table, answer the question:

Thus, Monthly Income (MI) = 92000 + 13800 = ¥105800
Accommodation = 10% of MI = 10% of 105800 =%10580
Shopping = 15% of 10580 = €15870

Friend B = Incentives = 15% of Salary

Salary = Incentives / 15 «© 100 = 14400 / 15 «© 100
%96000

Monthly Income = 96000 + 14400 = 7110400
Expenditure = 60% of 110400 = 66240; Savings
%110400 — 66240 = 744160

Friend C: Monthly Income = 84000 + 12600 = %96600
Expenditure = 60% of ¥96600, Savings =

engine cars in State ‘D’
(a) 24 (b) 42
(c) 56 (d) 68
Ans: 1.Total number of cars in State B = 28% of 1400
= 392
The Number of Diesel cars in State B = 5/(9+-5)
co 392 = 140
Total Number of cars in State D = 26% of 1400
= 364
(This can be calculated by taking a difference of
2% between B and D, that means 392 ~ 2%
of 1400 = 364)
Number of Petrol cars in State D = Half of 364
= 182
Thus, the difference = 182~140 = 42. (b) is the
correct answer. .O
12. Number of petrol engine cars in State ‘C’ is what per-

cent more than the number of diesel engine cars in

State ‘A’:?

(a) 100% (b) 125%

(c) 200% (d) 120%

Ans: Total cars in State C = 32% of 1400 = 448
No. of Petrol cars in State C = 3/8 0 448 = 168
Total No. of Cars in State A = 14% of 1400 = 196
No. of Diesel cars in State A = 3 / (8+4) 0 196

= 3028 = 84
As comparison is with State A, that is to be taken
as a base.

Thus, required %age = No. of Petrol cars in
State C / No. of Diesel cars in State Ao 100

= 168 / 84 0 100 = 200%. Thus, (c) is the cor-
rect answer.

tioned (AC), then what is the number of diesel engine
cars which are non-AC in State ‘C’?

(a) 150 (b) 90
(c) 190 (d) 210
Ans: From above MCQ, No. of diesel cars in State C =
448 ~ 168 = 280
Thus, No. of non-AC Diesel cars = (100 — 25)%
of 280 = 75% of 280 = 210. (d) is the cor-
rect answer.

14. What is the difference between the total number of

cars in State ‘C’ and the number of petrol engine cars

in State ‘B’?
(a) 212 (b) 224
(c) 204 (d) 196

Ans: Total No. of Cars in State C = 448
Total No. of Petrol cars in State B = 392 — 140

What is the total number of items of type C produced
in the year 2020 and 2021 together?

(a) 12482 (b) 13262

(c) 14786 (d) 15200

Ans: The No. of items of C type produced in 2020 and
2021 = 17% of 48600 + 8% of 62500

= 8262 + 5000 = 13262

Thus, (b) is the correct answer.

2. The number of items-.of type B produced in 2020 is
approximately ___ % of the number of items of type B
produced in 2021.

(a) 84 (b) 87

{c) 90 (d) 93

Ans: Number of type B items produced in 2020 =
18% of 48600 = 8748

316.

741

Number of type B items produced in 2021 =
15% of 62500 = 9375

As comparison is with 2021, that will be taken
as base.

8748
9375

= approx 93%. (d) is the correct answer.

Thus, desired answer = oo 100 = 93.31

33. What is.the ratio of the number of items of type D pro-
duced in 2020 to the number of items of type F pro-
duced in 2021?

972 : 1500
324: 500
81: 125

Thus, (c) is the correct answer.

34. What is the total number of items of type A, B and C
produced by the company in 2020 and 2021 together?

(a) 50897 (b) 51164

(c) 52324 (d) 48542

Ans: Total Number of items by Company A, B and C
in 2020
= (17 + 18 + 17)% of 48600 + (18+ 15 + 8)%
of 62500

= 52% of 48600 + 41% of 62500 = 25272 +
25625 = 50897

Thus, (a) is the correct answer.

35. The number of items of type E produced in the year .
2021 is___% more than the number of items of type
C produced in 2021.

(a) 105 (b) 75

(c) 60 (d) 125

Ans: Note that we don’t need to do calculation with
62500, that is total of production of 2021.

The total is to assumed to be 100, and calcula-
tions to be done accordingly.

As they belong to the same year 2021, the %age
difference between E and C = 18-8 = 10

No. of items of type C in 2021 = 8

As the comparison is with C, that will be taken
as the base.

Thus, required answer = 10 ~ 100 = 125%.
(d) is the correct answer.

Cincte Grarns (on Pie Cuarts)

Circle graphs are used to show how various sectors are in the
whole. They are popularly called pie charts. Circle graphs
usually give the percentage that each sector receives.

In such representation, the total quantity in question
is distributed over a total angle of 360°. While using pie
chart to find the ratios of various sectors, there is no need
to find the amounts each sector received and then the
ratio of the amounts. Find the ratio of the percentages,
which is much easier.

If some percentage figure is to be converted into degrees
of angles extended at the centre, then multiply it by 3.6. For
example, if some category is 20%, in degrees equivalent, it
is 72°, that is, (20 x 3.6). Conversely, if degree data is to be
converted into per cent figure, then divide it by 3.6.

(a) 22,950 (b) 45,000

(c) 745,900 (d) %48,900

Ans: (c) The ratio between printing cost and royalty
= 20:15 0r4:3.
Let royalty be denoted by R.
Then 4: 3=61,200:R
Rx4= 61,200 x 3
R= (61,200 x 3)/4 = 245,900

72,. If the cost price of the book is 7150, then what is the

combined printing and binding cost for a single copy
of the book?

(a) 60 (b) 75

(c) 80 (d) *72

Ans: (a) Total printing and binding cost = 20 + 20
= 40%

Printing and binding cost = 40% of cost price
= 40% of 150 =%60

73. What is the central angle of the sector corresponding
to the expenditure incurred on royalty?
(a) 48° (b) 54°
(c) 60° (d) 72°



=== Page 18 ===
7.18

Ans: (b) Central angle corresponding to royalty
= (15% of 360)° = 15/100 x 360 = 54°

74, What is the difference between promotion and
printing cost if we assume that total cost is 200?

(a) §10 (b) ¥20

(c) ¥30 (d) 24

Ans: (b) Difference in percentage terms = 20-10
= 10%

Then, 10% of 200 = €20

75. If 1000 copies are published and the transportation
cost on them amounts to $15,000, then what should
be the selling price per book so that the publisher can

earn a profit of 20%?
(a) $150 (b) €160
(c) 7180 (d) ¥200

Ans: (c) To calculate the selling price of a single
book, we need to total the cost. Let us calculate
that first.

Transportation cost per book = 15,000/1000
=%15

As transportation cost is 10% of total cost, thus
%15 = 10% of total cost

Total cost of printing a copy = 15 x 100/10
=%150

Now selling price = total cost + profit
= 150 + 20% of 150 = 150+ 30 =%180

[J Data Mapping - |

’ Data mapping is the process of mapping data fields from a
source file to their related target fields. The accessibility to
required data can make some organization more success-
ful. Somehow, data is easier to use when it is visualized.

Visual data helps people understand how different con-
cepts originate and their relation with each other. Data
mapping helps in all these. For example, ‘Name’, ‘Email’
and ‘Phone’ fields from an Excel source are mapped to the
relevant fields in a delimited file, which is our destination.

Data mapping helps by providing organizations with
procedure links to show how certain tasks are to be uti-
lized. Forty per cent of our nerve fibres that are linked
to the brain are in the retina. Data mapping helps us see
what makes different pieces of data useful and helpful.

Customer trends can be traced in the real time. The
causes of trends and past data numbers can be analysed
and other calculations of information and variables can
be done. We can also use data mapping software to com-
pare our date with that of competitors. This should make
it easier for your business to grow when chosen right.

It also works by establishing larger maps. Sales-force of
any organization has a particularly strong data mapping
software program that can be put to use. This helps in real
time also. We can get connected to a cloud network to get
information in real time. ,

Data mapping works for all businesses. For example
if we were in the retail sector, then we can use data man
ping to calculate how discount sales can influence the
overall sales totals in a business. Similarly, financing and
investment decisions can also be made. :

Data may be internal or external, but if it is Settin,
more dispersed and voluminous, then data leverage is
important and actionable insights should be developed.

There are arrays of data points to collect information.
Their language may be quite different. We can develop
separate data models.

Data mapping tasks vary in complexity, depending op
the hierarchy or disparity between the structure of the
source and of the target. Every application, on-premise or
on cloud basis, uses metadata to explain data fields.

Microsoft SharePoint, InetSoft Style Intelligence
and IBM Cognos Business Intelligence help us to review
information by generating simple charts and graphs.
Depending on the number and schema of the data
sources, database mappings can have a varying degree of
complexity.

In general, data mapping helps with the following
activities.

Data INTEGRATION

It includes data mapping tools to cover differences in the
schemas of data source and destination, allowing busi-
nesses to consolidate information from different data
points easily.

Data Migration
It is moving data from one database to another. Here,

using a code-free data mapping solution that can auto.

mate the process is important to migrate data to the des-
tination successfully.

Data WaREHOUSING

Data mapping in a data warehouse is the process of creat-
ing a connection between the source and the target tables
or attributes,

Data TRANSFORMATION

It is essential to break information silos and draw insights.
Data mapping is the first step in data transformation.

Data Mappinc Techniques

Although an essential step in any data management pro-
cess, data mapping can be complex and time-consuming.
Based on the level of automation, data mapping tech-
niques can be divided into two types: '

1, Manual Data Mapping: Although hand-coded, man-
_ ual data mapping process offers unlimited flexibility.
2. Semi-automated Data Mapping: Schema mapping

is often classified as a semi-automated data mapping

technique. The process involves identifying two data -

objects that are semantically related and then build-
ing mappings between them.

jnterpretation of data assigns a meaning to the infor-
tion analysed and determines its signification and
cations. It refers to the implementation of processes
ough which data is reviewed for the purpose of arriv-
at an informed conclusion.
feeping in view its importance, data mapping should
done properly. Data is obtained from multiple sources,
t needs to enter the analysis process with haphazard
ering. Data analysis is usually subjective and, thus,
goals of interpretation may vary from one business to
ther. Basically, there are two main types of analysis,
ntitative and qualitative.
good decision should be made regarding scales of
asurement. The varying scales include the following:

Nominal scale: It consists of non-numeric categories
that cannot be ranked or compared quantitatively.
variables are exclusive and exhaustive.

Ordinal scale: It consists of categories that are exclu-
sive and exhaustive but with a logical order. Quality
ratings and agreement ratings are examples of ordi-
nal scales (i.e. good, very good, fair, etc., or agree,
strongly agree, disagree, etc.).

¢ Interval: It is a measurement scale where data is
grouped into categories with orderly and equal dis-
tances between the categories. There is always an
arbitrary zero point.

* Ratio: It contains features of all three mentioned
above.

hen interpreting data, an analyst must try to discern
e differences between correlation, causation and coin-
dences, etc., in addition to some other factors: In this
it, we will look at the two main methods of inter-
etation of data with a qualitative and a quantitative
alysis.

UALITATIVE DaTA INTERPRETATION

arrative data is mostly collected by employing a wide
riety of person-to-person techniques. It is basically
described as ‘categorical’. The description is not through
numerical values or patterns but through descriptive
mtext or text. These techniques include the following
rameters:

* Observations: Here, behaviour patterns may be the
amount of type and time spent in an activity and com-
munication used.

Documents: Here, different types of documentation
resources can be coded and divided based on the type
of material they contain.

Interviews: They are described as the best collection
method for narrative data. Enquiry responses can
be grouped by theme, topic or category. The inter-
view approach helps in highly focused data segmen-
tation.

A person to person data collection technique can lead to

build- tO Perso) , ; :
hree basic principles, notice things, collect things and

7.19

think about things. Qualitative data much open to inter-
pretation must be ‘coded’ so as to facilitate the grouping
and labelling of data into identifiable themes.

Quantitative Data INTERPRETATION

The keyword in quantitative is ‘numerical’. It is a set of pro-
cesses by which numerical data is analysed. It involves the
use of statistical modelling, such as standard deviation,
mean and median. Let’s quickly review the most common
statistical terms that are as follows:

* Mean: A mean represents a numerical average for a
set of responses.

® Standard Deviation: It reveals the distribution of
the responses around the mean, the degree of con-
sistency within the responses and then insight into
data sets.

* Frequency Distribution: This is a measurement of
gauging the rate of a response appearance within
a data set. It is extremely keen.in determining the
degree of consensus among data points.

It entails correlation tests between two or more variables.
The different processes can be used together or sepa-
rately, and comparisons can be made to ultimately arrive
at a conclusion. Other signature interpretation processes
of quantitative data include the following:

° Regression analysis
* Cohort analysis
° Predictive and prescriptive analysis

imPORTANCE OF Data INTERPRETATION

The purpose of collection and interpretation is to acquire
useful and usable information and to make the most
informed decisions possible. Data interpretation includes
the following characteristics:

®° Data identification and explanation
° Comparing and contrasting of data
° Identification of data outliers

° Future predictions

There are some common issues with data interpretation:

1. Informed Decision Making: Data analysis should
include identification, thesis development and data
collection followed by data communication.

2. Anticipating needs with Trends Identification:

Data insights provide knowledge, and knowledge is

power.

Cost Efficiency: Proper implementation of data anal-

ysis processes can provide businesses with profound

cost advantages within their industries.

4. Clear Foresight: Companies that collect and analyse
their data gain better knowledge about themselves,
their processes and performance.

od

In addition, there are certain problems with data inter-
pretation.



=== Page 20 ===
7.20

It is usually said that ‘big data equals big trouble’ where
some ‘pitfalls’ do exist and can occur when analysing data,
especially at the speed of thought. Let’s identify three of the
most common data misinterpretation risks and shed some
light on how they can be avoided:

1. Correlation mistaken for causation: It is the
tendency of data analysts to mix the cause of a
phenomenon with its correlation. When two actions
occurred together, one caused the other. This is not
accurate as actions can occur together. The remedy is
to attempt to eliminate the variable you believe to be
causing the phenomenon.

2. Confirmation Bias: It occurs when we havea theory
or hypothesis in mind, but are intent on discover-
ing only data patterns that provide support, while
rejecting those that do not. This pitfall is often
based on subjective desires. Thus, always remem-
ber to try to disprove a hypothesis rather than try to
prove it.

3. Irrelevant Data: As large data is no longer centrally
stored and as it continues to be analysed at the
speed of thought, it is inevitable that analysts will
focus on data that is irrelevant to the problem they
are trying to correct. The remedy is to proactively
and clearly frame any data analysis variables and
key performance indicators prior to engaging in a
data review.

Keeping in view all these aspects, we need to be careful
about the following factors:

1. Collect your data and make it as clean as possible.

2. We need to be careful about the type of analysis to
perform, be it qualitative or quantitative, and apply
the methods, respectively, to each. We have already
discussed qualitative and quantitative aspects.

3. We may need to take a step back and think about data
from various perspectives and what it means for vari-
ous participants or actors of the project.

4. Weneed to reflect on our own thinking and reasoning,
such as correlation versus causation, subjective bias,
false information and inaccurate data.

Data governance is a requirement in today’s fast-moving
and highly competitive enterprise environment. Now that
organizations have the opportunity to capture massive
amounts of diverse internal and external data, they need
a discipline to maximize their value, manage risks and
reduce costs. >

Data governance is a collection of processes, roles,
policies, standards and metrics that ensures the effective
and efficient use of information in enabling an organiza-
tion to achieve its goals. It defines who can take what
action, on what data, in what situations and using what
methods.

Data governance ensures that roles related to data are
clearly defined, and that responsibility and accountability °

are agreed upon across the enterprise. A well-planne
data governance framework covers strategic, tactica] and
operational roles and responsibilities. :

nclusivity with Antyodaya: To ensure all individu-
als benefit from growth, initiatives like ‘Antyodaya’,

enabled by ICT, aim to connect even the most remote
or marginalized people.

National Digital University: Announced in the 2023
pudget, this initiative will promote digital education,

showcasing the importance of ICT in making educa-
‘tion accessible, equitable, and high-quality.

Role of Al and Machine Learning: These technolo-
gies are increasingly important in education and
industry, offering personalized learning, real-time
feedback, and solutions for learning gaps.

India’s ICT Talent: Indian professionals are sig-
nificant in global ICT sectors, including holding key
roles at NASA and multinational corporations. The
appointment of Sundar Pichai as CEO of Alphabet Inc.
and Google is a notable example.

Learning from Global Partners: As Ex-President
Donald Trump suggested, there’s a mutual learning
opportunity between India and the USA, with India
focusing on STEM (science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics) and the USA on innovation and
entrepreneurship. In fact, every President of USA and
other powers appreciated and envisioned a role for
India in ICT sector.

8. There is great potential for affordable and scalable
learning solutions. NMEICT has embraced emerg-
ing trends in education technology, including artifi-
cial intelligence (AD, blended learning, open educa-
tional resources (OER), and digital assessment. These
trends reflect its commitment to staying at the fore-
front of technological advancements in education. We

Primary Ossectives in ICT Epucation

India aligns with the following three primary objectives
as per our framework:

1. ICT Education: This entails preparing a skilled work-
force to meet the IT needs of our knowledge-driven
society, encompassing both software and hardware.

2. ICT-supported Education: Often referred to as
multimedia education, this approach is adopted by
numerous distance education institutions, comple-
menting printed study materials with ICT tools such
as radio and TV programs, audio and video record-
ings, and multimedia content distributed via:‘CDs.

ICT-enabled Education: In this scenario, an all-

encompassing educational program is delivered

exclusively through ICT platforms.

ed

Opsectives oF InteGration ICT in HicHer Epucation
These include the following:

1. Enhancing access through online education.

2. Elevating the quality of teaching, particularly in
remote areas.

3. Enhancing transparency and strengthening educa-
tional systems, processes, and compliance standards.

4. Measuring student learning participation and
effectiveness.

5. Analyzing student behaviour to optimize engage-
ment, improve retention, and enhance employability.

6. Evaluating student performance, placement, applica-
tion volume, website analytics, and social media met-
rics for institutional branding.

STRENGTHS AND Limitations oF ICT in EpucaTion
Sector

There is demographic dividend available to India, there
will be 100 crores graduates in coming 25 years. ICT
offers various advantages, including:

1. Personalized Learning: ICT enables customized
education to cater to individual learning preferences
and pacing.

2. Interactivity: Learners can engage more effectively
with content through interactivity, enabling them to
navigate content flexibly based on prior knowledge
and experience.

3. Insensitivity to Distance and Climate: ICT allows
education to transcend geographical and climatic
constraints.

4. Cost-effectiveness, Rapid Delivery, and Wider Reach:
As the number of learners increases, ICT becomes
more economical, offers higher delivery speeds, and
reaches a broader audience.

5. Diverse Teaching Functions and Audiences: ICT,
particularly computer- and internet-based technolo-
gies, are valuable for drills, practice, and accessing
information on various related themes.



=== Page 24 ===
8.4

6. Uniform Quality: ICT ensures the same quality of
education is accessible to all segments of society at a
low cost, promoting equality in education.

LIMITATIONS OF ICT

1. High Infrastructure and Start-up Costs: Building and
maintaining ICT systems, including hardware and soft-
ware, can be costly. That requires lots of skills, but this
may come downas there is laot of competition in the mar-
ket now to provide updated technologies at a lower price.

2. To deal with Individual Differences for Economies
of Scale: To reduce costs, identical content may be
delivered to all learners, potentially overlooking the
diverse learning needs of individuals and creating a
digital divide.
Accessibility Challenges: Factors such as timing,
electricity supply, socio-cultural aspects, poverty, illit-
eracy, time constraints, mobility, and relevance can
impede accessibility.
4. ICT Primarily as a Delivery System: ICT serves as a
content delivery tool rather than initiating significant
attitudinal or behavioural changes.

5. Difficulty in Performance Evaluation: Assessing
performance takes time due to the multidimensional
and long-term nature of ICT-based learning.

6. Ongoing Training Requirements: As technologies
evolve, trainers require continuous training, which
may face resistance.

7. Call for an Attitudinal Shift in Teaching and
Learning: There are psychological and social effects
of online digital education, perception of parents,
pupil teacher ratio to deal with. ICT primarily serves
as a communication tool, potentially increasing
transactional distance and raising concerns about
plagiarism.

ICT LEARNING CATEGORIES IN EDUCATION

Education within the realm of ICT is divided into three
main categories:

1. E-learning

2. Blended learning

3. Distance learning

Additionally, these categories can encompass face-to-
face, self-paced, and online collaborative learning.

E-learning or Electronic-Learning

E-learning leverages Advanced Learning Technologies
(ALT) to enhance human learning using advanced net-
worked and multimedia technologies. It overcomes tim-
ing, attendance, and travel limitations, encouraging
greater participation and interaction.

Blended Learning

Blended learning amalgamates diverse approaches to
education, combining face-to-face learning, self-paced
learning, and online classrooms.

(a) Face-to-Face Learning: Traditional classroom lea,.
ing with a faculty member delivering instructioy
to a group of learners through lectures, workshops
presentations, tutoring, and conferences. We need t
refer to UGC policy for this.

(b) Self-paced Learning: Self-paced learning offers fie,

ibility for learners to study at their own pace. Learner

engage with course material through various meang
including reading textbooks, web-based or CD-baseq
courses, pre-recorded classes, and internet research

Online Collaborative Learning: This form of learp

ing involves interactions between learners and facult

members through web-based platforms, enablin
both synchronous and asynchronous interactions

(discussed below)

(e

er]

Distance Learning

Distance learning allows students to work independently
from home or office, connecting with faculty and peers
through email, electronic forums, video conferencing,
chat rooms, instant messaging, and other computer-based .
communication methods. It is also known as open learn- |
ing. The internet, computer-based training (CBT), and the.
creation of ‘virtual classrooms’ facilitate this process.

‘Digital libraries’ created through ICTs provide stu-
dents, teachers, and professionals with access to research.
and course materials from any location at any time.
These facilities promote networking among academics
and researchers, enhancing the quality of teaching and
learning.

SYNCHRONOUS AND ASYNCHRONOUS [VIEDIA
ICT media can be categorized into two forms:

(a) Synchronous Media
e This requires all participants to be simultaneously
present, even when located in different places.

e Here, real time interaction and immediate.
response are required. :

e Examples include online chat, phone calls, instant
messaging, and video conferencing.

(b) Asynchronous Media
¢ This allows participants to engage in learning at
different times and places.

e Here, no real time interaction and immediate
response required.

e The examples include email, electronic mailing
lists, threaded conferencing systems, online dis-
cussion boards, wikis, blogs, voicemails etc.

As discussed, the role of ICT in higher education has
become even more critical. We have discussed SWAYAM,
SWAYAM Prabha, MOOGCs in unit 1. ICT is crucial for indi-
ual, societal and nation growth.

1. National Mission on Education through Informa-
tion and Communication Technology (NMEICT)
The following are included in this mission:

(a) High-speed Connectivity: It is imperative that
universities and colleges have access to high-
speed internet. The establishment of robust 1
Gbps connectivity for universities and virtual pri-
vate networks (VPN) for colleges has expanded,
making online learning more accessible.

(b) A-VIEW Software: A-VIEW software, initially
developed for teacher training, has grown into a
comprehensive platform for online education and
collaboration. It supports virtual classrooms, webi-
nars, and other interactive learning experiences.

(c) Content Repository: The N-list program, part of
the NMEICT, provides access to a vast repository

8.5

of e-books, e-journals, and research materials.
This resource is continually expanded to foster a
culture of research and learning.

Apart from the above, the NMEICT works with the some
of the following as a multifaceted education platform:

2. National Digital Library (NDL)
NDL is a pivotal project funded by the Ministry of
Education under the NMEICT.

* NDLserves asa unified repository that aggregates
diverse content from various Indian institutional
repositories.

¢ This comprehensive resource encompasses more
than 60 types of learning materials, including
books, articles, manuscripts, video lectures, the-

AccorbiING to SizE AND GONFIGURATION

There are four different types of computers which are
classified based on their size and configuration. These
have been discussed in the subsequent paragraphs.

Analog Computers

« Analog computers process continuous data, they use
data that changes smoothly, such as the temperature
on a thermometer or the volume on a stereo system.

e They were used in the past to transmit information,
such as radio and television signals.

e Examples of analog computers include thermom-
eters, vintage radios, and stereo systems.

Digital Computers

e Digital computers use data that is made up of separate
parts (discrete data), like the numbers 0 and 1.

° Digital computers are very accurate and fast, and can
be used to solve complex problems.

© They are used in many different fields, including sci-
ence, engineering, and technology.

e Examples of digital computers include personal com-
puters, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

Further division of digital computers

General-purpose computers: They are designed to per-
form a wide range of tasks. They are the most common
type of computer, and include personal computers (PCs),
laptops, tablets, and smartphones. General-purpose com-
puters have a central processing unit (CPU) that can be
programmed to perform different tasks. This flexibility
makes them ideal for a variety of applications, such as
word processing, web browsing, gaming, and running
software applications.

Special-purpose computers: They are designed to per-
form a specific task. They are often used in embedded sys-
tems, which are computer systems that are part of a larger

device. Examples of special-purpose computers include:

e¢ Microcontrollers: Microcontrollers are small, low-
power computers that are used in a variety of devices,
such as appliances, cars, and medical devices.

e Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs): FPGAs
are chips that can be programmed to perform specific
tasks. They are often used in high-performance com-
puting and aerospace applications.

e Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs):
ASICs are chips that are custom-designed for a spe-
cific application. They offer the best performance and
power efficiency, but they are also the most expensive
to develop.

Special vs General Computers

Special-purpose computers are usually more efficient 9
powerful than general-purpose computers as they ar
customised accordingly. :
' For example, GPUs are much faster than CPUs at
cessing graphics, making it ideal for gaming and vig,
editing. :

A GPU as a special purpose computer that is designeg
to process graphics, so it has a lot of transistors that ay,
dedicated to graphics processing.

A CPU, on the other hand, is designed to perform
wide range of tasks, so it has fewer transistors that ay
dedicated to graphics processing.

Embedded systems

Embedded systems are a type of special-purpose compute
that is part of a larger device. They are often used in con
sumer electronics, automotive, and industrial applications

The following points are concerned with the evolutio
of computing:
e The cost of computing has decreased dramaticall
over time. Thus, they have become more accessible

all over the world.

e The size and power consumption of computers hav
also decreased dramatically. Examples are smart
phones and wearable devices.

e The performance of computers has increased dramat-
ically. That helps in the solution of complex problems,

Hybrid Computers

° Hybrid computers combine the best of analog and.
digital computers.
e They use analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog con-_
verters to transform data between continuous and dis-
crete forms. This conversion process allows hybrid com: _
puters to operate seamlessly in various applications.
e Examples of hybrid computers include hospital ICU
computers and flight simulators.

e Many manufacturers now market their machines as

‘servers’ or ‘high-performance workstations,’ regard-
less of their size or power. This has happened due
to the fact that performance of minicomputers has
increased significantly. ,
Examples: They are used in a variety of tasks, such
as accounting, inventory management, CRM etc. And
also in teaching and research. The examples include
DEC PDP-11, IBM System/36, HP 3000, Data General
Eclipse, Tandem NonStop.

Workstations

° Graphic Power: Workstations are powerful, single-
user computers designed to handle large amounts of
data and complex tasks. They have robust graphics
capabilities.

e More Powerful than personal computers: They are
more powerful than personal computers but less pow-
erful than mainframes. Workstations offer a number
of advantages in comparison to personal computers,
including higher processing power, more memory,
better graphics capabilities, and greater reliability.

e Ideal for Design: They shine in tasks like desktop
publishing, software development, and engineering.

e Network Ready: Workstations can be linked in a
local area network (LAN) for office communication
and file-sharing.

Examples of workstation applications include
Computer-aided design (CAD), Computer-aided engi-
neering (CAE), Video editing, 3D rendering, Scientific
computing, Software development and AI.

Microcomputers (PCs)

Microcomputers, or PCs, have transformed personal and
business computing. They have the following features:

* Compact Design: They feature a screen, keyboard,
CPU, disk drives, and printer in a small package.

e Microprocessor Revolution: The invention of the
microprocessor made PCs affordable and accessible.

e Desktops: Stationary and powerful, ideal for offices
and homes.

e Laptops: Portable and powerful, great for on-the-go
work and entertainment.

e Handhelds (PDAs): Highly portable, designed for
organizing tasks and personal data. Less powerful but
perfect for their intended functions.

We must notice that the lines between mainframes,
minicomputers, workstations, and microcomputers have
become blurred in recent years. Many manufacturers now
market their machines as ‘servers’ or ‘high-performance
workstations’, regardless of their size or power.

CenTRAL Processine Unit (CPU)
CPU functions as a microprocessor, plays a pivotal role jn
orchestrating the execution of program instructions. Unlike
ICs, whichare dedicated to specific tasks, the programmes ¢;
microprocessor deals with diverse set of functions, such as:

« Arithmetic Operations: Performing mathematicg
calculations, such as addition, subtraction, division
multiplication, and comparisons.

e Logical Operations: Managing logical comparisons
and operations.

e Input/Output Operations: Facilitating the exchange
of data between the computer and external devices.

e Data Manipulations: Handling data transformation
and manipulations. ,

Key Components Within the CPU

The CPU comprises several integral components, each
contributing to its functionality: ;

1. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): The ALU specializes in
executing diverse calculations, encompassing arith
metic operations like addition and subtraction, as
well as more complex tasks like division, multiplica
tion, and comparisons.

2. Control Unit (CU): Responsible for coordinating
hardware operations, managing the flow and execu-
tion of data and instructions, and overseeing data
transfers between the main storage and the ALU o
storage devices.

3. Memory Unit (Main Storage): Serving as a reposi
tory for data, instructions, intermediate results, and

inal outcomes, the memory unit holds information
eady for processing and output. Data and instruc-
ions are directed to and from the main storage, all
nder the watchful control of the CU.

pU Scheduling (Enhancing Efficiency and
airness): Optimizing CPU utilization is vital to
chieving efficiency and fairness in a computer sys-
tem. CPU scheduling ensures that processes are allot-
‘ted CPU time, preventing delays related to resource
‘unavailability. Various algorithms, such as ‘First In
First Out (FIFO),’ ‘Last In First Out (LIFO),’ ‘Shortest
Job First (SJF),’ and ‘Round Robin’ with time-sharing
capabilities, help manage CPU resources effectively.

In modern computing, memory capacity has
expanded significantly. A ‘megabyte’ represents 1 mil-
lion bytes, a ‘gigabyte’ equates to 1 billion bytes, and
_a ‘terabyte’ encompasses a staggering 1 trillion bytes.
For instance, a computer with 64 megabytes of mem-
ory can store a wealth of 64 million bytes of data. This
has been discussed with the help of a diagram on page
8,18.

Registers (The Specialized Memory Units): Within
the CPU, high-speed, special-purpose memory units
known as registers play a pivotal role in program exe-
cution. These registers store critical information and
are primarily used for managing small data.

Motherboard (The Nerve Centre of System): The
computer’s main circuit board, the motherboard,
houses the CPU, memory, and expansion slots. These
expansion slots accommodate additional circuit
boards, often referred to as adapters or cards.

Buses (Data Highways): Buses serve as a set of paral-

lel pathways for connecting the CPU to various input
and output devices. These data highways facilitate

8.15

the bidirectional transmission of data between the
CPU and connected peripherals.

Peripheral Devices (Expanding Functionality):
Peripheral devices encompass a wide range of hard-
ware that can be connected to a computer, enhanc-
ing its capabilities. This category includes monitors,
keyboards, mice, webcams, drawing pads, joysticks,
modems, printers, scanners, interactive whiteboards,
and more.

9, Input Devices (Feeding Information): Any hard-
ware capable of inputting data into a computer system
is classified as an input device. Examples include key-
boards, microphones, mice, scanners, and webcams.

10. Output Devices (Translating Digital to Analog):

Output devices handle the presentation of processed
information, taking digital data and rendering it in
a usable format. These devices include monitors,
headphones, printers, speakers, plotters, and Visual
Display Units (VDUs).
Computer hardware, with its diverse components,
forms the bedrock of digital technology, enabling the
creation, manipulation, and storage of electronic data
while bridging the physical and digital realms.

Computer storage, often referred to as memory, encom-
passes the components and recording media that retain
digital data. The term ‘memory’ typically refers to both
temporary internal storage areas within a computer and
the physical chips capable of holding data. In some cases,
computers utilize virtual memory, extending their physi-
cal memory onto a hard drive.

Memory Types AND FUNCTIONS

Computer memory comes in various types, each striking a
balance between speed and cost:

Cache Memory: Cache memory is high speed volatile
memory that is located closest to the CPU. When the CPU
requests data from RAM, it checks the cache memory first
for faster access. Cache memory is designed to bridge the
speed gap between the CPU and main memory (RAM).

SRAM is typically used for small caches, so we need to
look at the following aspects for detailed idea:

* Cache memory is closely associated with SRAM
(Static Random Access Memory).

* SRAM employs flip-flops to store data bits.

° Flip-flops are bistable circuits, Which are the most
fundamental that is capable of maintaining either a 0
or 1 state.

® SRAM?’s fast data access is attributed to its ability to
access data without refreshing memory cells.

* Cache memory is divided into three levels: L1, L2, and
L3.

¢ 1 cache is the smallest and fastest cache mem-
ory that has a size of few kilobytes. L1 is located
on CPU or closest to CPU, L1 matters the most
for the speed of computer. L1 reduces the time it
takes for the CPU to fetch data from main mem-
ory. The main memory is located on a separate
chip that is slower than cache memory.

* L2cacheis positioned on a separate chip between
L1 cache and main memory. This acts as a buffer
for less frequently accessed data. The size may be
tens of kilobytes that is larger than that of L1.

To put this scene further, we can say that L2 cache
acts as a bridge between the L1 cache, which is
the fastest and smallest cache, and main mem-
ory, which is the largest and slowest memory.

* L3 cache: This cache is located on a separate
chip, it is megabytes or more in size. The speed is
less than L2. L3 is least expensive. The basic of L3
may be SRAM or DRAM.

RAM is known as the main memory. RAM is volatile,
means that data is lost when the computer is switched
off. Computers can both write data to and read dat
from RAM.
When the power is switched off, any data stored j
RAM is lost.

DRAM is a common type of system memory that j
used for larger main memory. This is a type of sem
conductor memory in computers. This is volatile, it
means that data is lost when the computer is turned
off. DRAM is generally more cost-effective than
SRAM. SRAM doesn’t require refreshing to retain
data, unlike DRAM needs to be refreshed periodically.
to prevent data loss.
DVD-RAM: DVD-RAM is basically Digital Versatil
Disc RAM which can be read and written to mult
ple times. These discs use phase-change technolo
where data is stored in the physical structure of the.
disc. These discs are more durable and less suscep-
tible to damage than CD-RW and DVD-R.

e following discussion helps the learners in the better
derstanding of the memory storage devices so that we
ve the absolute clarity of the data movement. This has
en discussed separately with data flow motives only:

Central Processing Unit: Consider CPU as the city cen-
tre, the hub of all major activities and decision-making,
_akin to the administrative headquarters of a city.
Registers: These are like immediate, small offices
_inside the CPU where swift data processing occurs,
closest to the city centre for rapid information access.
Cache and SRAM (Static RAM): The cache, sup-
ported by SRAM for its speed, is comparable to local,
fast-access storage facilities near the city centre
(CPU). They store data the CPU is likely to need soon,
offering quicker access than distant warehouses.

Bus: The bus system is the city’s transportation net-
work, connecting different parts like the CPU, RAM,
and storage devices. It facilitates data movement
within the computer, akin to roads in a city. A wider
bus (higher bandwidth) means more data can travel
at once, just as broader roads allow for more traffic.
RAM: RAM is like the city’s warehouses, storing more
data than caches or registers but with slower access.
It’s where active data (current applications and files)
is kept for quick retrieval by the CPU.

» ROM: Think of ROM as a museum or archive, hold-
ing crucial, unchangeable system data necessary
for boot-up and basic functioning, akin to the basic
instructions for starting the computer.

Hard Drive/Storage: These represent the city’s long-
term storage units or warehouses located on the out-
skirts, used for storing data that isn’t immediately
needed but is important for long-term retention.

nd these instructions cannot be accessed or modified —

8.17

Note: The above analogy highlights how the cost of each
computer component is influenced by its function, speed,
and proximity to the CPU (‘city centre’), much like real
estate prices vary based on location and facilities in a city.

The city centre is the costliest, and most complex due to

its central role in processing data. Storage components
such as Hard Drives are less expensive.

Memory Classification by Volatility
Memory can also be classified based on its volatility:

Volatile Memory: This temporary memory type only
retains data while power is supplied. RAM is a prime
example of volatile memory.

Non-Volatile Memory: Permanent in nature, this mem-
ory type retains data even after the system is powered off.
ROM is an instance of non-volatile memory.

Storage Devices Categories
Computer storage devices are divided into two categories:

(i) Internal Storage Devices: These devices are compo-
nents located inside a computer. For instance, Hard
disks, which are magnetic disks used for storing com-
puter data. They typically offer substantial storage
capacity and are traditionally known for their speed
and performance.

(ii) External Storage Devices: Portable storage devices
are commonly used for data mobility. Examples are:

° USB flash drives, often called pen drives or mem-
ory sticks.

e Optical discs like CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs.
USB flash drives are small, flat, and resemble
a pen in shape. They offer substantial storage
capacity and can be easily inserted into any com-
puter’s USB socket for data transfer.

HDD or SSD - The Storage Technology Choices

HDDs and SSDs are storage devices, with SSDs being the
newer technological innovation, so we buy systems with
SSDs.

Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)

e HDDS are also known as hard drives, are traditional
storage devices that have been widely used for
decades.

e They employ a rotating platter system to store data
magnetically. The platter consists of a thin, circular
disc coated with a magnetic material.

e As the platter spins at high speeds, read/write heads
hover close to the surface, reading and modifying the
magnetic patterns that represent data.

Advantages of HDDs

1. Cost-Effective: HDDs offer a significant cost advan-
tage compared to solid-state drives (SSDs). HDDs are
much economical and thus attractive in terms of Per
gigabyte or terabyte storage.

2. Large Storage Capacities: This makes them ideal for

bulk data storage. They can store large media files, .

such as movies, photos, and documents. HDDs have
better secondary storage capacity, thus, costlier SSDs
can store less frequently accessed data.

3, Wide Compatibility: HDDs are more compatible
with computers, laptops, servers, and external enclo-

sures. Their standardized interface ensures seamless
integration into various systems.

HDDs have the limitations of slower performance, sus-
ceptibility to damage, noise generation etc.
SSD (Solid State Drive) — .

° §SDs utilize flash memory, with individual memory
cells instantly accessible by the controller. SSDs have
no moving parts.

e SSDs are suitable for storing operating systems, gam-
ing apps, and frequently used files.

° §SDs have no moving parts, so they are less suscep-
tible to physical damage from shock or vibration.

° The failure rate of SSDs lower in comparison to HDDs.

° Additionally, SSDs have faster boot times, faster appli-
cation loading times, quieter operation and lower
power consumption.

Booting and Rebooting

Booting: This process initiates a computer when pow-
ered on. It may be triggered by hardware or software
commands. During booting, the CPU lacks software in
its main memory, necessitating the loading of software
before execution. This can be performed by hardware or
firmware within the CPU or a separate processor.

Rebooting: Rebooting is the act of restarting a computer,
achievable in two ways. A ‘hard’ reboot involves pow-
ering off and then on. A ‘soft’ reboot maintains power
continuity.

Computer storage devices serve as the memory banks of
digital systems, ensuring data persistence, quick retrieval,
and streamlined operations, bridging the gap between
volatile processing and permanent data retention.

when to do it, and how to do it. When software is stored

a PC, it’s termed firmware, falling between software and
hardware. ;

SYSTEM SOFTWARE

This category is responsible for enabling the basic fyy
tions of a computer, ensuring it runs efficiently, and ma
aging hardware resources. It includes drivers, operat;
systems (OSs), servers, and utilities. The primary comp.
nents of system software are the OS and utility software

Types of System Software

1. Compilers: Let’s look at source code and object Co,
first. . .

Source code is the hurnan-readable version of a co
puter program. {t is written in a programming la
guage, such as Python, Java, or C++. This is typica
written in a text editor.
Object code is the machine-readable version of
computer program. It is generated. by a compile
which converts the source code into a form that cq
be executed by the computer’s CPU.

Compliers convert source code from program
ming languages into object code. This happens du
to the reason that object code is more efficient f
the computer to execute than source code. And th
object code is more portable than source code,
means that object code can be executed on any com
puter. Examples include ALGOL, BASIC, C++, an
FORTRAN compilers.

Operating System (OS): The OS controls all oth
resources in a computer system, coming in differer
bit architectures like 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit. Exam
ples include Unix/BSD, GNU/Linux, Windows, Ma
OS, embedded, real-time OS, and experimental O
like Oberon/Bluebottle and Plan 9.

Background on OS: Windows, developed in 198
added a graphical user interface (GUD to MS-DO
Mac OS was one of the early OSs with a GUI. Linux,
developed by Linus Torvalds, is a freely available
multi-tasking and multi-user OS released under th
General Public License (GPL).

3. Utility Software: Designed to aid in analyzing, mon
toring, configuring, optimizing settings, and main
taining the computer. Examples are:
° Media Player Skins: These are customizabl

interfaces that allow users to change the look and
feel of their media playback software.

¢ DVD Burners: Hardware or software tools used t

write data onto writable DVDs for storage or pla
back, though their popularity decreased now.

Antivirus Software: Programs designed to detect,
prevent, and remove malicious software, viruses,
and other security threats from computers.

Desktop Widgets: Small applications or tools
that run on the desktop, providing quick access
to information and tasks.

Backup Software: Applications used to create
copies of data ensure that important files are safe
and can be recovered in case of loss or damage

Application Software: This type of software assists
users in performing specific tasks. It’s divided into:

¢ Productivity Software: Examples encompass
' word processors, spreadsheets, schedulers, data-
base management systems (DBMS), desktop pub-
lishing tools, and. enterprise resource planning
(ERP) software.

e Collaborative Software: Also known as group-
ware software, these facilitate collaboration, with
applications like Facebook and Etherpad.

Proprietary vs. Open Seftware: Software can be
proprietary (closed) or open. Proprietary software
is privately owned and controlled, with undisclosed
_ specifications to prevent duplication. Open software
_ is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to create add-
on products and understand its design.

might be distribution restrictions.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

Programming languages are tools for telling computers
hat to de. They come in different levels of complexity.
Below is the user friendly overview of languages:

1. Machine Language

* This is basically the first generational language.

¢ This is the ianguage computers understand, using
Os and 1s.

* It’s hard for humans to use because it’s ail in
binary code.

* Programmers now prefer high level programming
language or an assembly language.

2. Assembly Language

® This is a step up, actually a second generational
language and this is also known as symbolic
machine code.

* It uses ‘names’ for instructions and variables,
instead of numbers, thus making it more readable
than machine language.

e For example, it uses words like MOV and ADD
instead of just Os and 1s.

3. High-Level Language (HLL)
e These are the languages most programmers use
today, like C-++ and Java.

Freeware: it’s software that can be copied and used

e They’re very readable because they use English
words.

e HLL programs are translated into assembly or
machine language by a compiler or interpreter.

A Learner should note the following:

* First and second-generation languages are low-
level (machine and assembly).

° Third, fourth, and fifth-generation languages are
high-level (HLL).

Program

* A program isa set of instructions for the computer.

* Computers read these instructions as 1s and Os.

° Programs can be written in assembly or HLL and are
initially called source programs.

° They need to be translated into machine language to
run.

Language Processors

° Assembler: Converts
machine language.

* Interpreter: Translates HLL programs line by line
and reports errors immediately.

* Compiler: Translates the entire HLL program at once,
reporting all errors at the end. Once errors are fixed,
you don’t need the compiler in memory anymore
because you have an object program.

This basic overview should help us to understand the
different levels of programming languages and how pro-
grams are created for computers.

8.20 :

When data is entered into a computer, the numbers 61
words we understand are translated into a binary numb
system (Figure 8.5). Binary language is the language 0
computers.

Everything you type, input, output, send, retrieve.
draw and so on, in the end, is converted to the computer's
native language, that is binary.

Binary Numeer System

Formally, we all know that base-10 system is a positional
system.

In decimal notation, we write a number as a string o
symbols, where each symbol is one of these 10 digits, a’
to interpret a decimal number, we multiply each digit b
the power of 10 associated with that digit’s position.

The binary system uses only two symbols, 0 and 1, te
represent values.

Computers are built from transistors and an individual
transistor can only be ON or OFF (two options).

Thus, the values in a binary system, such as 0’s and.
1’s, are called binary digits or bits. Computers use base
because they can recognize only two values, 1 or 0.

Binary Digit (Bit)
It is a digit within the binary number system. A bit is the
smallest unit of information held in a computer. In ordey

to make the bits useful, they are combined into bytes of
information.

Byte

It is a combination of bits that represents one characte;
A byte is usually composed of 8 bits.

American Standard Code for information
interexchange (ASCII)

It assigns a specific pattern of (ASCII) to each char.
acter as described earlier. Another code that may be
found, especially in IBM brand mainframe computers,

(EBCDIC).

Extended Binary Coded Decimal
Interchange Code

The important point to remember about these codes is that
their main value is to store information so that it is read-
able by other computers. By using ASCII or EBCDIC, it is
possible for people to retrieve and use someone else’s data
using a different type of hardware or software. The main
disadvantage of using ASCII is that formatting or other
special qualities of computer-ized information may be lost.

0% InvRANET ~ For INTERNAL COMMUNICATION

OF. Intranet is basically a Private Network, that functions as
o 4 Intranet as a dedicated network exclusively for a company’s

employees, thus it greatly enhances internal communication.

8.23

° Secure Environment: Intranet provides a safe envi-
ronment as a protected platform.

* Resource Allocation: Intranet works as a ‘repository
of resources, for internal users.

© Firewall Protection: Intranet is often isolated from
the broader internet by firewalls, that again helps in
the privacy of internal communication.

° Overcoming Limitations: Intranets address con-
straints associated with conventional LANs and WANs.

Technological Backbone

* Common Technology: Intranets operate on widely
adopted technologies which functions with Telnet,
File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or Gopher, it is the web
that predominantly prevails.

° User-Friendly Web Interface: Leveraging the web
and its familiar browsers offers a cornfortable and
well-known interface for most intranet users.

Enabling Technology

e Empowering Users: Intranets act as technology
enablers, delivering domain-specific resources.

° Authentication Methods: User authentication can
occur through server permissions, database-based
techniques, firewalls, IP-based verification, or a com-
bination of these.

° Key Technologies: Employed technologies encom-
pass databases (e.g., Access, SQL Server, MySQL),
XML, HTML or XHTML-based forms, and web script-
ing (e.g., ASP, PHP, ColdFusion).

° A foundational understanding of computers can be
advantageous for users.

Core Features of Intranets

° Shared Folders: A fundamental intranet often com-
prises shared folders linked to the network, their vis-
ibility depends upon the user’s permission levels.

e The Knowledge Sharing is facilitated through ease
of access and use, universal information access for
small businesses, person-to-person interaction, and
some informal networks.

Extranets: Extending the Reach

° Extranets are a similar concept to intranets, but their
implementation differs.

° An extranet is also a controlled, private network that
extends beyond a company’s internal boundaries,
allowing geographically dispersed employees, such as
partners, clients, or suppliers, to connect securely.

° Extranets provide authorized users with access to lim-
ited resources, enabling secure collaboration with an
organization.

Network TorpoLocy

The network topology plays a critical role in the design
and implementation of both intranets and extranets. It
influences how devices are connected, data flows, and
how security and access controls are managed within
these private networks, that is mainly the arrangement

of cables, computers, and other peripherals. They play an
important role in workstations or nodes within computer
systems. The main categories of Network topologies are
as follows:

1. Bus Topology: In this configuration, each computer
is connected to a central (single) cable, similar to a
bus.

2. Star Topology: This topology features a central

hub or switch box to which all workstations connect

directly.

Ring Topology: In a ring topology, each device is con-

nected to exactly two neighbouring devices, forming

a closed loop.

4. Mesh Topology: Every computer in a mesh topology
is connected to every other computer, enabling mes-
sages to take multiple paths.

5. Tree Topology: A tree topology is a hybrid structure
that combines two or more star networks into a more
complex arrangement.

6. Hybrid Topology: This could be a combination of any
of the above, showing interconnections between dif-
ferent types of topologies, like a star connected to a
bus topology.

Computer Virus

A computer virus is like a sneaky, bad software program
called ‘malware.’ It can harm our computer in different
ways. Here’s we can see what they can do:

e Harm Data: Viruses can damage or delete your com-
puter’s programs and files.

e Quick Replication: They’re like speedy copy
machines, creating duplicates of themselves.

e Widespread Damage: They spread to different areas,
harming your computer’s data, even the ‘boot’ section
of your hard drive. .

How Do Viruses Enter Into the Systems?

1. Downloading Files: When you download stuff from
the internet.
2. Removable Media: Like USB drives, which might
- carry viruses.
3, Pen Drives: Be cautious with pen drives; they can
spread viruses.

apter g:

4. Mail Attachments:
might invite viruses.

5. Unpatched Software: Using software that hag
been updated can make your computer vulnerabje

6. Weak Passwords: Simple or unprotected Passwor,
can let viruses in.

Types of Viruses

Viruses cover a wide range of behaviours and characterig
tics, but the world of cybersecurity is ever-evolving. Ney
types of viruses and malware are continuously being dey,
oped by malicious actors. The common types are as follow.

File Infector Viruses: These viruses attach themselves tg
executable files, such as .exe or .com files. When we ryp
an infected program, the virus spreads to other files ang
can also propagate to other computers when we share
those files. They act surreptitiously, hiding within seey,
ingly normal files.

1. Simple Virus: Think of these viruses as sneaky troy.
blemakers that focus on program files, like the so
ware you use. They spread when you run a specific
program. It’s like a hidden surprise inside a gift box,
and the surprise isn’t good!

2. Encrypted Virus: Encrypted viruses are like digita|
spies. They infect different kinds of files but act just like
secret agents, hiding within files to avoid being caught.

3. Polymorphic Virus: These viruses are like ‘shape.
shifters’ in a spy movie. They can hide inside files,
especially those important executable files. They con-
stantly change their appearance to stay hidden, just
like secret agents trying to disguise themselves.

4. Bombs: Imagine these viruses as time bombs. They
can infect and hide inside specific types of files, and
they only go off at a particular time. It’s like a ticking
time bomb in your computer!

5. File Infector Virus: This virus is a true secret agent.
It directly targets and hides within executable files,
like those with extensions .exe or .com. They sneak
around like spies in your computer files. :

The other types are also given below, although they also
function as secret viruses.

1, Macro Computer Virus: These are like tiny trouble:

making agents hiding inside your computer files.

They can quickly spread, especially in programs like

Microsoft Word and Excel. It’s as if they wear a dis-

guise to blend in with your work.

Trojan Horse: These tricky viruses pretend to be

harmless, just like a gift that looks nice on the outside

but has something bad inside. They are often called

‘Social Engineering Viruses’ because they trick you

into letting them in. ,

3. Worms: These viruses are like speedy messengers
that move from one computer to another, causing
chaos as they go. They are often known as ‘network
viruses’ because they travel through computer net
works, much like how germs can spread from person
to person.

poot Sector Computer Virus

_. Aboot sector virus is a type of malicious software
or malware. These focus on infecting the boot
record of digital storage devices. They affect com-
puter’s hard disk, DVDs, CDs, and floppy disks.

- Boot sector viruses can be introduced to a com-
puter at any time. However, they only become
active when the computer’s boot record is
accessed or executed during the startup process.
e Once activated, these viruses are notoriously dif-
ficult to remove as they embed themselves deep
within the system.

e With the reduced, the presence of boot sector
viruses has declined over time with use of floppy
disks and changes in technology.

.. Master Boot Record Virus

¢ Infects the critical Master Boot Record on a hard
drive.

e They overwrite MBR code, they seize system con-
trol on boot.

e They spread through bootable media, like USB
drives.

Their removal is more challenging, often requir-
ing specialized tools.

The above two Boot and Master Boot viruses are called
‘system-level viruses’.

impact of Viruses

. Disrupts your computer’s normal functionality.
. Changes your computer’s settings.

. Disrupts your network use.

: Destroys important data.

. Affects your computer network resources.

rotecting Your Computer

. Install effective antivirus software.

. Keep your operating system and software updated.
. Use strong, secure passwords.

. Employ firewalls to block viruses.

INTERNET Basics

¢ The internet is an information superhighway for
accessing data online.

* The concept of the internet started in 1969 through
ARPANET, developed by the U.S. Department of
Defense for government communication.

Main Applications and Benefits of Internet

1. Communication: Easily connect with people world-
wide through social media platformis like Email, Face-
book, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, video confer-
encing, voice over IP (VoIP).

2. information and Entertainment: Find information
and enjoy online entertainment.

3. Services: Access various services like banking, shop-
ping, ticket booking, and email.

4. E-commerce: online business, online banking, online
payments.

5. Research: Use the internet for research purposes.

6. Work From Home: Work remotely, especially during
events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

7. Mapping Services: Access mapping services like
Street Views (expected in India in 2022).

8. Productivity: Remote work, online collaboration,
project management, customer relationship manage-
ment (CRM)

9. Government: Electronic government (e-govern-

ment), citizen services, tax filing, passport renewal
etc.

In addition to these main applications, the internet is
also used for a wide variety of other purposes, such as
gaming, healthcare, and transportation.

Figure 8.8 Internet Basic Elements

Basic Internet Mechanism

° Internet relies on the Transmission Control Protocol/
Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).

* Data transmission requires an address and a secure
way to move electronic signals.

° TCP and IP are the fundamental protocols for sending
and receiving data.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

° Divides data into packets for sending and receiving.
° Specifies rules for reassembling data and ensuring
damage-free delivery.

IP (Internet Protocol)

e Adds destination addressing information to data
packets.

® The address is written as user@host.domain.

° Hosts are individual machines whose resources are
shared among users.

° Every host and router on the internet has an IP address.

IP Address

* Consists of four sets of numbers separated by dots.

® Each part is anumber from 0 to 255.

° DNS (Domain Name Server) assigns names to IP
addresses.

° IP addresses are organized from left to right.

IP Versions

° IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses.
° . IPv6, developed in 1995, uses 128-bit addresses.
° IPv12 is seen as a protocol of the future.

Other Internet Protocols

1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Defines com-
munication format between web browsers and servers

2. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol): Formats
communication between email servers and clients.

3. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer): Transmits private doc-
uments securely.

4. FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Standardizes file
transmission formats.

5. TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol}: Allows file
transfer between network devices. ‘

6. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Exchanges
network-based emails.

7. Telnet: Connects a computer with a remote host on
the internet.

8. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Formats
web page appearances and creates hypertext links.

9. OSI (Open Systems Interconnection): Describes

the seven-layer model for network communication.

SSL/TLS: SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) is cru-
cial for securing internet communications and is widely

used to protect data transmitted over the Internet, they
are not part of the fundamental set of Internet protocols

like HTTP, TCP/IP, DNS, or SMTP. SSL and TLS operate at.

the transport layer to provide secure communication over
existing Internet protocols.

RDWARE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INTERNET

dem (Modulater and Demodulator): Connects com-
ers to the internet by converting and re-converting
1
b: Hub receives data from one or more direction that
ent to other direction/s. Hub is a connection point for
etworked computers and devices, typically used in local
rea networks (LANs).

dge: A bridge is a network device that connects two or
re networks, such as one LAN to another LAN

hat uses the same protocol (Ethernet or token ring).

outer: Manages and forwards data packets between
omputer networks, determining their destination.

eway: A gateway is a network device that connects
or more networks with different protocols. For exarn-
le, a gateway can be used to connect a local area network
LAN) to a wide area network (WAN). Gateway facilitates
ommunication between networks with different proto-
ols, converting one into another. Hardware examples of
ateways include connectors, cables, adapters, circuits,

nd switches.

NTERNET Service Proviper (ISP)

LISP is a company that offers a subscription service to
low individuals or organizations to connect to the inter-
et. ISPs have a network of computers that are always
inked to the internet. Some {SPs also provide dedicated
nes for a more reliable connection. Additionally, ISPs
ffer email addresses and website space on the World
ide Web (WWW).

AIN INTERNET CONNECTION OPTIONS

© connect to the internet, you can choose from several
chnology options:

. Dial-wp Connection: This uses an analog telephone
line to establish a temporary connection. It converts
a computer’s digital signals into analog signals.
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) can be
used for this purpose without a modem. This type is
referred to as ‘wired ether.’

. Cable TV Connections: Homes with cable TV can use
a cable modem for internet access.

. Digital Subscriber Line (DSL): DSL operates over
regular copper telephone lines. There are two types:

8.27

G@ Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) offers
different bandwidths for upstream and downstream
data. Gii) Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL)
provides the same bandwidth in both directions.

_ 4, Satellite Connection: This is similar to receiving TV

signals directly from a satellite.

5. Bluetooth: Bluetooth is a wireless technology that
enables data exchange over short distances, typically
within about 30 feet. It allows wireless communica-
tion between computers, cell phones, and other elec-
tronic devices.

6. Broadband: Broadband utilizes various high-capac-
ity transmission technologies to transmit data, voice,
and video over long distances at high speeds. It com-
monly uses coaxial cables, fiber optic cables, and radio
waves. Broadband connections are always active
and do not require dial-up. In 2021, India’s Telecom
Regulatory Authority proposed a minimum speed of
2 Mbps for broadband connections.

7. WiFi (Wireless Fidelity}: WiFi, also known as high-
frequency wireless local area networks (LAN), enables
wireless data transmission within a local area. Many
places like hotels, educational institutions, railways,
and airports offer WiFi access. It supports different
IEEE standards and can be used for various types
of networks, including LAN, MAN, PAN, and WAN.
WiMax is another wireless technology used to provide
internet services, including mobile data and hotspots.

8. Leased Line: A leased line is a dedicated data con-
nection with a fixed bandwidth. Organizations use
it to connect to the internet securely arid efficiently.
Leased lines offer maximum download capacity and
reliability. They are symmetrical, uncontended (can-
not be shared), and point-to-point.

Fiber optic internet, capable of reaching speeds up
to 940 Mbps, is another broadband connection option
known for low latency.

INTERNET Basics

The internet is like a superhighway for information. It
allows you to access specific data stored on various com-
puters worldwide. This system was created in the 1970s,
and it’s made up of different components. The most well-
known part of it is the World Wide Web (WWW), which is
different from the entire internet.

Woartp Wine Wes (WWW)

The WWW was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989
while he was working at CERN. WWW is based on three
key technologies: HTML, URL, and HTTP, which are
essential for the web as we know it today. The public ver-
sion of the WWW started in 1993.

CERN In General - CERN is a top European research
organization in Geneva, known for high-energy physics
research. Notably, they developed the LHC (Large Hadron
Collider), the world’s largest particle accelerator. CERN’s
work advances our understanding of fundamental par-
ticles and physics, including the 2012 discovery of the
Higgs boson.

Web Browsers

We use web browsers to explore the WWW. These are
like special tools that help us interact with the internet.
They retrieve information from the web and show it to us.
Popular examples are Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox,
Opera, and Safari.

Bookmarks

Web browsers allow you to bookmark your favourite web-
sites, so you can easily revisit them.

Domain Name

Domain names are the unique names that identify web-
sites on the internet. They typicallyhave a suffixlike‘com’
for commercial sites or ‘“.edu’ for educational ones.

1. .com: Commercial institutions or organization
.edu: Educational institutions

.gov: Government sites

-mil: Military sites

net: Gateways and administrative hosts

.org: Private organizations

AAW

Domain Name Server (DNS): Mapping Domain
Names to IP Addresses

A DNS server translates domain names (such as google.
com) into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (such as
192.168.1.1). IP addresses are the ‘numerical addresses’
that are assigned to all devices connected to the Internet.
Thus, DNS servers are essential for navigating the inter-
net because they allow our computers to find and com-
municate with websites by their human-readable domain
names instead of needing to remember numerical IP
addresses.

How DNS Servers Work?

i. When you type a website’s domain name (like www.
example.com) into your web browser, your browser asks
a DNS server for the IP address linked to that domain.
¢ The DNS server first checks if it knows the IP
address from before (in its cache). If it does, it
provides the IP to your browser.
e Ifthe DNS server doesn’t have the IP in its cache, it
will ask other DNS servers until it finds the correct IP.

2. Once the DNS server gets the right IP address, Your
browser uses it to connect to the web server (whe;
the website is stored).

¢ Your browser then requests the specific conten,
you want from the web server.

* The web server sends that content back to yoy
_browser, which shows it on your screen.

Home Page

The home page of a website is like the book’s title Page
and table of contents. It acts as an index to all the content
on the site, similar to how a book’s table of contents lists
what's inside. This page identifies the site and has links
to other pages within the website, accessible using a weh
browser like Microsoft Explorer. :

Hyperlinks

A hyperlink is an element in a web page that facilitates.
navigation to another web page or to another part of the
same web page.

Web pages are filled with links, which can be under
lined or a different colour. When you click one, it takes
you to another part of the same page or a different page.

Firewall

A firewall is a software program that protects your com-
puter from unauthorized access, while connected to the
internet. It keeps an eye on the data going to and from
your computer and warns you about anything suspicious.

Search Engines

A search engine is a website that allows you to search for
information on the WWW. They look for keywords in doc-
uments and show you a list of pages where those words
are found. Some popular search engines include Google,
Bing, and Yahoo.

Meta Search Engines

Meta Search Engines save time by searching multiple
search engines at once. It is like a search tool that asks
many other search engines for help. It collects the results

and shows them together in one list.

Wide Area Information Server (WAIS) is a system on
the internet. It makes special databases about different
subjects. These databases are on many servers. WAIS
keeps track of them.

Some examples of Meta Search Engines are All4one
and MetaCrawler.

EmaiL — ELectronic Mait

Email is a method of sending text messages between com-
puters over the internet. It’s a fast and secure way of com-
munication, more efficient than traditional mail. Email
provides a timestamp for messages, organizes conversa-
tions, and is easy to save.

Email Address Structure: An email address consists of
three parts:

1. Username: The chosen name for the email.
2. @ Symbol: Separates the username from the domain.

3. Domain: Indicates the email server’s location, includ-
ing the mail server and top-level domain (e.g., .com).

Types of Email Services: Email services are typically
divided into three categories:

1. Free Web-based Email: Commonly used and acces-
sible through web browsers.

2. Priced Web-based Email: Premium accounts offer-
ing extra features.

3. Private Email: Used by organizations with their own
mail servers, providing accounts to members.

Email Structure and Features: Emails have twomain parts:

° Header: Contains sender, receiver, subject, and other
details.

* Body: The actual message text. Emails can be saved,
have reminders set, use spellcheck, and support
attachments. Folders help organize messages, and fil-
ters sort them automatically.

Functioning of Email Systems

1. Protocols: The most essential manages email
retrieval and viewing from a server, and facilitates
access across multiple devices. SMTP handles email
sending and delivery between clients and servers.

Delivery Agent: Mail Server functions as an interme-
diary in email systems, this processes and forwards
emails. There are features such as email storage, fil-
tering, and automatic responses.

3. Access Client: Email Clients such as Gmail or
Microsoft Outlook, provide the user interface for
accessing and managing emails. They support func-
tions like reading, composing, and storing messages.

N

Instant Messaging: Instant messaging is real-time com-
munication involving text, audio, or video:

* This includes chat, chat rooms, file sharing, and
mobile capabilities.

NMiosite Apps

Mobile apps simplify tasks with a simple click for most
users. To tech-savvy individuals, they are software appli-
cations designed to run on mobile devices like iPhones,
smartphones, and tablets. Apps are broadly classified into
two categories:

1. Web Apps: These apps are accessed through a web
browser over the internet, such as Google Chrome or
Mozilla Firefox. They are functional, interactive, and
don’t require downloads. Web apps use standard web
technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They
can run on any device with a web browser, regardless
of the operating system.

2. Mobile Apps: Mobile apps can be divided into two types:
° Native Apps: These apps are specifically designed for
particular platforms like iOS, Android, or Windows.
They are more complex compared to web apps and
require separate development for each platform.
¢ Hybrid Apps: Hybrid apps combine features of
both native and web apps. They are installed like
native apps but offer a web app-like experience.
Hybrid apps are built using JavaScript, HTML,
and CSS and utilize a simplified browser within
the app (known as a web view).

Virtual ConFrerRENCcING MetHops

another, simulating real in-person conferences.

e Multiple callers can join an audio conference by dial-
ing into a conference bridge and using access num-
bers and conference IDs.

° Itoffers cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and time-sav-
ing advantages but lacks visual interactions, which
can lead to potential distractions.

e The two most common codecs used are G.711 and G.729.
G.711 is a wideband codec that provides high-quality
audio, but it requires more bandwidth. G.729 is a nar-
rowband codec that uses less bandwidth, but it also
provides lower-quality audio.

e Audio conferencing bridges can be either hardware-
based or software-based. Hardware-based bridges are
typically more expensive, but they offer better perfor-
mance and scalability. Software-based bridges are less
expensive, but they may not be as reliable or scalable.

Video Conferencing

e Video conferencing enables participants at different loca-
tions to conduct virtual conferences where they can see
and hear each other, as if they were in the same room.

° It involves endpoints like cameras and microphones,
an MCU (multi-point control unit or server), and
network connections. During a point-to-point video
call, participants’ voices and images are converted
from analog to digital and back to analog when sent
through the software.

e Codecs like H.264 and VP8 are commonly. used to
compress and decompress video signals.

* Video conferencing bridges can be hardware-based
or software-based, with hardware bridges being pre-
ferred for high-quality video.

® Video conferencing requires a higher bandwidth than
audio conferencing.

Note that audio conferencing is typically more toler-

ant of network latency than video conferencing. This is

because video conferencing requires a constant stream of
data to be transmitted in real time.

Teleconferencing

° This technology combines audio and video confer-
encing to connect participants via telephone or video
communication.

e Main Protocols: Three basic protocols include:

1. SIP (Session Initiation Protocol): This signal-
ling protocol is used to establish, modify, and ter-
minate teleconferencing sessions.

2. RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol): This trans-
port protocol is used to transmit audio and video
data between participants.

3. RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol):
This control protocol is used to monitor the qual-
ity of the teleconferencing session and to provide
feedback to the participants.

¢ Teleconferencing software includes the following:

1. Open source software: Examples are
FreeSWITCH and Asterisk to create and manage
teleconferencing systems.

2. Commercial software: Examples are Microsoft
Skype for Business and Cisco Webex.

° It is used by organizations like the UNHCR, which
employs tools like Skype for Business and Cisco WebEx
to facilitate remote communication and collaboration.

These virtual conferencing methods break down geo-
graphical barriers, making it easier for individuals and
organizations to connect, share information, and conduct
meetings without the need for physical presence. This is
used for business meetings, training sessions, educational
seminars, and social gatherings.

HD (High Definition) and SD (Standard
Definition)

The main difference between HD and SD videos is the res-
olution, impacting the video quality, file size, and band-
width requirements.

HD (High Definition): HD video offers a higher reg,
tion than SD. This means that the picture is clearey E
more detailed.

SD (Standard Definition): SD video has a lower rego
tion than HD. The most common SD resolution is 486
with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels.

°

Video Uploading and Downloading
The main points are as follow:

1.

id

Other points are privacy, security, storage space afl
device capability (such as smartphones, tablets, compu
ers).

Common HD resolutions include 720p and 10g
where the number refers to the vertical pixels

example, 1080p has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixel
HD video requires more storage space and bandwj
for streaming compared to SD due to the large;
size.

While SD video is not as sharp and detailed as HH
requires less storage space and bandwidth, makin,
a practical choice for slower internet connections 9
limited storage capacity.
SD has been the standard for many years, particular}
in traditional broadcasting, but it’s increasingly bein,
replaced by HD.

File Size and Format:
e There is longer time taken by larger, high-quali
video files (HD, 4K) to upload or download tha;
the smaller, standard definition files.
e File ‘size and compatibility with different pl
forms is influenced by video format such as MP.
AVI.

Internet Connection Speed:
¢ The speed of upload/download process depe
upon the speed of internet connection.
¢ During high internet traffic times, the limite
bandwidth can slow down the process.

Platforms and Services:
e Platforms such as YouTube, Dropbox have thei
own rules and features for uploading and down:
loading that may depend upon file size limits an
support for various formats.
e¢ The speed may depend upon the service also.

Data Transfer Protocols: Protocols like FTP °
HTTP/HTTPS are used for secure file transfer, wit
HTTPS offering added security and data integrity.
Video compression: This reduces the file size bu
can affect quality. So, maintaining a balance betwee
data reduction and quality is important.
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): CDNs c@
enhance the speed and reliability of video download
by caching content in multiple geographical location:

Social media tools encompass a wide range of applica-
ns and platforms that facilitate online social interac-
ns and content sharing. Their categorical brief descrip-
tion is given here so that students get collective idea:

. Networking Platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn):
These platforms are used for connecting with friends,
family, and professional contacts. They offer features
like profile creation, news feed updates, messaging,
and group discussions.

Microblogging Sites (Twitter, Tumblr): These are
platforms where users post short messages, updates,
or other content such as images, videos, and links.
They are known for real-time information sharing
and are popular for news and trends.

Photo Sharing Apps (Instagram, Snapchat): These
tools focus on image and video sharing. Users can
post pictures and videos, often with various filters
and editing tools, and engage with others through
likes, comments, and reposts.

4. Video Sharing Platforms (YouTube, Vimeo): These
sites allow users to upload, share, and view videos.
They are widely used for entertainment, educational
content, and marketing.

Content Curation and Bookmarking (Pinterest,
Reddit): These platforms enable users to discover,
save, and share content based on their interests.
They often organize content into boards or specific
categories.

. Messaging Apps (WhatsApp, Telegram): These
are used for direct personal messaging, group chats,
and voice/video calls. They offer a more private way
of communication compared to public social media
platforms.

= 819.2 seconds or 819.2/60 minutes = 13.65 minutes

7. Blogging and Forum Platforms (WordPress,
Quora): These tools provide spaces for more extended
and detailed content, such as blog posts, and allow for
community discussions and Q&A sessions.

Each of these tools serves different purposes but com-
monly enhances digital communication, community
building, content sharing, and information dissemination
within the social media ecosystem.

In 1954, W. Howard Gammon wrote an e-government
research paper on the use of ICT for providing good gov-
ernance. Today, ICT, suchas the internet, SMS, and mobile
apps, are widely used to access information quickly and
cheaply. They are also used in education, banking, rail-
ways, and other government services.

E-governance is the use of ICT to support the admin-
istration or management of government. It is a way to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government
services. E-governance can also help to improve transpar-
ency and accountability, and to make government more
responsive to the needs of citizens.

The main components of e-governance include:

° Government-citizen interface: This includes online
services such as tax filing, passport applications, and
land record searches.

°¢ Government-government interface: This includes
the use of ICT to improve communication and col-
laboration between different government agencies.

* Government-business interface: This includes the
use of ICT to make it easier for businesses to interact
with the government, such as for online payments
and licensing.

e« Government-employee interface: This includes the
use of ICT to improve the productivity and efficiency
of government employees.

© Government-society interface: This includes the
use of ICT to engage with citizens and to get their
feedback on government policies and programs.

Figure 8.10 ICT’s Value in E-Governance

Benecirs of ICT-BaseD GOVERNANCE
The benefits are as follows:

e Automation of administrative processes: ICT can
be used to automate numerous government pro-
cesses, such as tax collection and passport processing.
This can save time and money, and improve the effi-
ciency and accuracy of government services.

e Better service delivery: ICT can be used to improve
the delivery of government services by making them
more accessible and convenient for citizens. For
example, citizens can now access many government
services online, from anywhere in the world.

¢ Transparency and accountability: ICT can be used
to improve transparency and accountability by mak-
ing government information more accessible to citi-
zens. For example, governments can publish their
budgets and financial reports online, so that citizens
can see how their tax money is being spent.

e Citizen participation: ICT can be used to make it
easier for citizens to participate in government deci-
sion-making and service delivery. For example, gov-
ernments can use online surveys and forums to col-
lect feedback from citizens on policy proposals and
service delivery.

CHALLENGES OF E-GOVERNANCE

Despite the many benefits of e-governance, there are also
some challenges that need to be addressed. These chal-
lenges include:

e Lack of resources: Several government agencies do
not have the resources to implement and maintain
ICT-based systems.

e Lack of infrastructure: Many rural areas do not have
access to reliable electricity and internet connectivity.

© Digital divide: Not everyone has access to ICT tools
and resources.

e Security concerns: There are concerns about the
security of government data and systems.

e Reluctance to change: Some government employees

- may be reluctant to change their traditional ways of
working.

* Community Information Centres (CICs): Thesecen:
tres provide rural communities with access to comput
ers and the internet. They also offer training on how
to use ICT for a variety of purposes, such as accessin
government services and finding information.

ICT works as a powerful tool that can be used t
improve governance. E-governance initiatives can help
to make government more efficient, effective, transpar-
ent, and accountable. They can also improve the deliver
of government services and to make government more
responsive to the needs of citizens.

The term ‘environment’ is derived from the French word
‘environner, that means ‘to surround.’ According to the
Environment (Protection) Act of 1986, the environment
encompasses all the physical and biological surround-
ings of an organism and the interactions within them.
It is defined as the collective composition of water, air,
land, and the intricate interconnections that exist among
these elements, as well as with human beings, other living
organisms, and materials.

Environmental Determinism And Possibilism: We
need to understand the following two approaches and
understand the shift from one to another.

* Environmental Determinism: This is the idea that
the physical environment, particularly the climate
and terrain, actively shapes cultures, societies, and
behaviours of individuals. It suggests a strong influ-
ence of the environment on human behaviour and
culture.

¢ Environmental Possibilism: As the name suggests,

this explores the new ‘possibilities’ between humans
and their environment, despite certain environmen-
tal limitations. Through environmental possibilism,
we focus on development with the help of technol-
ogy, innovation, new energy explorations and so on.
Industrialization and urbanization became way of
life. This can be linked with anthropogenic activities
which are to be discussed later.
Thus, balancing of life was required in the form of
sustainable development which we will discuss later.
Right now we are discussing basic concepts of envi-
ronment in the following topics.

Ecology is the scientific study of interactions among
organisms and between organisms and their environ-
ment. Ecology examines how organisms adapt to their
environment, how they interact with other species, and
how they influence and are influenced by the non-living
environment. .

The scope of ecology covers the study of individual
organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems, and
the giobal scale of the biosphere. (Take note that ecosys-
tem is included here).

The concept of ‘ecology’ was coined by Ernst Haeckel, a
German biologist in 1869.

LEVELS oF ECOLOGY
Ecology can be understood at the following levels:
1. Individual Organism: Here, we study a single organ-

ism and its interactions with its environment. It’s
essential to see into where it lives (habitations), how

it adapts to its surroundings (adaptations), and th
potential threats it faces (safety). ?
For instance, let’s take the example of a frog, w,
can examine how it locates food sources, ensures it
safety, and employs protective adaptations in its hab;
tat. We can also investigate how it thrives in a mojg
environment to maintain skin moisture and repro
duces by laying eggs in the water. :

2. Species: A species is a group of similar individu,
organisms that are capable of interbreeding to pro
duce fertile offspring and share common characteris
tics. For example, different species of human beings
roses or trees. The name of species of human beings j
homo sapiens.

Species is a step above the individual organism. They take
us towards population. Their interactions take place a
the following levels:

1. Within species - population ecology

2. Between species - community ecology :

3. Between organisms and their physical environ.
ment - ecosystem ecology

Some Central Role Playing Species: We can discuss the
following:

Keystone Species: Keystone means holding everything
together. Keystone species plays a unique and crucial role.
in the functioning of an ecosystem.

° They are assumed to be essential for the health and
biodiversity of our planet’s ecosystems. They may be
less in number, but their impact on ecosystem is much.
bigger.

° By maintaining balance of nature, they also provide
essential services to other species. Without keystone
species, ecosystems would be much less diverse and
resilient.

° Keystone species function as predators as they con-.
trol the populations of other animals. They actually
function as mutualists for benefits of more than
one species or create or modify habitats for other
species.
For example, in the Sundarbans mangrove forest.
in India, the Indian elephant is a keystone species
because of its large impact on the environment.

° There is an excellent example: ‘Termites’, particu-.
larly in savanna or arid regions, construct large,
complex mounds from soil, saliva, and excrement.
These structures are essential for regulating the
colony’s temperature and humidity which are cru-
cial for survival. Additionally, termite mounds
improve soil quality and water infiltration, which
offer microhabitats for diverse species and thus.
enhancing biodiversity in their ecosystems.

Critical Link Species: This term is broader than that of
keystone species. This includes any species that plays 4
vital role in the functioning of an ecosystem. They play



=== Page 64 ===
al role in connecting different parts of an ecosystem.
may look at the following terms:

cosystem Engineers: They physically alter their
environment.

Foundation Species: They create and define entire
ecosystems, like coral in a coral reef.

Umbrella Species: Conservation of these species pro-
ects a wide range of other species.

ndicator Species: They indicate the health of an
cosystem.
Flagship Species: These are charismatic species used
s a symbol to stimulate conservation awareness and
ction.

emic Species: Endemic species are typically asso-
d with specific geographic regions and are found
rally only in those particular areas. Global exam-
is of endemic are Lion-tailed Macaque in Western
s, Nilgiri Tahr in Nilgiri range (both in India),
kapo (a flightless parrot) in New Zealand, Giant
nda in China are few examples which.are not natu-
ly found anywhere else in the world. Human beings
found almost everywhere and not an example of
demic species.

‘Population: This level deals with groups of the same
species, exploring their dynamics, interactions, and
coexistence in a particular habitat. The following
aspects are crucial for population specially for human
beings.

1. Reproduction and Natality: The production
of new individual organisms from their parents
through this biological process. Natality refers to
the birth rate, or the frequency of births within a
population.

Population Growth Rate: We need to factor
birth and death rates as well as immigration and
emigration.

Age Structure or Distribution with in popula-
tion: Pre-reproductive (too young to reproduce),
reproductive, and post-reproductive (beyond a
age).

Population Dispersal: This takes care of move-
ments - emigration (leaving a region), immigra-
tion (entering a region), and migration (seasonal
or periodic movemient).

Predation: In this interaction one organism, the
predator, kills and eats another organism, its prey.
Mortality: This is the death rate, indicating the
frequency of deaths within a population.
Carrying Capacity: The maximum number of
individuals of a particular species that a specific
environment can sustain indefinitely without
degrading the environment.

Metapopulations: Let’s take an example of deer.
Metapopulations include several deer populations
spread across different forests, connected by migrat-
ing individuals.

9.3

4. Community: This refers to all living things in an area,
how do the different species interact, influence each
other, and maintain the balance of the ecosystem.
Community talks about interdependence, competi-
tion (for space and resources) and disturbances (pol-
lution and intervention by other communities).

For example, in a pond, it is the interaction of frogs, fish,
insects, plants et. Community is an experience that tells
us how do different species interact. The fish might eat
some of the insects, controlling the insect population, and
thus benefits the plants.

Ecological Niche: We discussed some interactions.
Ecological niche refers to the specific role and position
that an organism or species occupies within an ecosystem.
The following aspects are important to us for niches:

Habitat: The area or natural environment in which an
organism or population normally lives is called a habitat.
A habitat is made up of two types of factors:

1. Physical factors such as soil, moisture, temperature
and light

2. Biotic factors such as availability of food and predators

Cohabitat: When organisms of different species live
together.

Microhabitat: When particular organism(s) live in a
small and specific part(s) of a habitat. A habitat is not
always a geographical area.

Example: Frogs are ectothermic as their temperature
is regulated by the environment. They prefer staying in
aquatic and moist terrestrial localities such as freshwa-
ters, wetlands, rainforests etc.

The habitat of human beings is incredibly diverse and
spans the entire planet.

e Resource Utilization: The types of food, shelter, and
other resources etc.

° Behavioural Patterns: This includes feeding habits,
reproduction strategies, routine life patterns.

e Interactions: This refers to relationships with other
species, that includes competition, predation, and
mutualism.

e Tolerance Limits: This refers to range of environ-
mental conditions such as temperature, humidity, pH
etc. that the organism can tolerate,

Ecological Footprint and its Measurement: Though
Earth is assumed like a mother, the give and take rela-
tionship is crucial for sustainability for present and future
generations. The ecological footprint measures how much
nature we use—like food, water, and energy. It checks
whether we use more than Earth can provide. Think of it
as nature’s balance sheet. We should aim to use only what
Earth can give us.

We can use the idea of measuring ecological footprint
for smail things, like how much water is used by a person,
or big things, like the energy used by a whole city, such as



=== Page 65 ===
9.4

Mumbai. We measure ecological footprint in ‘global hect-
ares’ (gha). One global hectare represents what Earth can
renew or regenerate in a year.’

Ecological succession: This is how some ecological (or
ecosystem) slowly change over the time. This happens at
two stages:

1. Primary succession: This begins in places without
life, like rocks, where simple organisms like lichens
start making soil. This allows more plants to grow later.

2. Secondary succession: During this succession, the
ecosystem evolves from simple to more complex com-
munities, eventually reaching a stable state.

Types of Ecology: From a study perspective, ecology has
two branches:

e Autecology: This is the study of ‘individual organ-
isms or a single species’ and their interactions with
the environment. It looks into the life cycle, behav-
iour, adaptations, and how these organisms or species
survive and thrive. This makes us understand the spe-
cific roles and impacts these organisms have within
their ecosystems.

¢ Synecology: This studies how ‘different species in a
community’ interact within their ecosystem. It looks
at how these groups live together, their roles, and
how energy and nutrients flow between them, which
is key for understanding the ecosystem’s overall
functioning.

Haute Ecology: This represents an entirely different per-
spective, Haute Ecology represents a more interdiscipli-
nary and applied approach, blending ecology with other
fields such as design, engineering, and architecture.

Figure 9.1 Main Aspects of Environment

The term ‘ecosystem’ was introduced by Arthur Tansley in
1935. It describes a self-regulating community where liv-
ing organisms interact with each other and their physical
environment. For example, in a pond ecosystem, various

plants, animals, and microorganisms coexist and int
within their specific aquatic environment.

Energy Flow: The Sun is the primary source of energy
most ecosystems. Sunlight is captured by producers, ]j
plants, through the process of photosynthesis.

The other components worth most discussing are:
follows:

erg

Biological Components (Biotic): This includes
the living things in the pond, such as plants, anima
(frogs, fish, insects), bacteria, and algae.

Physical Components (Abiotic): These are the ng
living parts of the ecosystem, such as water, sg
nutrients, sunlight, and temperature. :

Producers (Autotrophs): These are organisms, typ
cally plants and algae, make their own food using su
light, water, and carbon dioxide. They form the base
of the energy pyramid in an ecosystem. /

Consumers (Heterotrophs): These organisms can.
not produce their own food and must consume othe:
organisms. Consumers are divided into different
categories:
e Primary Consumers:
producers. a
* Secondary Consumers: Carnivores or omnivore
that eat primary consumers.
e Tertiary Consumers: Predators that eat second-
ary consumers.
Decomposers and Detritivores: These organism:
like fungi and bacteria, break down dead organisms
and waste materials, releasing nutrients back into
the environment. They play a crucial role in recycling
energy and matter within the ecosystem.
Energy Transfer: Energy is transferred between tro-
phic levels (producers, consumers, decomposers),
typically through consumption. However, during
each transfer, some energy is lost as heat due to met:
abolic processes, as described by the Second Law 0
Thermodynamics.

Energy Loss and 10% Energy Rule: The energy flow
is always uni-directional; it goes in one direction. The
concept of energy loss tells us about the essence 0
‘unidirectional’ (one way) energy flow in ecosystems.
Energy moves from one trophic level to another but
‘without any returning’. A significant portion of energy
is lost as heat during various biological processes like
digestion, metabolism, maintaining body temperature
etc. Thus, we need the continuous energy input, primal
ily from sunlight, to sustain the different trophic levels
in an ecosystem. The 10% Energy Rule also tells us that
only 10% of energy is transferred from one tropic levé
to another, and 90% is the ‘Energy Loss’. Include the
following definitions also, This can be understood bet
ter with the help of a diagram, refer figure 9.4.

We observe how the biotic and abiotic com-
ponents interact and function together as a
whole. There are diverse ecosystems, such as
forests, marine, and deserts, each with unique
characteristics. —

Ecosystems vary in size and composition but share
basic structural and functional characteristics.

systems.

All ecosystems, whether a large forest or a small

ulated to ensure stability and balance. :

Trophic Levels in an Aquatic System

1. Oligotrophic: Low in nutrients and hence low
biological productivity. They typically have
clear water with high oxygen levels, this support
species like trout. ;

Mesotrophic: Intermediate level of nutrients
and biological productivity. They support more
productivity.

. Eutrophic: Thy are high in nutrients, particularly
nitrogen and phosphorus, thus have high biologi-
cal productivity in terms of abundant plant and
algal growth. This leads to problems like algal |
blooms and low oxygen levels in deeper waters |
due to the decomposition of dead algae and plants.
Hypertrophic: These are extremely nutrient-rich |
water bodies, often suffering from severe prob-
lems like dense algal blooms, very low oxygen lev-
els in deeper waters, and poor water clarity.

. Dystrophic: These water bodies are rich in|
organic matter, often undecomposed, similar to |
those found in bogs and marshy lakes. They are |
not necessarily nutrient-rich in the traditional ||
sense (like nitrates and phosphates) but have {|
high levels of organic carbon.

This concept of Ecological Pyramid was developed by
Charles Elton in 1927. They are a simplified representa-
tion of a complex system. We already discussed producers
and consumers in the context, with producers at the bot-
tom and herbivores and carnivores at the top.

Figure 9.2 Energy Pyramid

The following three types of ecological pyramids are
interconnected.

1. Pyramid of Energy: This represents the flow of
energy through an ecosystem. Energy is transferred
from one trophic level to the next, but not all of it is
available for consumption at the next level. In fact,
only about 10% of the energy is transferred to the
next level, with the remaining 90% being lost as heat
or used in respiration.

We can again look at grass + deer— tiger. The energy
is lost at each trophic level.

2. Pyramid of Numbers: The pyramid of numbers rep-
resents the number of organisms at each trophic level.
The pyramid of numbers can be upright, inverted, or
partly upright. ;
Upright Pyramid: In a forest ecosystem, the trees are
the primary producers, and most numerous. There
are fewer herbivores, such as deer or rabbits, and even
fewer carnivores, such as wolves or bears.

Inverted Pyramid: In a marine or aquatic ecosys-
tem such as pond, the biomass of primary consumers
(zooplankton, the herbivores) can indeed be larger
than the biomass of primary producers (phytoplank-
ton, reproduce quickly).

3. Pyramid of Biomass: This represents the total mass
of organisms at each trophic level. The pyramid of
biomass is usually upright, but it can be inverted in
some cases,

We can take the example of grass, zebra and lion h
again. There is same example of inverted as Was
pyramid of numbers.

ized by their climate and vegetation. They are influence,

They are found all over the world, from the frozen Arctj,
tundra to the lush tropical rainforests.

Biomes regulate the Earth’s climate by absorbing cq
bon dioxide and releasing oxygen. They help in regulatin,

being, providing us with food, medicine, clean air an
water, and recreational opportunities. However, humai
activities like habitat destruction, pollution, and overus
of resources are causing a decline in many species. Th
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is also in th
syllabus, that is an international treaty adopted in 1992.

An ecotone is the transition zone or area between tw
biomes, ecosystems, or habitats, where there is often ;
high degree of biodiversity and species interaction. Thi
following concepts are important in ecotone.

1. Edge Effect: The edge effect in ecology refers to th
changes in population or community structures tha
occur at the boundary of two or more habitats. Area
where different habitats meet, such as forests and
grasslands, are known as ‘edges.’ This effect has sev
eral key aspects such as increased diversity at bound
aries, differential environment conditions, specie
interaction. The whole situation may be beneficial t
some, but detrimental for others.
Human activities often create artificial edges, suc
as those formed by agriculture, logging, or urba
development.

2. Habitat loss: This refers to the disappearance of nat
ural environments that are home to particular plants”
and animals. This may occur due to deforestation,
urbanization, agriculture expansion, climate change,
pollution etc.

3. Biodiversity Hotspots: Biodiversity hotspots are
areas of high ecological richness and diversity, often



=== Page 68 ===
found in ecotones, which are transition zones between
‘different ecosystems. These ecotones showcase a
greater variety of plant and animal life compared to
the neighbouring ecosystems. :
Fragmentation: Fragmentation turns a large, con-
tinuous natural area (like an ecotone) into smaller,
-_jsolated pieces due to human development activities.
This is harmful as it reduces the overall area where

ants and animals can live. Species that need large,
uninterrupted spaces may struggle or decline as they
Iss may not find mates for reproduction.

Atmosphere (Air)

The atmosphere is a mixture of gases surrounding the
Earth, primarily composed of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon
dioxide, argon, and other trace gases, along with water
vapor. It is divided into several layers, with distinct char-
acteristics:

TROPOSPHERE

e The altitude ranges from the Earth’s surface to about
8-14.5 km.

° In troposphere, all human activities and nearly all
weather phenomena take place. It contains the major-
ity of the atmosphere’s mass and is where we experi-
ence daily weather patterns.

e Importance also lies in the fact that troposphere holds
the air we breathe and the water vapor that forms
clouds and precipitation.

* Normal Lapse Rate: This is specific to tropo-
sphere, that reflects the decrease in temperature
with increase in altitude (height). This reduction is

with meteorology. :

Altitude: This extends from above the troposphere up
to about 50 km high. :
Atmospheric Pressure: This layer is about 1/1000th
of the pressure at sea level.
Ozone Layer: This layer lies within stratosphere
that is located roughly between 15 and 35 km above
Earth. This layer acts as a protective shield against the
sun’s harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, preventing most
of them from reaching the Earth’s surface. Thus, it
protects the life on earth.
The most harmful UV-C is almost completely
absorbed by the ozone layer, UV-B is also harmful but
is absorbed less.
Otherwise, exposure to high level of UV radiations
can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and damage to the
DNA of living cells.

DEFINITION OF FORESTS

Forests are large areas dominated by trees. They play a
crucial role in the Earth’s ecosystem, providing habitat for
a multitude of species, influencing climate patterns, and
serving as significant carbon sinks.

’

FORESTS AS A RESOURCE

e Biodiversity: Forests are caste and cradle to biodi-
versity, they are rich in it. They function as ‘terrestrial
lungs’ of the earth, they regulate climate and main-
taining air quality. they house a vast array of flora and
fauna, including several endangered species. National
Parks, Wild Sanctuary Parks, Biosphere reserves are
required to conserve biodiversity.

e Economic Value: They contribute to the economy
through timber, non-timber forest products (like
medicinal plants and bamboo), and ecotourism.

e Environmental Importance: Forests in India play a
vital role in water conservation, soil preservation, and
climate regulation.

Facts Asout Forests IN INDIA

¢ India has tropical evergreens, deciduous forests,
thorn forests, and mangroves. The Western Ghats, the
Eastern Himalayas, and the Northeastern region are
some of the most forest-rich areas.
India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2021:

«. The ISFR 2021 shows an increase of 0.28% in for-
est and tree cover, with a slight increase of 0.22%

in forest cover and 0.76% in tree cover compared jg
the previous report. The total forest and tree COvey
of India are now 80.9 million hectares, which js an
increase of 2,261 square kilometers from 2019.
¢ The increase in forest and tree cover is largely dug
to plantations and assisted natural regeneration
Plantations account for 47% of the increase, whjje
assisted natural regeneration accounts for 39%.
° Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh
are the three leading states in forest coverage; the
together account for almost half of India’s forest ang
tree cover.
e The three states with the highest percentage of forest
and tree cover are Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and
Manipur. The forest cover percentage is more than
75%.
e India’s forest and tree cover is still below the global
average.

DEFORESTATION

Deforestation is the extensive removal of Earth’s forests,
leading to land degradation. At the current rate of defor- |
estation, the world’s precious rainforests are predicted to |
disappear within a century. The primary drivers of defor-
estation include:

1. Agriculture Expansion: Agriculture, including sub-
sistence and commercial farming, is the leading cause
of deforestation, responsible for 85% of forest loss.

2. Shifting Cultivation: This practice, seen in regions
like Assam and Madagascar, involves clearing small
patches of tropical forests for crops. They lead to a
pattern of unsustainable land use practices. This often
occurs in tropical regions with fertile soils.

3. Timber Harvesting: The logging for wood and
paper products contributes to 14% of deforestation.
Countries like Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil,
Argentina, and various African nations are prominent _
examples. :

4. Hill Slope Cultivation: Terrace farming, known as
contour farming, involves farming on narrow steps _
cut across hillsides. This practice can lead to soil
erosion.

5. Wildfires: These are influenced by human and nat-
ural factors. Climate change has increased the fre-
quency and intensity of wildfires. Australia, Canada
can be taken as the best examples. :

Negative Effects of Deforestation

Deforestation has significant environmental conse-
quences:

1. Climate Change: Deforestation results in less carbon
dioxide absorption, leading to increased Green House.
Gas emissions and global warming.

2. Water Cycle Disruption: Trees contribute to the
water cycle by returning water vapor to ‘the atmo-
sphere. Deforestation decreases precipitation, impact-
ing water availability.


=== Page 72 ===
soil Erosion: Tree roots stabilize soil, preventing ero-
sion and landslides. Deforestation raises the risk of
Jandslides and flash floods.

pesertification: Excessive tree removal contributes
to desertification, particularly in drylands. This leads
to land degradation and threatens ecosystems.
piodiversity Loss: Deforestation reduces habitat for
countless species, contributing to biodiversity loss.

EARTHQUAKES

An earthquake is a sudden shaking of the Earth’s crust,
often with no warning, making prediction nearly impossi-
ble. Seismology is the scientific study of earthquakes and
the seismic waves they generate.

Causes of Earthquakes

e The Earth’s crust consists of plates, and the theory of
plate tectonics explains that stress occurs when these
plates interact. We can see the following concept:

° Pangaea Breakup: Pangaea is a supercontinent that
existed about 200 million years ago. This breakup led
to the formation of the continents as we know them
today. India is an example of that. The Himalayas
formed as a result of this collision between the Indian
and Eurasian tectonic plates. That process is still con-
tinuing, Himalayas rise a few centimetres every year,
and earthquakes do happen.

e Plates pull apart, push against each other, or slide
sideways, creating stress along plate boundaries
known as faults. :

e When stress ona fault reaches a breaking point, it results
in a fault rupture and the release of seismic waves, radi-
ating from an underground point known as the focus.

Types of Seismic Waves

e There are two main types of seismic. waves: body
waves and surface waves.

e Body waves: These travel through the Earth’s inte-
rior and include primary (P) waves and secondary (S)
waves.

° P waves are faster and typically the first to reach
seismograph stations. . :

e Surface waves: These move along the Earth’s crust,
shaking it both horizontally and vertically.

e Love waves (named after A.E.H. Love, a British
mathematician) cause horizontal motion, mov-
ing the ground from side to side. They occur as a

- result of an earthquake. They propagate outward
from the earthquake’s epicenter.

* Rayleigh waves (named after Lord Rayleigh, the
British physicist) produce vertical and side-to-
side motion, which can damage buildings and
infrastructure.

Measuring Earthquake Intensity

Richter Scale: They measure the magnitude of an earth-
quake, essentially quantifying the amount of energy it
releases. A higher magnitude indicates a more powerful
earthquake with stronger shaking. Their measurement
is logarithmic in nature and theoretically they start from
zero and goes to any level. It is not considered valid for
earthquakes with magnitudes below 3.0 or above 7.0 as
the scale gets saturated beyond a level.

° Seismograph: This device records the vibrations of

the ground during an earthquake. This data is then

. used to calculate the earthquake’ $ magnitude on the
Richter Scale.

° Magnitude and Energy Release: Each whole num},
increase on the Richter Scale (e.g., from 6.5 to 7
indicates a tenfold increase in the shaking amplitud

_ (ground motions) and approximately 30-32 (31.6 i

_ be more precise) times more energy release.

The Classification of intensification of
Earthquakes

1. Micro earthquakes: Less than 2.0 magnitude - 'T
are very small, they are typically not felt by humans

2. Minor earthquakes: 2.0-3.9 magnitude - They are
often felt as a trembling or shaking sensation, but
they rarely cause damage.

3. Major earthquakes: 4.0-5.9 magnitude - They can
cause moderate damage to buildings and infrastruc.
ture, especially if they occur in densely Populated
areas.

4. Great earthquakes: 6.0-6.9 magnitude - They are
capable of causing significant damage and wide.
spread destruction.

5. Higher earthquakes: 7.0 magnitude and above.
They are the most powerful earthquakes, capable
of causing catastrophic damage and widespread
destruction over large areas.

hey

A Shift Towards Moment Magnitude Scale (MM Scale):
MM more accurately measure the energy of larger earth-
quakes and is more universally applicable globally.

The MM Scale is a seismic scale used for measuring the
intensity of an earthquake. Unlike scales that measure
the energy or magnitude of an earthquake, the MM Scale
assesses the effects and damage caused by the earthquake.
It isa descriptive scale, using Roman numerals from I to
XII to denote increasing levels of damage and impact:

1. I (Not felt): Barely noticeable, if at all.

2. XII (Extreme): Total destruction — objects thrown
into the air, landscapes changed.

Seismic Zones in India

© India is divided into four seismic zones: Zone II, Ill, [V,
and V, with Zone V being the most seismically active
and Zone II the least.

° Zone V includes northeastern India, parts of Jammu
and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and more.

° Zone IV covers remaining parts of Jammu and.
Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, and other regions.

e Zone Il includes Kerala, Goa, parts of northern |
states, and more.

¢ Zone Il encompasses the rest of the country.

EARTHQUAKE MiiriGATION Practices

Effective earthquake mitigation requires a compre-_
hensive and integrated approach, combining robust
construction practices, informed public preparedness,
cutting- -edge engineering, and advanced technology for
early warnings.

pureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Guidelines:
se are guidelines for constructing buildings that
an resist seismic forces. The focus is on using mate-
d designs that can absorb and dissipate seis-
thereby reducing the damage during an
unicipality Checks: This ensures the adherence to
uidelines. There is rigorous scrutiny of architectural
designs, structural plans, and construction materials
to ensure safety standards are met.

blic Education on Earthquakes

nderstanding Earthquakes: This entails explain-
ing seismic waves, fault lines, and how tectonic move-
_ments cause tremors. It makes people understand why
certain regions are more prone to seismic activities.
preparedness Measures: Teaching practical skills
like ‘Drop, Cover, and Hold On’, how to create an
emergency kit, and evacuation routes.

gineered Structures

Design and Construction: To follow seismic design
principles, like flexibility in structures, appropriate
load distribution, and using materials that can with-
stand vibrations.

Architectural and Engineering Integration:
Architects and engineers must collaborate to incor-
porate aesthetic elements without compromising the
building’s seismic resilience.

Soil Analysis: Before construction, it’s vital to assess
the soil’s ability to support a structure during an
earthquake. Soil types like clay or sand can amplify
seismic waves, thus requiring specialized foundation
techniques.

arly Warning Systems

Seismic Monitoring: Advanced technologies like
seismographs, GPS, and accelerometers are used
to detect the slightest ground movements. These
systems can provide crucial seconds to minutes of
warning, allowing people and systems to initiate pre-
defined safety protocols.

Public Alert Systems: These can range from mobile
alerts, sirens, to broadcast systems, ensuring timely
and widespread dissemination of warnings to all seg-
ments of the population.

SUNAMIS

he term ‘tsunami? originates from the Japanese words
Tsu,’ -meaning harbour, and ‘nami, meaning waves.
stinamis are a series of ocean waves characterized by
ery long wavelengths, often spanning hundreds of kms.
hey are typically caused by significant disturbances in
_the ocean, including:

1. Earthquakes ~ primarily cause of earthquakes.
2. Landslides
3. Voleanic eruptions

4. Explosions
5. Meteorite impacts

° These disturbances can occur beneath the ocean’s
surface (e.g., underwater earthquakes or submarine
landslides) or from above (e.g., meteorite impacts).

e Tsunamis have a large wave height, long wave period
and high velocity.. Tsunamis can have wavelengths
ranging from 10 to 500 kms, with wave periods of up
to an hour. Due to their long wavelengths, tsunamis
behave as shallow-water waves.

* When tsunamis approach the shore, they can reach
significant vertical heights, often referred to as ‘run-
up heights. The depth of the ocean is the primary fac-
tor determining the height of a tsunami wave when it
reaches the shore.

e As tsunamis approach shallow coastal waters, their
speed increases, while their wavelength decreases.

© Tsunamis can travel across the open ocean at approxi-
mately 100 kms per hour. A series of waves that make
up a tsunami is called a ‘tsunami train.’

e Tsunamis have the potential to cause massive destruc-
tion upon reaching the coastline, leading to coastal
erosion, vegetation loss, and limited warning time for
coastal residents.

° Pacific Ocean is the main source of tsunamis. North
America is also at a higher risk for tsunamis due to its
location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.

° Coastal regions often have a ‘tsunami warning system’ .
to monitor and provide alerts. Unusually calm and
receding ocean water can serve as an early warning
sign of an impending tsunami.

9.1 magnitude quake near Sumatra, led to over 230,000

deaths and widespread destruction across 14 countries.

CYCLONES

Cyclones are regions of low atmospheric pressure sur-
rounded by high-pressure systems, resulting in swirling
atmospheric disturbances with powerful winds. General
features of a typical cyclone:



=== Page 75 ===
1. Strong winds: Cyclone winds can reach speeds of up
to 252 km/h (157 mph).

2. Exceptional rain: Cyclones can produce heavy rain-
fall, which can lead to flooding.

3. Storm surge: Storm surge is a sudden rise in sea level
caused by a cyclone. It can inundate coastal areas and
cause extensive damage.

* In the northern hemisphere, cyclonic winds rotate
counterclockwise, while in the southern hemisphere,
they rotate clockwise.

* Cyclones are primarily observed in tropical and tem-
perate regions worldwide.

Nomenclature of Cyclones: They are known by different
names across the world.

| Nomenclature _ Countries

Tropical Cyclones

South America

Tornadoes

In India, cyclones are moderate in nature, with the
state of Odisha being particularly vulnerable.

Damage Caused by Cyclones

¢ Cyclones are categorized into five levels, with
Category 5 being the most severe, featuring extremely
high wind speeds up to 252 kms per hour. |

e Cyclones can cause widespread damage to infrastruc-
ture and buildings.

¢ They can also lead to flooding, landslides, and power
outages.

e Cyclones can also cause outbreaks of diseases such as
malaria and diarrhea.

Cyclone Mitigation Measures

¢ Green belt plantation: Planting trees and shrubs along
the coast can help to reduce the impact of cyclones by
weakening the wind and absorbing rainwater.

° Early warning systems: Early warning systems can
help to alert people to the impending arrival of a
cyclone and give them time to evacuate to safety.

e Cyclone shelters: Cyclone shelters can provide safe
refuge for people who cannot evacuate their homes.

The Naming of Cyclones
The cyclones are named by the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO), a part of UN.

WMO has six regional specialized meteorological centres
(RSMCs) for naming cyclones in their respective regions. The
RSMC for India is the IMD (India Meteorological Department)
which maintains 169 names. The names are suggested by the
13 member countries of the WMO/ Economic and Social
Coramission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Panel on
Tropical Cyclones. The names are chosen to be familiar and
easily recognizable to the people in the region.

The names of cyclones-in India in 2023 were Agn
Akash, Bijli, Onil, Ogni, Nisha, Giri, Varun, Murasy and
Aag. The cyclones ‘Neer’, ‘Prabha’, and ‘Ghurni’ are the
names for cyclones that are expected to form in 2024,

The major cyclones in India were:

Jawad Yaas

Main Factors for Bay of Bengal Facing More Cyclones
than Arabian Sea :

=

The shape of the Bay of Bengal is a relatively shallow
embayment with a wide continental shelf. This shape
makes it more susceptible to the formation of strong
cyclonic circulations. The Arabian Sea is a deeper ang
more elongated sea that is less conducive to the for.
mation of cyclones.

The Bay of Bengal has warmer Sea Surface Temperature
(SST) than the Arabian Sea. Warm SSTs are a neces.
sary condition for the formation of cyclones, as they
provide the energy needed for cyclones to develop and
intensify.

3. Moreover, the Bay of Bengal has lower vertical wind
shear than the Arabian Sea, which makes it more
favorable for the formation of cyclones.

Volcanoes

Volcanoes are openings or ruptures in the Earth’s surface
or crust. They are typically associated with the release of
extremely hot gases, ash, sulphur, steam, and other mat
rials during eruptions, known as pyroclastic flows. Thes
flows can reach speeds of more than 700 kms per hour
and can be highly destructive.

Volcanoes are often found in regions where tecton
plates either converge (collide) or diverge (move apart).
Subduction zones, where an oceanic plate sinks beneath a
continental plate, are common locations for volcanic activ-
ity. Volcanoes also exist along the edges of tectonic plates,
such as the ‘Ring of Fire’ encircling the Pacific Ocean.

ods are high water levels that inundate land that is not
sually submerged. There are three main types of floods:
jash floods, riverine floods, and urban floods.

lash Floods

‘lash floods are rapid inland floods caused by intense

infall. They can occur in sloped or flat terrains, but they

gre most common in sloped terrains where the water
ows rapidly with high destructive potential. Flash floods

can occur virtually anywhere, even in areas that are not

typically prone to flooding.

Causes of Flash Floods

Heavy rainfall in a short span of time: Flash floods
are typically associated with thunderstorms, which can
produce very heavy rainfall in a short amount of time.
Heavy siltation of the river bed: Siltation is the buildup
of sediment in the river bed. Heavy siltation can reduce
the water-carrying capacity of rivers and streams, mak-
ing them more likely to overflow during heavy rainfall.
Blockage in the drains: Blockages in drains can also
lead to flash flooding, as the water cannot drain away
quickly enough. Blockages can be caused by debris,
leaves, or even animals.

Landslides blocking the flow of the stream:

Landslides can block the flow of streams, causing

water to back up and flood the surrounding area.

Construction of dams and reservoirs: Dams and

reservoirs can help to control flooding, but they can

also increase the risk of flash flooding if they are not
properly managed.

° Strong winds accompanied by heavy downpour
along with storm surge in areas prone to cyclones:
Cyclones can produce strong winds and heavy rainfall,
which can lead to flash flooding. Storm surge, which is
a wall of water that is pushed up the coast by a cyclone,
can also contribute to flash flooding in coastal areas.

» Catabatic Winds: Winds that flow downhill, usually at
night when the air cools and becomes denser. They can
push warm, moist air up slopes, leading to cloud forma-
tion and heavy rain, potentially causing flash floods.

° Anabatic Winds: Winds that flow uphill, typically
_ during the day when the ground heats up, making
the air less dense. These winds can break up clouds,
reducing the likelihood of flash flooding.

CLouDBURST

® Cloudburst is an intense, brief rainfall event with hail
and thunder, causing flash floods and landslides.

e It lasts only a few minutes but can bring a massive
amount of rain.

e Cloudbursts are unpredictable and can lead to severe
weather events, like the 2013 disaster in Uttarakhand,
India, causing loss of life.

DROUGHT

Drought is when there’s not enough rain for a long time,
causing problems like water shortages, failed crops, and
distress. Even places with lots of rain, like Kerala, can
experience drought when there’s an imbalance between
water supply and demand.

There are four primary types of droughts:

1. Meteorological Drought: Characterized by less rain-
fall than usual, resulting in prolonged periods of sun
and heat..

2. Hydrological Drought: Happens when water bodies
like rivers and groundwater are reduced, leading to a
shortage of water.

3. Agricultural Drought: Occurs when soil moisture is
too low for crops to grow properly, potentially leading
to food shortages.

4, Socioeconomic Drought: A situation where water
scarcity impacts the economy and society, affecting
food, water availability, and jobs.

Artificial Rain

Cloud seeding is important for reducing droughts, help-
ing agriculture, managing forest fires, and cutting air pol-
lution. It involves spreading materials like silver iodide
or dry ice in clouds to cause rain. Drones and aircraft are
used for this. Nations such as China, UAE, and the USA
widely use cloud seeding for different environmental
needs, showing its global importance.

LANDSLIDES

Landslides are the downward and outward movement of
slope-forming materials, such as rocks, soils, and artificial

fills, along surfaces of separation. They can be slow or fast,

and can occur in a variety of settings, including moun-
tainous terrains, areas with steep slopes, and areas where
human activities have disturbed the natural landscape.

Causes of Landslides
Landslides are influenced by several factors:

° Geological Factors: Weakness in slope materials like
soil or rock increases landslide risk.

e Erosion: Caused by rainfall, wind, or human activi-
ties like deforestation, erosion makes slopes more
prone to landslides. oo

° Heavy Rainfall: This can saturate and increase the

weight of slope materials, triggering landslides on
steep terrain.

e Human Activities: Mining, deforestation, irrigation,
and construction can destabilize slopes.

e Earthquakes: These can induce landslides by shak-
ing and loosening ground materials.



=== Page 77 ===
$.16

* Volcanic Eruptions: These can create debris flows, a
landslide type involving fast-moving water, rock, and
mud.

Landslides can lead to loss of life, property damage, and
environmental impacts. Mitigation includes careful land
use, soil stabilization, and proper drainage management.

Wildfires

A wildfire refers to an uncontrolled fire that ignites in
combustible vegetation in rural or wilderness areas. What
sets wildfires apart from other types of fires is their exten-
sive size and rapid spread far beyond the initial source.
Additionally, wildfires are unpredictable, capable of
changing direction suddenly and leaping over natural or
man-made barriers like roads, rivers, and firebreaks.

Nationa Disaster Manacement Act or 2005
~ NDMA

NDMA of 2005 in India designates the Ministry of Home
Affairs as the primary coordinator for disaster manage-
ment. Key decision-making bodies include the Cabinet
Committee on Security (CCS), with the Prime Minister as a
member, and the National Crisis Management Committee
(NCMC). NDMA plays a crucial role in developing disaster
management plans and overseeing their implementation
at the national level.

Figure 9.12

National Disaster Management

The 2001 High Power Committee on Disaster Management
proposed a tiered approach for managing disasters:

1. Level LO: This is a period of normalcy, focusing on
reducing disaster risk.

2. Level L1: Refers to disasters manageable at the dis-
trict level, with state authorities on standby to assist if
necessary.

3. Level L2: Involves disasters requiring state-level
intervention and resources, with central agencies
ready for immediate deployment if needed.

4. Level L3: Indicates large-scale or catastrophic events
that surpass district and state capabilities, necessitat-
ing central intervention.

The NDMA and other central government agencies pla
supporting role at Level L1 and L2 disasters. At Leve| L
disasters, the central government takes the lead in Coord;

HDI AND ITs PARAMETERS
Human Development Index (HDI) was developed by the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in the
1990s. HDI measures countries’ levels of social and eco-
nomic development.

HDI ranks countries on a scale from 0 to 1.0 based on
health, education, and income. HDI is calculated using
three main indicators, see figure 9.13.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES IN SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT

This historical perspective is crucial for setting MDGs
and SDGs over a period of time, how do our governments
get motivated to set their right policies for the welfare of
people.

1. Thomas Robert Malthus (1798): Malthus said that
if we have too many people and not enough resources
like food and space, it can cause problems. He talked
about two ways to control the population: by choos-
ing when to have children or by things like famine,
disease, or wars.

2. Garrett James Hardin (1968): Hardin talked about

a problem called the ‘Tragedy of the Commons.’ It

means if everyone uses something like land or water

without thinking about the future, it can harm the
environment.

Club of Rome: This is a global think tank to ensure that

world is a better place to live, people get what they need

4. UN Conference on the Human Environment
(1972): This conference is also known as Stockholm
Conference. This proved to be a turning point an
laid the groundwork for future environmental agree- -
ments and discussions on sustainable development. _
5. Brundtland Commission (1983): Sustainable
development was defined in the 1987 ‘Our Common
Future’ report. It means that meeting today’s need
without harming future generations’ ability to meet
theirs. It stresses balancing economic, social, an
environmental goals. :
6. Agenda 21 in Rio Earth Summit (1992): This approach |
envisioned the world’s future, emphasizing shared respon _
sibilities to address climate change and global warming. It _
led to creating the UN Framework Convention on Climate.
Change (UNFCCC), crucial in global climate negotiations.



=== Page 80 ===
/ Millennium Development Goals (MDGs - 2000):
_ The countries set some goals such as in health, educa-
tion, and reducing poverty.

, UN Conference on Sustainable Development
_ (Rio+20) (2012): The Rio+20 conference was held
20 years after the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. It adopted
the motto ‘The Future We Want.’ It reviewed progress,
and focused the need for inclusivity and participation.
This laid the groundwork for the SDGs in 2015.
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): After
2015, countries agreed on new goals to make the
_-world better by 2030. These goals are about things

- care of our planet.

iLLENIUM DeveLopment Goats (MDGS)
DGs were set up in September 2000.

These MDGs consisted of eight goals for a target
' achievement year of 2015.

These goals focused on combating poverty, hunger,
disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation, and
discrimination against women.

The MDGs emphasized human capital, infrastructure,
and human rights to improve living standards.

e Eight MDGs were:

. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.

. Achieve universal primary education.

Promote gender equality and empower women.
4. Reduce child mortality.

5. Improve maternal health.

6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.
Ensure environmental sustainability.

Develop a global partnership for development.

A Shift from MDGs To SDGs

The shift represents a significant evolution in global devel-
opment objectives. Key differentiating points include:

. Zero Goals: Unlike MDGs which aimed for halfway
targets, SDGs aim for complete eradication, e.g., zero
hunger, zero preventable child deaths.

Universal Goals: SDGs apply universally to all coun-
tries, addressing inequalities within and among coun-
tries, unlike the MDGs’ donor-recipient approach.
Comprehensive and Inclusive: SDGs are more inclu-
sive, covering broader areas like gender and people’s
participation, and they segregate goals like hunger
and poverty, which were combined in MDGs.
Funding: SDGs emphasize sustainability and inclu-
sive economic development for self-reliance, mov-
ing away from MDGs’ reliance on aid from developed
countries.

Peace Building: SDGs include peace as a crucial
goal for societal prosperity, which was not a focus in
MDGs.

» Data Revolution: SDGs have enhanced focus on
monitoring, evaluation, and accountability across
various demographics.

sal primary education, SDGs aim for quality educa-
tion at all levels with improved indicators,

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

SDGs are a set of 17 interconnected goals adopted by the
United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development. These goals are a universal call
to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that
all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. Each goal
has specific targets to be achieved over the next 15 years.

India’s Approach to Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs): We are guided by the following principles:

¢ Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (Whole World is One
Family): India’s philosophy emphasizes inclusivity
and collaboration in achieving the SDGs.

Energy is the ability to do work or cause change. It’s fun-
damental in nature.

For examples, radiant energy from the sun warms
Earth. Cars use mechanical energy from fuel. We use elec-
trical energy to charge phones.

1. Conservation Law: Energy can’t be created or
destroyed, only changed in form. This is key to under-
standing energy dynamics.

2. Energy in Society: Essential for food and water secu-
rity, development, and climate adaptation. The pro-
duction and use may become part of anthropogenic
activities.

3. Shift to Renewables: Moving from natural to human-
driven conditions requires more renewable energy.

IpeEAL EnerGy Source CHARACTERISTICS

® Optimal heat production per unit volume/mass

° Easy transportation

* Minimal pollution

° Cost-effectiveness

* Energy, the ability to do work, is fundamental for liv-
ing beings, machinery, and all forms of matter. The
progress of civilization hinges on the availability and
use of energy.

* Energy exists in various forms, each serving differ-
ent purposes and evolving over time to meet human
needs.

Common Forms or ENERGY
1. Mechanical Energy:

Kinetic Energy (KE): This is the energy that an object
possesses due to its motion. For example, a moving
car or a rolling ball has kinetic energy because of its
movement.

Potential Energy (PE): This energy type relates to an
object’s position or state. Examples are compressed
springs, a book lying on the table, and water in the
dam. The stored energy in a compressed spring or an
elevated object (such as water in dams) can be con-
verted into kinetic energy when released, as in the
case of a falling book or energy production through
dams. This energy is known as PE.

Law of Conservation of Energy:

e Energy remains constant in the universe, trans-
forming from one form to another. This is exem-
plified by the conversion of potential energy to
kinetic energy in hydroelectric dams.

¢ Besides transformation, the energy balance is
important.

Thermal Energy: This is related to the temperature of
a substance, arising from the movement of molecules.
Chemical Energy: We can take an example of coal
that is a fossil fuel. It has been discussed separately.
Nuclear Energy: When nuclear mass is converted
into thermal energy.

InDIA’s Enercy LANDSCAPE

° The Electricity Act of 2003 was aimed at introducing
competition, safeguarding consumer interests, and
ensuring power for all.

® India’s energy sector is diverse, with contributions
from central, state, and private sectors.

® India is the third-largest electricity producer and sec-
ond-largest consumer globally.

® India uses a diverse energy mix in the following forms:

ENERGY CLASSIFICATION

° Primary Energy: Natural sources like coal and sun-
light. This can be renewable (like sunlight) or non-
renewable (like coal).

¢ Secondary Energy: Converted forms like electricity,
suitable for consumption in homes and industries.

Fossil Fuels

Fossil Fuels are Non-Renewable Fuels. The main type of
non-renewable energy, formed from decayed plants and
animals over millions of years. They are Limited in quan-
tity and diminish with use. The main examples are coal,
oil, and natural gas. They are mostly used in transporta-
tion and energy sectors.

Advantages: _
* High energy yield per unit
© Established technology for use
® Developed trading market

Disadvantages:
* Contribute to global warming.
¢ Health issues due to pollutants like sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxides.
® Oil spills harming marine ecosystems.

However, since uranium, the fuel for nuclear power |
finite, nuclear energy is considered a non-renewahy
resource.

Types of Enercy

These shift from one type of energy to other have no
taken place in an abrupt manner but were gradual.

¢ During the Stone Age, wood was the main source of
energy.

° As societies advanced, coal became the dominan,
energy source in the Iron Age.

° In modern times, we primarily use petroleum ang
natural gas as our main energy sources. on

° Now we look at the energy sector shift from non
renewable energy towards renewable energy.

Non-Renewable Energy

Non-renewable energy sources are finite resources that
cannot be replenished in a short time frame. They include.
fossil fuels and nuclear energy.

Benefits:
° Reliability: Provide a constant, reliable power source.

° Infrastructure: Existing extensive infrastructure for
extraction, processing, and distribution.

° High Energy Density: Offer high energy output for
industrial and commercial use.

Examples: Coal, Oil, Natural Gas, Nuclear Energy

Renewable Energy

These energy sources are those that can be naturally
replenished over a short period. They are considered sus-
tainable and endless.

Benefits:

° Environmental: Lower greenhouse gas emissions,

reduced pollution.

° Economic: Job creation in green technologies, poten-

tial for lower energy costs in the long term.

° Energy Security: Reduced dependence on imported
fuels.

Examples: Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Hydropower,
Biomass, Geothermal etc.

Shift in Government Approach Towards Renewable.
Energy: This shift has happened due to following rea-
sons:

1. International Commitments: The government
has made international commitments in the form
of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions
CINDCs), Glasgow commitments, Kyoto Protocol,
Paris agreement and so on (discussed later).

2. Regulate Emissions: We can take example Supreme
Court emission norms on festivals, vehicles etc.



=== Page 84 ===
pevelop Transition Policies: There is a transition
from non renewable towards renewable policy norms.
The Government has implemented Bharat Norms also.
Redirect Subsidies and Incentives: This helps in
‘making renewable products competitive and finan-
cially viable. There are less or no taxes on electrical
‘cars in India.

promote Renewable Energy Use: Through incen-
tives for solar, wind, hydro, and other renewable
energy installations.

Set Renewable Energy Targets: Establish ambitious
targets for renewable energy capacity to ensure a
significant portion of energy comes from renewable
sources.

Support International Collaboration: Participate
in international efforts and collaborations for tech-
nology transfer and funding in renewable energy
projects.

e Coal is created from ancient plant decay, is a major
energy source.

Coal contains chemical energy in carbon compounds.
The burning of coal releases energy as carbon dioxide
and water vapor.
In power plants, this heat turns water into steam,
driving turbines for electricity.

Energy conversion in coal usage involves changing
chemical energy to thermal, then to mechanical, and
finally into electrical energy.

eat: Peat is an early stage of coal formation. The car-
on contents are 50-60%. In transformation, under heat
nd pressure, it evolves into lignite, bituminous coal, and
nally anthracite.

ignite (Brown Coal): The carbon content is 70%. This
the lowest rank of coal with high moisture content. This
often used in electricity generation.

ituminous Coal (Soft Coal): The carbon content is
bout 80%. The usage is common in both power genera-
on and industrial applications. The Coke Production
appens by heating at high temperatures for steel produc-
on.

bon content, few impurities) that is required by the
steel industry.

® India also imports high-grade thermal coal which has
a higher calorific value and is more efficient for power
generation.

© The other factors are demand supply gaps, cost effec-
tiveness and logistics.

° India’s main coal deposits are in the Gondwana
region, specifically the Damodar Valley.

Burning too much coal leads to air pollution, health
problems, and climate change. Despite being a crucial
energy source in countries like China, India, the USA,
Australia, and Indonesia, it is a major cause of pollution
and global warming.

Coal Bed Methane (CBM)

CBM is a natural gas, found in coal seams, released during
coal mining.

1. Cleaner but Less Dense: CBM burns cleaner than
coal but has lower energy density.

2. More CBM for Power: Needs more volume to pro-
duce the same electricity as coal.

3. India’s Potential: India’s large coal reserves present
significant CBM opportunities. India is 5th largest
producer of coal. CBM could help India cut down on
oil and gas imports and greenhouse gas emissions.

4. Environmental Challenges: Extraction of CBM cre-
ates issues like wastewater production and methane
leaks. These environmental risks require effective
management and mitigation strategies.

Petroleum Oil

Petroleum, found as crude oil in earth’s rock formations,
is a mixture of hydrocarbons processed by fractional dis-
tillation in refineries. Its extraction, refining, and burning
release significant greenhouse gases, making it a major
climate change contributor.

Natura. Gas

° Natural gas is a fossil fuel, this is notable for its high
calorific value. It is the cleanest-burning fossil fuel.

° Natural Gas originates from organic materials such as
plants and animals transformed by heat and pressure
over millions of years. This co-exists with oil and coal
in the Earth’s crust.

The composition of Natural Gas is given as follows:

° Primarily composed of methane (CH,), typically 70-90%.

e Natural Gas contains other gases like ethane, pro-
pane, butane, and traces of nitrogen, carbon dioxide,
and hydrogen sulphide.

° Natural gas is extracted from underground reservoirs,
commonly found alongside oil deposits.

© Uses of Natural Gas: It’s widely used for power gen-
eration, industrial and residential heating (especially
in Europe, Russia, USA, Canada), and as compressed
natural gas (CNG) for vehicles.



=== Page 85 ===
° Petrochemical Production: Natural gas is also a
key ingredient in producing plastics, fertilizers, and
pharmaceuticals.

Natural Gas Hydrates

* Found in ocean beds (deep ocean sediments) and
polar regions (permafrost regions), these ice-like
structures combine natural gas (mainly methane)
and water.

* These hydrates have the potential to be a major source
of energy in the future, but they are difficult and
expensive to extract.

® In India, significant hydrate resources are estimated,
especially in Western, Eastern, and Andaman offshore
areas.

Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Piped Natural
Gas (PNG)

° CNG is natural gas that has been compressed to a high
pressure so that it can be stored in a tank and used as
a vehicle fuel.

* CNG is cleaner than diesel and petrol, with lower
emissions.

* CNG has a higher octane rating.

* CNG is noted for being lighter, having a narrow igni-
tion range, and being more cost-effective compared to
conventional fuels.

° PNG is the same gas supplied to households and -

industries for cooking and other purposes.

* Both CNG and PNG primarily consist of methane
and have a compact molecular structure that reduces
ozone formation in the troposphere.

Suace Gas

Shale Gas is a natural gas found in fine-grained shale
rock formations. Shale rocks contain significant petro-
leum and natural gas reserves.

1. Technological Advancements: Recent develop-
ments, especially horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing (fracking), have made extraction feasible.

2. Horizontal Drilling: Involves creating long horizon-
tal boreholes in shale layers.

3. Hydraulic Fracturing: High-pressure fluids break
the rock to release trapped gas.

4. Industry Impact: These technologies have signifi-
cantly boosted the natural gas industry, notably in
USA which has become net energy exporter courtesy
shale gas.

BioGAs

Biogas is produced through the introduction of bacterial
action in digesters containing human and animal sewage,
including animal dung. The decomposition process yields
methane, a valuable fuel used for cooking and power gen-
eration. The residual matter, known as slurry, serves as
nutrient-rich manure for agricultural fields.

The normal biogas composition is given below:

* Primarily composed of methane, but typically
50-70% if compared with Natural Gas.

° Contains a higher percentage of carbon dioxide (c

’ than natural gas.

° Includes water vapor, hydrogen sulphide (H,s
traces of other gases.

matter such as agricultural waste, manure, municj
waste, plant material, sewage, green waste, or foo,

Hydrogen
Hydrogen is the most abundant element on Earth and Po
sesses the highest calorific value among all fuels. While

does not exist naturally as a gas, it is a versatile ener
carrier. Let’s look at the following factors:

Advantages

1. High Energy Density: Its high energy density 5
weight makes it an efficient fuel.

2. Clean Combustion: Hydrogen produces only wate
vapor upon combustion, making it an environmen
tally friendly option.

3. Efficiency in Energy Conversion: Fuel cells usin
hydrogen are highly efficient.

4. Renewable and Abundant: Hydrogen can be pro
duced from renewable resources and is abundant 0
Earth.

5. Zero-Emissions and Clean Burning: It produces n
greenhouse gases in fuel cells and burns cleanly.

6. Versatile and Highly Reactive: Usable in various appli
cations and readily reacts with oxygen, forming water.

Limitations

1. Storage Challenges: Storing hydrogen is difficult

due to its low density.

2. Infrastructure Development Needs: Significant
infrastructure is required for production, distribution,

and refuelling.

3. Safety and Reactivity: Its high flammability and

reactivity require careful handling.

4. Environmental Impact of Production: Common
production methods, such as natural gas reforming,

can have environmental impacts.

5. Energy Conversion Challenges: Isolating hydrogen.

from other elements for use as a fuel or in electric-

ity generation through fuel cells presents technical

challenges.

Hydrogen Mission in India
India has launched the National Hydrogen Mission to har-

ness the potential of hydrogen as a clean and sustainable

energy source. This mission aims to:

1. Develop hydrogen as an alternative fuel for transpor-
tation, industry, and power generation.

2. Promote the production of green hydrogen using
renewable energy sources and electrolysers.

duction methods:

ey Hydrogen: Produced from fossil fuels, typically
ural gas, with associated carbon emissions.

jue Hydrogen: Also derived from fossil fuels but

ydrogen is generated using methane pyrolysis, poten-
ally with carbon capture to minimize emissions.

ink Hydrogen: Produced using nuclear energy.

| cells are advanced electrochemical devices that uti-
_ hydrogen as their primary fuel source. They directly
vert chemical energy into electricity and heat. They
’t involve the combustion of fossil fuels, so they are
lean and sustainable energy technology. Normally,
rogen can be produced through an electrolyte where
gen is also formed.

Other points of fuel cells are as follows:

Versatile Fuel Use: Fuel cells can operate on a variety
of fuels including hydrogen, natural gas, methanol,
and biogas.

Hydrogen as a Key Component: In many types of
fuel cells, hydrogen is the primary and most efficient
fuel used. This does not add to GHG emissions.
‘Reforming Process’ for Alternative Fuels: Fuels
like natural gas, methanol, and biogas are converted
into hydrogen through a process called reforming,
which involves a chemical reaction with steam and a
catalyst.

Specific Process for Methanol: In the case of metha-
nol, steam reforming or methanol reforming is used
to produce hydrogen for fuel cells.

Versatile Applications: Fuel cells have found appli-
cations in various sectors, including space explora-
tion, where their reliability and efficiency are crucial.
Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs): They represent
a promising solution for reducing urban air pollution.
These vehicles use fuel cells to power electric motors,
offering a clean alternative to traditional internal
combustion engines.

verall, fuel cells demonstrate the potential for diversify-
§ energy resources beyond traditional fossil fuels.

Sorar Enercy

Solar energy is one of the most renewable and sustainable
sources of energy. That’s why it is important for our energy
security. We need to see how does Sun produces its own energy.

Law of Conservation of Energy: This law has two parts
—law of Transformation and Energy Balance. This law pri-
marily states that energy cannot be created or destroyed;
it can only transformed from one form to another. The
balance of energy is to be maintained.

Fusion and Fission: The nuclear processes involved in the
production of energy have been briefly discussed below:

1. Nuclear Fusion Process: This happens In the core of
Sun where hydrogen atoms undergo nuclear fusion. The
hydrogen nuclei (protons) are fused together to form
helium. Some mass is lost that releases a significant
amount of energy. This is the prime source of energy.

2. Proton-Proton Chain Reaction: The four hydrogen
nuclei are combined through a series of steps to ulti-
mately form a single helium nucleus.

The point to be noted that the initial hydrogen nuclei and
the final helium nucleus is converted into energy accord-
ing to Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence principle (E =
mc?). We can observe this through the Sun’s luminosity.

Then shifting the scene to the ground. Sun is the ulti-
mate source of energy for Earth. This energy on earth
comes in two forms — directly and indirectly.

Direct Use or So_tar Power

¢ Through Photosynthesis: That end product is Food
which is then eaten by animals and humans, provid-
ing us with energy.

e Photovoltaic (PV) cells: These cells use a semicon-
ductor material to absorb light and generate elec-
tron-hole pairs. These electron-hole pairs are then
collected by electrical contacts to create an electric
current. These cells are common, and are relatively
simple and inexpensive to produce.

How a solar power system works?

1. Sunlight hits the solar panels and is converted into

direct current (DC) electricity.

DC electricity is then passed through the inverter,

which converts it into alternating current (AC)

electricity.

3. The AC electricity can then be used to power your
home or business, or it can be stored in batteries for
later use.

4. If you have a grid-connected solar system, any excess
electricity that you generate can be sold back to the
utility company.

Photo Electro Chemical (PEC) Solar Cells

e PEC solar cells generate electricity using a semicon-
ductor and an electrolyte.

¢ Light creates electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor.

e Electron-hole pairs trigger an electrochemical reac-
tion in the electrolyte.

e This reaction produces electricity collected by the
semiconductor and electrolyte.

e PEC solar cells can produce renewable hydrogen via
water splitting, yielding hydrogen and oxygen gases.

2

Concentrated Solar Power (CSP): CSP uses mirrors or
lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver. This heat
can then be used to generate electricity or to produce
other forms of energy, such as hydrogen fuel.

Organic Photovoltaics (OPV): This technology uses
organic (carbon-based) materials as semiconductors to
convert sunlight into electricity. OPV solar cells are flex-
ible and lightweight, and they can be produced at a rela-
tively low cost. However, they are also less efficient than
traditional silicon-based solar cells.

Inpinect Use or Sotar Power

¢ Fossil Fuels: Coal, oil, and natural gas come from
decayed plants and animals, which originally got
energy from the sun.

° Hydropower: Water movement generates power.
The sun evaporates ocean water, causing rain or
snow. This flows into rivers, turning turbines to make
electricity.

e Wind Power: Wind is created by the sun heating the
Earth unevenly, causing air to move. This wind move-
ment generates power.

India as a Major Solar Power

The following factors contribute to this:

¢ Location of India: India is located in Northern
Hemisphere, with the Tropic of Cancer passing
through its central region, that divides India into
two equal parts. Many regions in India enjoy more
than 300 sunny days per year, ideal for solar power
generation.

¢ Technological Advancements: There has been

‘development of more efficient solar panels, solar

storage solutions, and innovative applications i
solar-powered irrigation and transportation,

1. Cost Reduction: This has been achieved through ,
icy support, increased manufacturing capacity
technological advancements. The capacity expang, )
has taken place through big projects.

2. Government Initiatives: The National Solar Mis.
(NSM), part of the National Action Plan on Climag,

Change, aims to establish India as a global leade
solar energy. There are ambitious targets and th
execution. The initial NSM target of 20GW that
set in 2010 was revised to 1OOGW in 2015. The]
projects were set up.
India became a partner nation with France ;
International Solar Alliance in 2015. This has bee
discussed later also. This significant partnership wa
announced during the COP21 Paris summit.

3. Challenges: Despite the rapid growth, there are cha
lenges such as land acquisition, grid connectivi¢
storage solutions and financial constraints for larg
scale projects. There is requirement of robust ener
storage solutions and grid management to ensure.
steady supply of electricity.

ino ENERGY

nd turbines harness the power of the wind to generate
tricity. This happens in the following manner:

Wind Capture: Wind turbines have large blades that
catch the wind. A minimum wind speed of 15 kmph is
required for wind energy farms. This scene depends
upon the Earth’s natural wind patterns.

Mechanical Energy Conversion: When the wind
blows, it pushes on the blades, making them spin.
Generation of Electricity: The spinning blades turn
- ashaft inside the turbine.

“Transmission of Electricity: The shaft is connected
to a generator, which creates electricity from the spin-
ning shaft’s movement.

Integration into the Power Grid: The electricity gen-
erated is fed into the power grid, where it is distrib-
uted for use in homes, businesses, and other facilities.

(60 meters) and towers reaching over 260 feet (80
meters) high. They can power thousands of homes.
Netherlands, with over 1,600 windmills is called as
the ‘land of windmills’.

These are as follows:

1. Wind energy is infinite and sustainable Resource.
This may work 24x7 depending upon weather pat-
tern. Wind turbines can be located onshore (on land)
or offshore (in bodies of water). Offshore turbines
tend to be larger and can capture more wind due to
less obstruction and higher wind speeds over water.
This is environmentally friendly as there is no pol-
lution or GHG emissions. This is a cleaner air and a
reduced carbon footprint.

This is scalable as there is a viable option for meeting
growing energy demands.

This is versatile as there is scope of mechanical energy
for tasks such as pumping water or grinding grains.
Land Multifunctionality is there as the land around
windmills can be used for farming, allowing for a
dual-use of the space.

Limitations: Many challenges are there as were in Solar.
In addition

° Wildlife Impact: Wind turbines can pose a threat to
certain wildlife species, particularly birds and bats,
through collisions or habitat disruption.

e Noise Pollution: There may be non stop noise pollu-
tion in case wind mill is operative.

e Land Requirement: This may be an issue in popu-
lated regions.

° Maintenance Costs: Maintaining and servicing wind
turbines can be costly, impacting the overall economic
feasibility of wind energy systems.

The major wind producing nations in the world are China,
United States, Germany, India, Spain and Brazil.

According to the Ministry of New and Renewable
Energy (MNRE), the five top wind energy producing
states in India in 2022-23 are: Tamil Nadu, Gujarat,
Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Karnataka.

Note: Karnataka (29%), Rajasthan (20%), Tamil Nadu
(18%), Andhra Pradesh (16%), and Gujarat (14%) are
the top five states in terms of solar and wind energy con-
tribution to their total energy production.

HypDROELEcTRIC POWER

This is basically harnessing the ‘Energy of Water’. The
hydropower is a renewable energy source that generates
electricity from the movement of water. It utilizes the
natural water cycle, which is constantly replenished by
rainfall and snowfall.

Conversion of Energy: The solar energy results in the
flow of water.

The key components of hydroelectric power project
are dams (reservoirs of water), waterwheels for storing
water. Then turbines are turned with flow of water.

We can see the energy conversion from the following
points:

1. Gravitational Energy: Water stored in a reservoir
at a high elevation possesses gravitational potential
energy, that is due to pull of gravity.

2. Potential Energy Conversion into Kinetic Energy:
Once the water is released from the reservoir and
starts coming down, the potential energy is converted
into kinetic energy.

3, Kinetic Energy: As the water flows downward, it gains
speed, and its kinetic energy increases with the more
downward flow of water. This rotates the turbines.

4. Turbine Rotation: The rotational motion of the tur-

bines represents mechanical energy. That is trans-

ferred to generators through a shaft connection.

Electricity Generation: Inside the generators, the

mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy

through a process called electromagnetic induction.

vi

The generated electricity is then transmitted through
power lines to homes, businesses, and industries for vari-
ous uses.

The key factors for energy production are water flow,
volume of water (reservoir), and the height of the fall
(head) determine electricity generation.

india’s Capacity and Projects

Hydropower is a major contributor to India’s renewable
energy, with significant installed capacity. The five big-
gest projects in India are given below:

source, that accounts for 12.3% of its total utility
power generation capacity.

e India has an installed hydroelectric power capacity of
46,000 MW as of 31 March 2023.

¢ This power potential is estimated at 148,700 MW,

e This power generation in India is growing rapidly,
with 156 TWh generated in the fiscal year 2019-20.

e India is committed to expanding its hydroelectric
power capacity to 175 GW by 2027.

Challenges

The loss to environment is in the form of potential floods,
biodiversity loss, fish migration issues, silt accumulation.
Dams impact fish migration and may cause floods and
biodiversity loss. Hydroelectric power is environmentally
friendly but requires careful management for long-term
viability. Hydroelectric power is environmentally friendly
but requires careful management for long-term viability.
Aging infrastructure, sedimentation are the issues.

GEOTHERMAL ENERGY

1, Geothermal Energy Source: Comes from Earth’s
natural heat, often near hot springs.

2. Core Heat Utilization: Uses heat from Earth’s core,
visible as hot springs and geysers.

3. Electricity Generation: Hot water and steam from
geothermal areas power turbines to create electricity.

Methods for Harnessing Geothermal Energy

1. Dry Steam Power Plant: This method utilizes the
direct flow of high-pressure steam from underground
reservoirs to turn turbines and generate electricity.

2. Flash Cycle Plant: In this approach, pressurized hot
water is extracted from geothermal reservoirs, caus-

. ing it to ‘flash’ into steam, which is then used to pro-
duce electricity.

3. Binary Cycle Power Plants: These systems trans
heat from geothermal fluids to a secondary fluid wit
a lower boiling point. The secondary fluid vaporize
and drives a turbine, producing electricity.

Important Points
¢ Geothermal energy is still in the experimental phag,
in India.

e India has significant untapped geothermal potentia}

estimated at over 10,000 MW.

e Geothermal resources in India are spread across seve,

provinces: Himalayas, Sohana, West Coast, Cambay, Son,
Narmada-Tapi (SONATA), Godavari, and Mahanadi.

.° Geothermal energy offers a promising approac

_ for sustainable power generation in India and othe

regions, utilizing the Earth’s natural heat reservoirs t

address rising energy demands.

Ethanol

Ethanol, produced from crops like corn, sugarcane, an
wheat, is renewable. This is made by fermenting sugar
or starches in these crops. Ethanol is an alcohol that j
used as a biofuel. This is blended with gasoline to lowe
carbon emissions in transportation. Thus, ethanol offers,
greener option compared to conventional petrol.

1. Brazil’s Policy: Mandates blending 27 to 30% etha.
nol with gasoline.
2. India’s Biofuel Goal: Aims for 20% ethanol in petro
(E20) and 5% biodiesel (E05) in diesel by 2030,.a
per the National Policy on Biofuels (2018).
3. Energy Security: Ethanol reduces the oil imports
thus enhances energy independence.

Comparison with Petrol (or Gasoline): Ethanol ha
lower energy content compared to gasoline, meanin
more ethanol is needed to produce the same energy. Tha
is linked with energy density.

But Ethanol combustion emits fewer greenhouse gase:
than gasoline, aiding in climate change mitigation.

Higher ethanol blends require modifications in trad
tional gasoline engines.

Biodiesel in National Biofuel Policy

1. National Biofuel Policy Feedstocks: Encompasse
a wide range of materials like sugarcane, maize, so
ghum, sweet potato, cassava, tapioca, algae, municip
solid waste, agricultural residues, and animal waste.

2. Ethanol Production: Involves fermenting sugars of
starches found in feedstocks like sugarcane and maize.

About Biodiesel

1. The Main Feedstocks for Biodiesel are oilseeds like
soybean, rapeseed (canola), sunflower, palm oil, an
jatropha.

* Used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats are also.
sources.
* Algae is another potential feedstock.

2. Jatropha is a non-food, drought-resistant plant, ideal
for biodiesel production.

Biodiesel composition is possible ‘in the following ways:
» Made with fatty acid methyl esters.
¢ Blended with diesel for use in engines.

qhe choice of biodiesel feedstock varies regionally, based
availability and suitability.

FLEX Fue. Ano Hysrip Evectric VEHICLES
(HEVs)

| A flex-fuel engine is an internal combustion engine
capable of running on a blend of gasoline and etha-
nol, with a maximum ethanol content of 85% (E85).
E85 is the official name for flex-fuel. It has 85 per-
¥ cent ethanol fuel and 15 percent gasoline or other
| hydrocarbon by volume.

Note that ethanol is a biofuel derived from plants
like corn or sugarcane.

| Fuel Adjustment: Flex-fuel engines are designed
| to adapt their fuel-air mixture and timing to accom-
| modate the different properties of gasoline and eth-
| anol. This adaptability allows them to run smoothly
| on various blends of the two fuels.

| Regional Variations: Flex-fuel engines are more
prevalent in certain parts of the world, notably the
United States, where E85 fuel stations are widely
available. In contrast, they are less common in
regions like Europe and Asia.

|. The Environmental Benefits: There will be reduced
GHGs courtesy ethanol. There will be reduced reli-
ance on foreign oil, so import bills are cut, specially
in India. The farmers get additional income.

Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs)
A hybrid car is a type of vehicle that uses a combi-
nation of two or more power sources, typically an
internal combustion engine (ICE) and an electric
motor. There are two variants:

Parallel hybrid car: Here, the driver has the option
to choose from three combinations — hybrid, ICE or
Power Motor. In series option.

Series hybrid cars: In a series hybrid car, the elec-
tric motor is the primary power source, and the ICE
acts as a generator to charge the battery.

Overall, hybrid cars offer the benefits of saving

eds lik | money on fuel, quieter operations, reduced main-
oil, an tenance cost and less emissions. The fuel economy

benefits us if electric power is less costly but used
are als more. ICE is used less time when it is actually

required at the times of higher acceleration. Even
when ICE is in operation, electric power will be pro-
duced. Thus, overall fuel cost will be less.

BIOMASS
e Biomass basically refers to organic materials derived
from plants and animals. These materials can be used

as a source of energy.

e Biomass includes things like wood, crop residues
(like corn stalks}, and even things like manure from
animals.

e This is assumed to be a renewable energy source
as they can always grow. This is carbon-neutral in
nature. This doesn’t emit greenhouse gases.

e Biomass isa part of the National Biofuel Policy of India:

Nucitear ENERGY

Nuclear energy is dense energy. This is derived from the
mass of atomic nuclei converted into energy. As discussed,
the required nuclear reactions happen in two forms -
nuclear fission (splitting of atomic nuclei) or nuclear
fusion (combining of atomic nuclei).

Einstein’s Formula: Discussed earlier, this formula
is a principle behind nuclear energy, Albert Einstein’s
equation E = mc’, where ‘E’ is the Energy produced, ‘m’
is the nuclear mass and ‘c’ represents the speed of light in
a vacuum.

Thus, a small amount of mass can be converted into
a large amount of energy. Ultimately, this energy is then
harnessed to generate electricity, typically by heating
water to create steam that drives turbines.

Major Parts of a Nuclear Reactor

1. . Fuel Rods: Contain fissile materials like uranium-235
or plutonium-239 for nuclear fission.

2. Control Rods: Made of neutron-absorbing materials
such as boron, hafnium, or cadmium to regulate the
nuclear reaction.

3. Moderator: Substances like water, heavy water, or
graphite slow down neutrons to facilitate fission.

4, Coolant: Often water, but can be heavy water, liquid
sodium, or carbon dioxide gas, used to remove heat
from the reactor core.

5, Containment Vessel: Constructed from steel and
reinforced concrete to contain radiation and with-
stand extreme pressures.

Nuclear Fuels used by India
1. Natural uranium: The most common type, it is used
in pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs), which
account for over 70% of India’s nuclear power genera-
tion capacity.

2. Enriched uranium (EU): This is used in light water
reactors (LWRs). Natural uranium is composed
of approximately 0.72% U-235 and 99.28% ura-
nium-238 (U-238), a non-fissile isotope. EU is a form
of uranium in which the proportion of uranium-235
(U-235), the ‘fissile isotope’, has been increased rela-
tive to its natural abundance. Enriching uranium
means increasing the concentration of U-235 to a
level sufficient to sustain a nuclear chain reaction.
EU can be of two types:

Low EU: This contains between 3% and 20% U-235.
This is used in common nuclear power reactors.
Highly EU: The percentage of U-235 is often greater
than 20%. This may be used for research and nuclear
weapons. This has stringent controls.

Depleted Uranium: The waste uranium is known as
depleted uranium which is to be safely disposed off in
stable geological formations, such as granite or clay
or’spent fuel casks.

3, Mixed Oxide Fuel (MOX): Plutonium is used in MOX
fuel, which is a blend of plutonium and uranium,
and can be used in certain types of nuclear reactors
to produce energy. MOX fuel is used in prototype
fast breeder reactors (PFBRs). Plutonium has a high
energy density and can provide fuel for long periods,
making it efficient for long-term energy generation.
Plutonium can be used to make nuclear weapons also.

4, Thorium as a Nuclear Fuel in India: India has abun-
dant reserves of thorium, this fertile material that can
be converted into fissile uranium-233. They are yet to
see commercial success. India is the largest producer
of thorium in the world, that is found in monazite

sand. Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha
have the largest thorium reserves. Brahmaputra river
basin and the Khasi Hills also have rich monazite (and
thus thorium) deposits. Assam, Arunachal Pradesh,
Meghalaya, and Nagaland are the popular NE states.

Use of Heavy Water in Nuclear Reactors: There is pro-
duction of neutrons during uranium fission process, they
needed to be slowed down for further nuclear fuel (usu-
ally uranium) fission. Heavy water performs that function.
Slows down neutrons produced during the fission process.

A big nuclear power plant might release extra heat into |
a nearby river or lake. This can make the water too warm,
which is harmful to fish and other creatures living in the _
water.

There are basically two types of activities:
1.

Natural Interaction: These occur in the natural man-
ner as some basic aspects have been discussed earlier.
The ecology, ecosystems, biomes, biospheres, atmo-
spheric layers etc. are all natural.

Anthropogenic Activities: This stage is marked by
‘Anthropocene era’. This suggests that there is a pro-
posed geological epoch that recognizes the signifi-
cant impact humans have had on Earth’s geology and
ecosystems. These developmental activities initially
aimed to improve human living standards, we have
advancements in technology and medicine. We can
have a look in the following manner:

1. Origin of Life: Life started with single-cell organ-
isms around 3 billion years ago.

2. Atmospheric Changes Over Time: There has been
a gradual change in levels of gases like oxygen and
carbon dioxide over this extensive period with evo-
lution, diversity of life, and also population growth.

3. Global Warming, Pollution and Climate Change:
There were phenomena of industrialization, urban-
ization, deforestation etc. The situation worsened
with increase in emission of Green House gases
which were heat trapping and led to global warming.

4. Scale and Duration of Changes: These environ-
mental changes have grown from being local to
having a global impact and have shifted from being
short-term disturbances to long-term challenges.

ivieact OF ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES ON
AGRICULTURE

The main impacts on traditional agriculture include
deforestation (clearing forests for farming), soil erosion
(loss of topsoil from wind or water and depletion of nutri-
ents (overuse leads to less fertile soil).



=== Page 93 ===
9.32

The other key issues are:

1. Micronutrient Imbalance: Too much nitrogen, phos-
phorus, and potassium.

1. Nitrate Pollution: Nitrates seep into the soil
and contaminate groundwater. When their con-
centration exceeds 25 mg/L, they can cause
health issues such as blue baby syndrome or
methemoglobinemia.

Eutrophication: The issue is primarily caused by
the excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorus fer-
tilizers in agriculture.

Figure 9.16 Impact of Anthropogenic Activities

* This process has harmful consequences, dam-
aging aquatic ecosystems and affecting water
quality.

* The poor water quality resulting from this issue
can be harmful to both wildlife and humans.

2. Pesticide Usage and Irrigation Challenges in
Agriculture: Pesticides, including herbicides, insec-
ticides, and fungicides, come in various forms: inor-
ganic, synthetic, or biological (biopesticides). These
are used to control pests and diseases in crops, but
they vary in their environmental impact.
Waterlogging: This is caused due to agricultural
practices such as excess irrigation, where soil is overly
saturated with water, that hinders plant growth.

Soil salinity: The high levels of soluble salts in the
soil, often as the result of the over-irrigation or poor
drainage, negatively affect crop health and yield.

Housine Sector Retatep Issues

* When these fertilizers are washed into Water
bodies, they lead to the overgrowth of alga,
a phenomenon known as ‘algae bloom’ which
blocks sunlight from reaching underwate;
plants, which disrupts the aquatic ecosystem,
* As the excess algae die and decompose, they
consume oxygen in the water, resulting in oxy.
gen depletion. :
* This oxygen depletion creates ‘dead zones?
where aquatic life struggles to survive due to.
the lack of oxygen.

uted to poor indoor air quality, that is primarily caused —
by volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs emanates’.
from paints, solvents, and wood preservatives.

Cancer Risk from Metals: Arsenic, cadmium, chro-
mium, and nickel-in construction materials. These
increase the risks of lung, skin, and other cancers.
Formaldehyde: They are emitted from pressed wood
products. They cause respiratory problems and some
cancers.

Benzene: This is commonly found in glues, paints,
and some plastics, benzene is a carcinogen that can
cause blood disorders, including various forms of leu-
kemia. Long-term exposure, even at low levels, can

increase the risk. activi



=== Page 94 ===
Trichloroethylene: This is used in cleaning products.
This can cause liver and lung cancers, and non-Hodg-
kin lymphoma.

Ozone: Ozone, particularly at ground level, is a reac-
tive gas that can be harmful to health. It is often gen-
erated by electronic equipment such as copiers and
laser printers. This can cause respiratory such as
asthma and lung diseases.

Health Risks from Air Conditioning: The growth
of bacteria and mould in AC systems can pose health
risks. These microorganisms can lead to various respi-
ratory issues.

Legionnaires’ Disease: A severe pneumonia-like
illness caused by bacteria found in AC systems.
Symptoms include coughing, shortness of breath,
fever, muscle aches, and headaches.
Asbestos-Related Diseases: Asbestos is a group
. of naturally occurring silicate minerals with thin,
fibrous crystals. They are widely used in construction
for insulation, roofing, and fireproofing. They are
known for resistance to heat, electricity, and chemical
corrosion. Their inhalation can cause mesothelioma,
asbestosis, and lung cancer.

Allergies from Pests: These occur particularly from
cockroach droppings, dust mites; and rodent dan-
der. These allergens can trigger allergic reactions and
asthma in sensitive individuals.

EFFECTS OF TRANSPORTATION ACTIVITIES ON
NVIRONMENT

. Emission of Gases: Transportation releases gases like
lead, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO,),
methane (CH,), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrous oxide
(N,O), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), perfluorocar-
bons (PFCs), heavy metals, and particulates into the
atmosphere.

Ozone Layer Depletion: Nitrous oxide contributes to
the depletion of the ozone layer, which protects the
Earth from harmful UV radiation.

Greenhouse Effect: CO, CO,, and CH, contribute to
the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming.
Acid Rain: The interaction of CO, NO,, SO,, NOx
with water vapor in the atmosphere leads to acid
rain, which can damage buildings, harm crops, and
degrade forests.

- Noise Pollution: Prolonged exposure to noise levels
above 75 dB from transportation can impair hearing
and affect physical and psychological health.

Errects of ANTHROPOGENIC Minine Activities

Mining is done primarily to extract minerals, metals, and
other valuable materials from the earth. They can be used
for manufacturing, construction, energy production, and
echnology. Land dredging (creating holes in land) and
tiver dredging (moving along a river on a platform or
s of leu- boat).

an. * : ane
els, ¢ 1. Deforestation: A primary consequence of mining

activities.

9.33

2. Chemical Usage: Use of harmful chemicals like cya-
nide and mercury in mineral extraction.

3. Land and Water Damage:
* Degradation of vegetation and landscape

alteration.

¢ Land subsidence and a damage (e.g.,
building cracks).

* Groundwater contamination by sulphuric acid
and heavy metals.

° Surface water pollution affecting aquatic life,
including potential radioactive contamination.

4. Air Pollution and Health Hazards: Separate issues
like air pollution and occupational health risks (asbes-
tosis, silicosis, black lung disease) for miners.

5. Uranium Mining: Uranium ore emits radon gas and
other radioactive elements. Prolonged exposure to
high levels of radiation can increase the risk of lung
cancer and other health issues.

Environmental issues need a global approach with ‘com-
mon future’ or ‘global sharing’ concepts. Economic
inequalities affect sustainable development worldwide.
Environmental concerns differ between developed and
developing countries:

1. Local Issues: Such as water shortages, soil erosion,
pollution levels, and landslides.

2. Regional Issues: Include desertification, droughts,
floods, soil erosion, sea-level rise, and deforestation.

3. Global Issues: Climate change, global warming,
the North-South divide, and loss of biodiversity are
critical.

Agenda 21: This agenda tried to address many environ-
mental issues so that is better alignment among different
nations for sustainable development. This included differ-
ences between North (developed) and South (less devel-
oped) Nations. North has technology and capital and
South has mineral and other resources. It acknowledges
the fact that most of global environmental degradation is
caused by North, South is more vulnerable to these envi-
ronmental issues.

° Thus, the principle of ‘common but differentiated
responsibilities’ is central to Agenda 21. Though all
nations have to take responsibility in environmental
protection, but developed countries have a larger role
to play due to their historical role as industrialisation,
urbanisation started in the North nations.

¢ The North has to take responsibility of technology
transfer and financial assistance. There is a felt need
to enhance the participation of developing countries
in the global economy. Their growth should become
sustainable and equitable.

° There is need to make sustainable consumption pat-
terns across the world. An integrated approach is
required towards the issues of environment, sustain-
ability, economy and poverty reduction.

Rove oF CO, in Cumate CHANGE

Carbon dioxide enjoys a separate status due to its green-
house gas status, long term impact, different regulatory
framework, and sources and emission control. It may
seem that whole unit is built around this.

1. Increase in Atmospheric CO, Concentration: The
concentration of CO, in the atmosphere increased
significantly due to anthropogenic activities. The
excessive use of fossil fuels played its own role. This
level has reached 418 ppm now in 2023. During pre-
industrial era in 1850's, it was 280 ppm. Thus, there
is almost a 50% increase the concentration.

2. Enhanced Greenhouse Effect: CO, acts as a green-
house gas, which trap the heat around the earth. The
increased use has resulted in an average global tem-
perature rise of 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels so
far.

3. Consequences of Climate Change: The above

resulted in extreme weather patterns, disruption of

ecosystems, sea rise and harmful ocean acidification,
rapidly melting ice, severe cyclones, biodiversity loss.

Mitigation Efforts: They started in the forms of Kyoto

Protocols, Paris Agreements etc to limit carbon emis-

sions. Then efforts started in the form of renewable

energy, reforestation etc.

Pollution is the introduction of harmful substances or
energy into the environment, resulting in adverse effects
on the environment, human health, or the quality of life.
These harmful substances, known as pollutants, can be
physical, chemical, or biological in nature. They can be
introduced into the environment intentionally or uninten-
tionally, through human activities or natural processes.

Pollutant Levels: As pollutants have toxic effects, their
toxicological assessment levels have been given below.
They help in setting safety standards:

° NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Level): Used
to set safe exposure limits and derive the Benchmark
Dose (BMD), which estimates the dose causing a spe-
cific level of effect in a population.

* LD5O (Lethal Dose, 50%): Utilized to classify sub-
stances according to the Globally Harmonized System
(GHS) hazard class, indicating the dose lethal to 50%
of test subjects.

* LOAEL (Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level):
Helps derive the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), the
daily intake amount over a lifetime without causing
adverse effects.

® NOEFF (No Observed Effect Level): Used to estab-
lish the Reference Dose (Rf£D), the amount that can be
inhaled daily over a lifetime without adverse effects.

The main pollution types have been discussed below:

Air PoLtuTtion

World Health Organization (WHO) defines air Pollution
as ‘the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environ.
ment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that
modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere,

This definition encompasses a wide range of pollut.
ants, including gases like sulphur dioxide (SO,), nitrogen
oxides (NO,), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (0,), as
well as particulate matter (PM), both PM10 and PM2.5
(particulates with diameters of 10 micrometers and 2.5
micrometers, respectively).

WHO definition includes diverse sources such as indus.
trial activities, vehicles, and natural processes. Pollution
affects both indoor and outdoor environments. This can
lead to alterations in the atmosphere. There is human
contribution in the form of human roles in causing air
pollution.

Pure Gases

The basic idea about pure gases is important as we can
compare them with pollutant gases for differentiation.

° Noble Gases: Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar),
Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), Radon (Rn) - characterized
by their chemical inertness (inactivity) due to a full
valence electron shell.

° Elemental Gases: Hydrogen (H2), Oxygen (O,),
Nitrogen (Nz), Chlorine (Cl,)-consist of diatomic mol-
ecules with two atoms of the same element.

* Other Gases: Carbon Dioxide (CO), Nitrous Oxide
(N20), and Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF,) are also con-

sidered pure gases.

Types of Air Pollutants: There are two main kinds of ait.
pollutants:

i. Primary Pollutants: These come straight from places
like cars and factories.



=== Page 96 ===
« Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) or
Particulate Matter (PM): Tiny particles sus-
pended in the air. (discussed below)

* Oxides of Carbon: Includes carbon monoxide
and carbon dioxide.

¢ Hydrocarbons: Methane and other organic
compounds.

« Sulphur Oxides (SOx)

e« Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)

e CFCs: Chlorofluorocarbons, harmful to the ozone
layer.

¢ Lead: Heavy metal pollutant

articulate Matter (PM): SPM or PM includes soot (incom-
jete burning of organic matter), smoke (fires, industry,
ehicles), dust (natural), fibres (textiles, construction),
ticides, metals (such as mercury, lead and copper), dust
ites (microorganisms) and pollen (air born plant parti-
es). They are more dangerous as they penetrate deeper.

. PM 2.5: Particles with a diameter of 2.5 micro meters
(or say it as pm) or less can penetrate deep into the
lungs.

. PM10: Particles with a diameter of 10 pm or less.
Includes dust, pollen, and mould.

. PM 1: Ultrafine particles with a diameter of 1 jm or
less. They can enter the bloodstream leading to respi-
ratory and cardiovascular issues.

. Total Suspended Particulate Matter (TSPM): They
encompasses all airborne particles, regardless of size.

2. Secondary Pollutants: These don’t come directly
from a source. Instead, they form in the air when pri-
mary pollutants react with other things. Examples
include acid rain and smog. The major air pollutions,
acid rain, smog have been discussed below:

Masor Air PoL_utions
1. Ozone (Ground Level)

Source: Formed by reactions between nitrogen
oxides and volatile organic compounds from
vehicular exhaust, in sunlight.

Health Effects: Aggravates lung diseases like
asthma, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis.

2. Lead

Source: Previously used in leaded petrol as an
anti-knocking agent.

Health Effects: Affects the central nervous sys-
tem, interferes with red blood cell development.

3. Sulphur Dioxide

e

Source: Emitted by thermal power plants and
various industries.

Health Effects: Causes severe respiratory prob-
lems and impairs gas exchange in the lungs.

4. Nitrogen Oxides

°

e

Source: Produced by thermal power plants.
Health Effects: Leads to heart and lung issues,
bronchitis, asthma; potential carcinogen.

5. Carbon Monoxide

7.

Source: Results from incomplete combustion of
fossil fuels, wood stoves, and cigarette smoke.
Health Effects: Reduces oxygen-carrying capac-
ity of blood, causing breathing difficulties.

Hydrogen Sulphide

°

Source: Found around oil refineries and chemical
industries.

Health Effects: Causes nausea, eye and throat
irritation.

Hydrogen Cyanide

Source: Emitted from blast furnaces, used in
fumigation and in the chemical industry.

Health Effects: Leads to headaches, dry throat,
blurred vision, and nerve cell dysfunction.

Ammonia

Source: Produced in the fertilizer industry, dye-
making, bleaching, and explosives manufacturing.
Health Effects: At high levels, it can lead to the
acidification of water bodies.

neys, can cause jaundice.
12. Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM)
© Source: Emitted from incinerators and various manu-
facturing processes.
° Health Effects: Leads to respiratory issues like
emphysema, asthma, and chronic bronchitis

Acio Rain

* Acid Rain pH: Natural rainwater has a pH around 5.6

due to dissolved atmospheric carbon dioxide, forming

weak carbonic acid. Acid rain has a pH lower than 5.6.

Source of Acid Rain: Emissions of sulphur dioxide

(SO,) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from sources like

power plants, industries, and vehicles lead to acid

rain. .

° Formation Process: SO, and NOx react with water
vapor, oxygen, and other atmospheric chemicals to
produce sulfuric and nitric acids. Let’s see the exam-
ple of formation of Sulphuric Acid:

Sulphur trioxide (SO3) reacts with water vapor in
the atmosphere to form sulphuric acid (H,SO,). This
reaction is a key step in the formation of acid rain.

* §0,+H,0->H,SO,.

* Formation of Acid Rain:

® Acid rain is formed when sulphuric acid (from
SO3) and nitric acid (formed from nitrogen
oxides) dissolve in atmospheric moisture (like
rain, fog, snow, or even dry particles).

e These acids lower the pH of the precipitation,
resulting in acid rain.

It can harm lakes, rivers, and forests. It damages for-

ests, especially in high places. It makes it hard for

trees and plants to grow and stay healthy

SmoG

Smog is a mix of two words ‘smoke’ and ‘fog.’ It describes a
type of air pollution that is a combination of smoke, dust,
and other particulates with fog. They create a dense layer
of visible air pollution. This is mainly of two types:

Sulphurous Smog (London Smog)

This mainly comprises of sulphur dioxide and PM, which
often originates from coal-rich industrial areas.

Main Trapping Conditions: This mostly occurs in cold,
humid, and windless conditions that trap pollutants close
to the ground.

- cooler air near the ground. This lid of warm gases pre-

An example is the 1952 London smog, caused by gy,
conditions, resulted in a thick layer of smog over the city,

Health Effects: Leads to respiratory issues, worse
asthma, and can cause lung diseases.
‘Environmental Impact: Harms plant life and corrodes
buildings and structures.
Government policies and a shift to cleaner enero,
sources have reduced sulphurous smog, but it can still ocey;
in coal-dependent areas and specific weather conditions.

Ns

Photochemical Smog (Los Angeles Smog)

This smog is a mixture of pollutants, mainly ground leve,
ozone (O,), resulting from sunlight reacting with nitro.
gen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
from vehicle emissions. oe

This ground-level ozone is specifically formed by sun.
light acting on vehicle emission pollutants. This ground
level ozone is dangerous while stratospheric ozone is ben.
eficial as that protects us from UV radiations.

Peroxyacety] Nitrate (PAN): PAN is asecondary pollutant
in photochemical smog. It forms from chemical reactions
involving VOCs and NOx in sunlight. Emissions from vehj-
cles and industries contribute to this pollution. Exposure to
PAN and photochemical smog can worsen respiratory and
jung conditions like asthma and bronchitis. -

Sunlight (Photochemical) Dependence: This forms in
sunny, urban areas with heavy traffic due to the need for
strong sunlight.

Weather Conditions: This appears as a hazy, brownish
cloud. This occurs under hot, sunny conditions with stag-
nant air. :

Health Effects: Irritates eyes, throat, and lungs, exacerbat-
ing conditions like asthma and chronic bronchitis.

Environmental Impact: Harms. crops, vegetation, and
materials like rubber and plastics.

Los Angeles Connection: This connection appears due
to high vehicle emissions and sunny weather contribute to
its prevalence. Now observed in urban areas globally with
increased vehicle usage and sunny climates. a

Winter Smog: The winter smog in Delhi has some simi
larities with photochemical smog. Winter smog is driven
by a temperature inversion when a layer of warm air traps

vents the intermixing of gases. Then dangerous PM 2.5
also mixes up. There are hazy and smoggy conditions
which obscure the visibility.

Overall, winter smog can be particularly dangerous
due to the combination of stagnant air, increased pollu-
tion sources (e.g., heating), and reduced dispersion of
pollutants. That we commonly observe in Delhi during
winter months.

Photochemical smog, on the other hand, is associated
with the chemical reactions between pollutants like nitro:
gen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (voCs)
in the presence of sunlight.



=== Page 98 ===
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)

VyOCs are chemicals that can easily turn into vapours
or gases. Examples of common VOCs include formal- |
‘dehyde, benzene, xylene, toluene, and various alco- |
hols. They are found in many everyday products like
paints, varnishes, cosmetics, in building materials 5
such as adhesives, upholstery, wood products, even |
petroleum refining, fuels etc. These compounds can |
escape into the air at room temperature, whichis why @
sometimes you can smell them, like the strong scent &
jn new paint or varnish. :
VOCs can cause the following health damages:

4. Carcinogens: Certain VOCs cause cancer. For &
example, benzene is associated with an increased |
risk of leukemia. Formaldehyde exposure is |
linked to nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia. [

2. Respiratory Diseases: Chronic exposure can @
lead to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease (COPD). a

3. Neurological Disorders: affects central ner-
vous system, memory impairment, lack of coor- |
dination etc. :

4, Liver and Kidney Damage: This may be caused f
by trichloroethylene, that is a industrial solvents. 77

5. Endocrine Disruption: This is basically inter- 3

ference of VOCs with body’s hormonal systems.

Atmospheric haze: This is caused by factors like partic-
ulate matter, dust, and pollution, can occur year-round.
The situation is compounded by the presence of its fine

E PM2.5. The extended exposure to PM2.5-rich haze can
on, an ead to severe health issues.

Government Initiatives to control Air Pollution:
There are specific constitutional articles in the Indian
Constitution, such as Article 48A (Directive Principles of

from ‘Good’ to ‘Severe’, based on pollution levels.
These have been given below:

Good (0 -50 - Green): Minimal impact, air quality is

satisfactory.

Satisfactory (51-100-Yellow): Acceptable air qual-

ity, minor concerns for sensitive individuals.

like individuals with respiratory conditions.

Very Poor (201-300-Purple): Health alert, more
serious effects for everyone.

Severe (301-500-Maroon): Hazardous, emergency
conditions with widespread health effects.

National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS):

* NAAQS were developed by the Central Pollution
Control Board which operates under the Ministry of
Environment, Forest and Climate Change in India.

* NAAQS sets limits for about 12 pollutants. These
pollutants are typically categorized into ‘crite-
ria’ air pollutants, including particulate matter
(PM10 and PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO,), nitro-

gen dioxide (NO,), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone

(O,), and lead (Pb).

° NAAQS includes extra pollutants like arsenic,
nickel, benzene, and benzopyrene. These sub-
stances are known for their carcinogenic and toxic
effects.

¢ NAAQS has a focus on PM2.5 also due to its severe
health risks. These fine particles can penetrate
deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream,
causing cardiovascular, respiratory, and other
health problems.

e Efforts such as cleaner fuels and emission norms
have reduced SO, and NO, levels.

¢ Switching from coal to LPG has helped lower pol-
lution. When burned, coal emits a high level of
pollutants, including particulate matter, sulfur
dioxide (SO,), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and vari-
ous greenhouse gases.

System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting

(SAFAR):

A project by the Ministry of Earth Sciences.

¢ Provides real-time air quality information and
forecasts in major cities.

* Developed by the Indian Institute of Tropical
Meteorology, Pune.

e Also includes weather parameter warnings.

Buarat Stace (BS) Norms

BS norms set by the government control pollutants

from vehicles.

These norms are based on European standards (Euro

norms).

The stages range from Bharat I to VI, with BS VI being

the latest.

Lead was removed from automobile fuel in 2000.

BS VI norms, effective from April 1, 2020, signifi-

cantly reduce pollutants:

* Lower PM 2.5 levels (20 to 40 pg/m? in BS-VI
compared to 120 pg/m? in BS-IV).

e Sulphur content reduced to 10 ppm in BS-VI from
50 ppm in BS-IV, reducing particulate matter
emissions and engine wear.

¢ BS-VI vehicles emit 80% less particulate matter
and 70% less nitrogen oxide per kilometer com-
pared to previous standards.

Indoor Air Pollution

e The primary causes are in the forms of inefficient
burning of fuels like cow dung, agricultural waste,
coal, and wood, especially in poorly ventilated homes.

¢ Problem worsens in winter due to closed doors and
windows, particularly in rural areas.

¢ Smokeless chulhas (stoves) were introduced to reduce
indoor pollution but had limited success.

Wain Methods for Controlling Gaseous

Pollutants

1. Combustion: Organic gases and vapours are burned
to make them less harmful. This process turns pollut-
ants into safer substances and water vapor.

2. Absorption: The main role in absorption is played
by the liquid within the scrubbers. This soaks up
pollutants from gases. The scrubbers have a liq-
uid that removes the pollutants, making the air
cleaner.

3. Adsorption: Here, pollutants stick to the surface of
a solid substance. Gases pass through this solid, leav-
ing the pollutants behind and letting clean air pass
through.

4. Fabric Filters: Dust and other particles in gases are
trapped by passing the gas through fabric filters.

5. Electrostatic Precipitators: These use electrical
charges to remove particles from gases,

6. Domestic Measures: Using cleaner fuels like biogas
instead of wood or dung cakes.

_7. Transportation Measures: Carpooling, using pub-

lic transport, using cleaner fuels, regular vehicle

- maintenance, and turning off engines when not
necessary.

8. Industrial Measures: Installing tall chimneys and

less, odourless, and flammable gas that is the Main
component of natural gas.

Why Methane is so dangerous to us. Methane is
basically a greenhouse gas, meaning that it traps heat
in the atmosphere and contributes to climate chan e
Methane is about 25 times more potent at trapping
heat than carbon dioxide (CO2) over a 20-year periog
as its Global Warming Potential (GWP) is 25. A Gwp
is a measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps
in the atmosphere over a specific period, compared tg
carbon dioxide.

1. Natural Processes: This includes biologicaj
activities and environmental changes.
* Biological Activities: Digestion in the diges.

tive system, photosynthesis in plants, and cel.
lular respiration.
¢ Environmental Changes: Natural events like
weathering, erosion, volcanic eruptions, and
geological processes like plate tectonics.

2. Human Activities: Man-made sources are diverse
and impactful.
¢ Garbage Dumps: Decomposing organic waste

generates methane. :

* Oil and Gas Systems: Leakage and venting
during extraction and processing.

¢ Farming: This happens during rice cultivation
that is basically waterlogged conditions. :

* Coal Mining: Releases methane trapped within
coal layers, that is called as ‘coal bed methane’
(CBM). (Gg

¢ Burning for Energy: Combustion of fossil fuels
and biomass releases methane. |

* Treating Wastewater: The decomposition 0:
organic matter in sewage produces methane...

¢ Factory Processes: Certain chemical and
industrial processes emit methane.

* Methanogens: An interesting natural source of
methane is methanogens, a type of bacteria found
in the digestive systems of animals like cows.

* Solifluction and Melting Arctic Permafrost:
Let’s try to understand this with a question set
in UGC NET Exam, on ‘solifluction’. Solifluction
primarily occurs in permafrost (frozen ground)
in polar or subpolar regions that is affected by
the seasonal temperature variations in the soil
there. When the permafrost thaws (or loos:
ens), there is release of methane. The release
of this GHG warns up the planet by trapping
the heat. This becomes a positive feedback loop
that means more and more release of methane:

4. Feedback Loop: Methane release increases with
global warming, which in turn accelerates further
methane release.

5. Rising Levels: Over the past two decades, atmo-
spheric methane levels have risen sharply.

6. Atmospheric Lifetime: Methane remains in the
atmosphere for a shorter duration compared to
carbon dioxide.

7. Climate Impact: Effective reduction of meth-
ane emissions can significantly decelerate global
warming.

8. Major Methane Emitters: Countries like China,
USA, Russia, India, Brazil, and Indonesia are lead-
ing contributors to global methane emissions.

9. Indication of Life on Planets: The presence of
methane on other planets is intriguing because it
can potentially indicate the presence of life, but it
is not definitive proof. The example is Mars.

MONTREAL ProtrocoL (1987)—Manacine
Ozone (O,)

Ozone, particularly at ground level, is a reactive gas that
can be harmful to health. This can cause respiratory such
as asthma and lung diseases. At stratospheric level, it
works as a protective layer, and saves us from cancer and
cataract.

Formation of Ozone in Stratosphere

Ozone is a triatomic molecule of oxygen, that is O,. When
UV radiation strikes an oxygen molecule (O,), it breaks
nto two oxygen atoms.

0,>0+0

These single oxygen atoms are very reactive, they attack
other oxygen molecules and make ozone.

0+0,>0,

Dobson Units (DU): Not getting very technical, One DU
s like having a layer of ozone that’s only about 1.27 mm
or .00127 cms) thick if you could stack all the ozone ina
olumn from the Earth’s surface to the top of the atmos-
here into one thin layer.

Typical Dobson Unit values can range from less than
00 DU in ozone-depleted regions to over 500 DU in areas
with higher ozone levels.

Montreal Protocol: First, we need to get an idea about
he creation of ozone to see how much destruction can be
aused.,

1. Release of Ozone-Depleting Substances (ODS):
Remember from exam point of view that Chloroflu-
orocarbons (CFCs), Halons, Carbon Tetrachloride,
Methyl Chloroform, and Hydrochlorofluorocarbons
(HCFCs) are all classified as Ozone-Depleting Sub-
stances (ODS). These basically consisted of chlorine
and bromine.

9.38

Note: Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) was envisaged to
replace ODS listed above but the release of HFC was
found to be dangerous as it proved to be a dangerous
GHG with very high Global Warming Potential (GWP).
The focus on HFC gave a way to Kigali agreement.

2. Generation of Highly Reactive Atoms: The above
go into stratosphere and get broken by UV radiation.
Once they are broken down in the form of highly reac-
tive chlorine and bromine atoms.

3. ‘Catalytic’ Destruction of Ozone: These highly reac-
tive atoms on coming into contact with ozone mol-
ecules, destroy them.

The End Product: The above reactions lead to the forma-
tion of Ozone Holes and there is Increased UV Radiation.
Now UV radiations can directly enter the earth and cause
cancer, cataract and other diseases.

Montreal agreement kept a phasing out schedule for
the gradual elimination of ODS, with different timelines
for developed and developing countries.

Kigali Agreement (2076)

As discussed, HFC a tool to reduce ODS under Montreal
later proved to be dangerous as it adds to global warming.
So, its reduction was mandatory. The reduction in HFCs
may be up to 40% by late 2040s as per Kigali agreement.
The phase-down of HFCs is expected to avoid up to 0.5°C
of warming by the end of the century. The phase out time-
line is as follows:

e Developed countries (mainly EU and USA) commit-
ted to start reducing HFCs as early as 2019.

e Developing countries follow with a staggered time-
line, beginning either in 2024 or 2028.

Water, vital for life, constitutes a significant portion of liv-
ing cells (60-95%). Earth, often called the ‘Water Planet,’
holds a mere 1.2% accessible fresh water, including
ground ice, lakes, and soil moisture. Demand for water is
rising despite its constant volume, compounded by pol-
lution challenges. Indeed, gravity plays a pivotal role in
the formation and flow of waterfalls within watersheds.
The rivers also flow accordingly. The urban areas demand
more water, while less developed regions often struggle
to meet basic needs.

Water pollution, a global concern, affects drinkable water,
lakes, rivers, and oceans. It involves the contamination
of water bodies with harmful substances, rendering the
water unfit for its intended use.

Key Characteristics of Drinking Water Quality

1. Taste and Odor: Water should be palatable — pleasant
taste and no odour. The presence of chlorine (used for
disinfection), algae, some bacteria, sulphates etc. can
cause off-tastes or odours. The temperature of water
can be linked with growth of microorganisms.

2. Colour: The presence of substances like iron, manga-
nese, and certain organic compounds can cause contami-
nation and provide somewhat bad colour to water. There
can be turbidity issues in water due to pathogens etc.

3. Hardness: This happens asa result of high levels of min-
erals like calcium and magnesium. This affects tastes of
water, and cause scaling in pipes and appliances.

4. pH Level: Environment Protect Agency recommends
a range of 6.5 (slightly acidic) to 8.5 (slightly alka-
line) for pH levels in water. Slightly alkaline (a higher
concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) than hydro-
gen ions (H+)) is good for improved digestion, better
hydration, and detoxification. High levels of acidic or
basic may result in corrosion, scaling, and contamina-
tion may be the results.

Dissolved Oxygen and BOD: These have been dis-

cussed under BOD and COD, discussed separately.

6. Nitrate/Nitrite Levels: Their high levels can be par-
ticularly hazardous for infants and pregnant women,
as they can interfere with blood oxygen levels.

7. Chemical Safety: Too much of metals and heavy met-
als are bad for health. WHO recommends the follow-
ing levels per litre.

1.5 mg/L Chromium

Mercury

6 pg/L

Copper

8. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): This refers to the com-
bined content of all organic and inorganic substances
dissolved in water, including minerals, salts, and
some organic matter. TDS affects the taste and quality
of water, with the following general observations:
¢ Low TDS: Water with low TDS levels (below 300

mg/L) may have a flat or insipid taste.

* Moderate TDS: Levels of TDS between 300 to
600 mg/L can enhance the taste of water, making
it more palatable.

* High TDS: When TDS levels exceed 1000 mg/L,
water may develop a bitter, salty, or metallic taste,
and might not be suitable for drinking.

Types of Water PoLLution

1. Point Source Pollution:

* Results from specific discharge locations, like
industrial wastewater and thermal power plant
effluent.

¢ Major sources include:

OxyGeNn ano Water PotiuTion

Oxygen is the basic ingredient for life. Then, how much
amount of oxygen is required to break down chemicals in
the water? When this number is high, it usually means the
water is highly polluted, and that is a bad news for plants
and animals living in it.

Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD):
* BOD measures the amount of oxygen (in an aquatic
system) that microorganisms will consume to break
down organic matter present in water. It also indi-
cates the amount of biodegradable organic material

in water,

Bioaccumulation and Biomagnification mercur
Both are related concepts in environmental science, but metalle

they refer to different processes:

Bioaccumulation: Bioaccumulation is when an organ-
ism absorbs substances, like chemicals or pollutants,
faster than it can excrete or metabolize them. This leads to
a higher concentration of the toxin in the organism than. _

TERBORNE DISEASES

erborne diseases are illnesses caused by microorgan-
in contaminated water. Their main features vary
wrding to their causative agents:

Bacteria as Causative Agent

Cholera: This causes severe diarrhea and dehydration.
Transmitted through contaminated water or food.
Typhoid Fever: Symptoms include prolonged fever,
headache, nausea, and loss of appetite. Spread
through fecally contaminated water or food.

Virus as a Causative Agent (viral) .

Hepatitis A: Leads to jaundice, abdominal pain, and
fever. Transmitted via contaminated water and food.
Polio: Can cause paralysis and muscle weakness.
_ Spread through contaminated water and food.

, Protozoa as Causative Agent

Giardiasis: Causes diarrhea, gas, and stomach
_cramps. Transmitted through water contaminated
, with the protozoa.

Parasite as Causative Agent

Schistosomiasis: Results in skin rash, fever, and
muscle aches. Contracted through skin contact with
contaminated water.

Metal Contamination-Linked Mostly with Water

Metals normally have a shiny surface, they conduct heat
d electricity, and are malleable (can be hammered into
hin sheets) and ductile (can be drawn into wires). They
nd to lose electrons and form positive ions in chemical
reactions. The examples.are Iron, copper, silver, gold, alu-
Minium, sodium etc.

While heavy metals are a subset of metals character-
ized by their high atomic weight or high atomic number,
and a density at least five times greater than water. Lead,
mercury, cadmium, and arsenic (though technically a
metalloid) are commonly cited examples.

Note: The health issues relating to metals and heavy
Metals fall under both water and solid waste, depending
Upon the context.

Sources of Metal & Heavy Metal Contamination

ndustrial Discharge: Factories involved in mining,
Metal plating, battery manufacturing, tanneries, and

9.41

chemical production often release heavy metals into
water bodies.

Agricultural Runoff: Pesticides and fertilizers can con-
tain heavy metals like arsenic, cadmium, and lead, which
leach into water sources.

Municipal Waste: Improperly managed landfill sites and
sewage can contribute to heavy metal contamination.

Natural Sources: Certain rocks and soils naturally con-
tain heavy metals which can leach into water bodies,
especially in areas of mining activities.

Atmospheric Deposition: Air pollution from industrial
processes can deposit heavy metals into water bodies via
rain.

Impact oF Heavy MevTALS ON HUMAN HEALTH

1. Aluminium: Main Parts Affected: Bones, Kidneys,
Brain, Liver, Musculoskeletal system and Nervous sys-
tem.

Aluminium is a naturally occurring element that is

found in many foods, drinking water, and the envi-

ronment. The blood stream distributes Aluminium to

different body parts.

¢ Aluminium Toxicity: Excessive exposure through
through certain antacids or occupational settings
is associated with neurotoxicity. The potential
effects are:

e Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease:
These are neurodegenerative diseases.

* Bone Loss and Osteoporosis: Aluminium can
interfere with calcium metabolism in bones.

¢ Blood problems: such as anaemia where the
blood does not have enough red blood cells to
carry oxygen throughout the body.

2. Arsenic: Main Parts Affected: Skin, liver, lungs,
bladder
Arsenic is a metalloid, which means it exhibits proper-
ties of both metals and non-metals. This characteristic
influences its behaviour in groundwater. As a metal-
loid, arsenic compounds, including certain acids, can
be more soluble and mobile in aqueous environments
than elemental arsenic. The excess intake through
solubility leads to ‘arsenic poisoning’ which makes
them fatal.

* Skin Problems: hyperpigmentation (darkening
of the skin), hypopigmentation (lightening of the
skin), and the development of skin lesions such
as warts and corns. These skin changes are often

_ referred to as ‘arsenic keratoses.’

¢ Cardiovascular Issues: such as hypertension
and atherosclerosis. ,

* Cancers: such as of skin, lung, bladder.

Cadmium: Main parts affected: Kidneys, lungs,

bones.

Smoking is a direct source of cadmium exposure, and

passive or secondary smoking also contributes to this

exposure.

e Itai-Itai Disease: Itai-Itai disease, known as ‘it
hurts-it hurts’ in Japanese, is characterized by
kidney damage and bone disorders.

¢ Chronic Bronchitis: Cadmium exposure can lead
to chronic bronchitis, a condition characterized
by persistent inflammation and damage to the
airways.

¢ Osteoporosis: Cadmium can disrupt calcium
metabolism in bones, resulting in reduced bone
density.

* Carcinogen: Cadmium is classified as a carcino-
gen, linking it to an increased risk of cancer.

» Chromium: Main Parts Affected: Skin, lungs, respira-

tory system Chromium, particularly in its hexavalent
form (Chromium-6), can have adverse effects on the
body. It primarily affects: .

Skin: skin irritation and dermatitis.

Lungs and Respiratory System: Hexavalent chro-
mium is a known carcinogen resulting in nasal and
sinus cancers.

Gastrointestinal System: A loss to digestion that
results in symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, con-
stipation, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.

. Copper: Main Parts Affected: Liver, kidneys, brain

The copper overload is also called as Wilson’s disease

that is a genetic disorder that results in the accumula-

tion of excess copper in the body. This happens due

to impaired copper metabolism. This can lead to liver

damage, neurological symptoms, and other health

issues.

Iron: The most important physiological function is the

formation of haemoglobin in red blood cells, which is

crucial for oxygen transport. Excess intake of iron can

lead to a condition called iron overload or hemochro-

matosis. Hemochromatosis primarily affects several

parts of the body, including:

¢ Aggravation of Thalassemia: Thalassemia is
a genetic blood disorder that results in the pro-
duction of an abnormal form of haemoglobin or
inadequate production of haemoglobin. This dis-
order leads to excessive destruction of red blood
cells, causing ‘anaemia.’ It aggravates when there
is an additional iron overload in the body, which
is common among thalassemia patients who
undergo regular blood transfusions.

e¢ Organ Damage: There can be organ damage in
the form of liver cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy (heart
muscle disease).

¢ Arrhythmias: There can be issues such as
arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).

¢ Arthropathy: Iron deposition in the joints can
result in joint pain and stiffness, a condition
known as arthropathy. --

e Bronze diabetes: The excessive intake causes
skin pigmentation known as ‘bronze diabetes’.

critical component of terrestrial ecosystems, playing a key
role in water filtration, nutrient cycling, and supporting a
wide range of microbial and animal life.

Main Features of Soil

The soil produces food for all. The following are the main
factors and features of good soil:

1. The Formation of Desirable Quality Soil: This
should be rich in essential components like silicates,
organic material, humus, and clay. The process is
so gradual that it takes thousands of years to form
through natural processes.

2. Dynamic Soil Ecosystem: This is required for proper
thrive, so that it plays a vital role in nutrient cycling.
That includes the absorption of atmospheric nitrogen
in the form of nitrates by nitrifying bacteria, which
are essential for plant growth.

3. Gas Exchange with the Environment: Soil plays a
role in breaking down organic waste and recycling
nutrients back to plants, while also exchanging gases
with the environment.

Soil Horizons

Mature soil is arranged into a series of zones called soil
horizons. The four main soil horizons are:

¢ O horizon: This is the topmost layer of soil and is
made up of freshly fallen leaves, twigs, animal waste,
and fungi.

° A horizon: This layer is made up of partially decom-
posed organic matter (humus) and some inorganic
mineral particles.

° B horizon: This layer is also called subsoil and has
less organic matter and fewer organisms than the A
horizon.

¢ C horizon: This layer is made up of parent material,
which is the material that the soil was formed from.

Types of Soil

We have taken a wholesome view of the soil types in India
from examination point of view. The first six are the most
basic types, the rest four are the popular region wise.

1. Sandy Soil: Found in regions with low rainfall and
well-drained areas, including parts of Rajasthan, Guja-
rat, Punjab, Haryana, and some parts of Uttar Pradesh.

2. Clay Soil: Found in regions with good rainfall, more

prevalent in the eastern and northeastern parts of

India, including parts of West Bengal, Assam, Bihar,

and Odisha.

Silty Soil: Often found in the Indo-Gangetic Plains,

including states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West

Bengal. Also found in delta regions of rivers.

4. Peaty Soil: Typically found in wetlands and marshy
areas in parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and
the northeastern states.

5. Loamy Soil: Relatively widespread in India, found in
various regions, including the Indo-Gangetic Plains,
parts of Central India, and the Deccan Plateau.

6. Chalky Soil: Less common in India but found in hilly
and limestone-rich areas, such as parts of the Himalayan
region and certain regions in the southern states.

7. Alluvial Soil:
¢ Formed due to flooding of plain areas, particu-

larly in lower courses of rivers.

¢ Sedimentary rocks, very fertile, often lacks
humus and nitrogen but rich in potassium.

¢ Suitable for crops like paddy and sugarcane, com-
monly found in the Indo-Gangetic Plains.

8. Red Soil:

* Rich in iron, characterized by its red colour.

¢ Formed from the breakdown of igneous and met-
amorphic rocks.

¢ Found in regions with low rainfall, including
Madhya Pradesh, South Karnataka, Maharashtra,
and Rajasthan.

* Suitable for crops like red gram, groundnut, and
castor seed.

9, Laterite Soil:

* Formed from a mixture of clay and red soil
through a leaching process.

¢ Rich in minerals like aluminium and iron.

* Found in hot and wet tropical areas, includ-
ing parts. of Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats, and
coastal areas.

* Low fertility, hardens upon exposure to air, used
as a building material.

* Suitable for crops like coffee, coconut, and cashew.

10, Regur Soil:

e Also known as black soil or cotton soil, found in
the Deccan Trap region.

¢ Rich in nutrients like calcium, potassium, and
magnesium but low in nitrogen.

¢ Suitable for crops such as cotton, tobacco, oil-
seeds, and maiz

pH Levels of Soils: The questions can be linked with the
pH levels also.

1. Acidic Soils: with pH level below 7. The examples are
sandy soils and some types of peaty soils. The low pH
value is due to the leaching of basic nutrients and the
accumulation of acidic substances over time.

2. Neutral Soils: with pH level of 7. Example is loamy

soils. Soil is neither strongly acidic nor strongly alkaline.

Alkaline Soils: with pH level above 7. Example is

chalky soils which contains a large amount of chalk or

limestone. The alkaline level is due to the presence of
calcium carbonate.

°

Bad Management of Soils

Soil pollution refers to the presence of toxic chemicals,
salts, pathogens, or radioactive materials in soil at levels
harmful to plant growth, human health, and ecosystem
function. The sources of pollution include the following:

}. Deforestation Impact: Deforestation disrupts the
soil ecosystem, leading to adverse effects on soil
health and fertility. So, this must be avoided.

2. Soil Compaction: The use of heavy machinery cg
compact the soil, reducing its porosity and wate
holding capacity.

3. Sewage Water and Heavy Metals: Irrigating fielq
with sewage water or using sewage sludge as fertilize
can increase the heavy metal content in the soil.

4. Crop Rotation Importance: Intensive agricultuy,
practices, without crop rotation, can deplete spec
nutrients from the soil over time.

5. High-Yielding Varieties and Resources: High,

yielding crop varieties often demand more water ang
fertilizers, impacting soil and resource use. Punjab,
Haryana and parts of UP already suffered, there ara

intensive agriculture practices which spoil the land,
6. Salinity and Waterlogging: The use of water wit
high salt content can lead to soil salinity, making th
topsoil impermeable and causing waterlogging issue

7. Pesticides and Fertilizers: Excessive use of pesti.
cides and fertilizers to boost land productivity can.
degrade soil quality and introduce these chemicals

into the ecosystem.
8. Groundwater Overexploitation: Overexploitation

of groundwater can lead to a declining water table.

and contribute to desertification.

health issues.
¢ Loss of biodiversity

* Climate change: This may happen due to release of

greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Prevention of Soil Pollution

1. Sustainable Agricultural Practices: There should be

organic farming methods, rotating crops, and reduc-
ing the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

2. Proper Waste Disposal: To ensure safe disposal and
treatment of industrial and municipal waste.

3. Soil Remediation Techniques: This includes meth-
ods such as bioremediation, phytoremediation, and
soil washing to remove contaminants.

4. Legislation and Policies: Implementing and enforc-

ing environmental regulations to control the dis-

charge of pollutants into the soil.
5. Public Awareness and Education: Informing the

public about the importance of soil conservation and

ways to prevent soil pollution.
6. Industrial Process Modification: Adopting cleanef

production techniques and pollution control mea"

sures in industries.
7. Deforestation Prevention: This maintains soil struc”

Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP)

POPs are persistent, synthetic organic pollutants.
Some POP may be linked with soil pollution as they
get suitable conditions to stay there for longer dura-
tions. POP can be divided into three parts:

| Persistent means staying longer in the environment
without breaking down.

/ Organic means they are carbon based molecules
their structure may involve chlorine, fluorine, or bro-
mine. There is exposure to pesticides; herbicides etc
due to agriculture practices and also industrial wastes

Pollutants means their capability to damage nerv
ous system, immune system cause cancer etc. They
bioaccumulate and biomagnify in the food chain
because they stay longer in the trophic levels. They
are specially dangerous to high trophic levels such
as human beings as they stay in the fatty acids.

There is need for better regulations to avoid thei
intakes into the trophic levels.

impacts hearing but also raises blood pressure, impairs
cognitive function, and leads to chronic stress, affect-
ing overall health,

Measurement of Noise: Noise is measured in decibels
(dB), that was named after Graham Bell, the inventor of the
telephone. This measurement is not linear but logarithmic:

il struc- 3s: Ih 21S ar
bels (dB), which is a logarithmic scale. Every 10 dB

cially at high volumes or with prolonged exposure. ©

increase represents a tenfold increase in sound inten-
sity. For example, 70 dB is ten times more intense
than 60 dB. An increase from 40 to 80 dB signifies a
10,000-fold rise in loudness.

° Threshold of Hearing: The threshold of hearing is
the quietest sound that the average human ear can
detect, typically around 0 dB. Sounds below this level
are considered inaudible. O decibel represents the
threshold of hearing, correlating to an intensity of 1
X 10°? Watts/m?.

e Threshold of Pain: On the other end of the scale,
the threshold of pain for most people is around 120-
130 dB. Exposure to sounds at or above this level can
cause physical discomfort and hearing damage.

e Sonic Boom: An aircraft flying at or above the speed of
sound generates a shockwave known as a sonic boom.
This creates an extremely loud noise heard on the ground.

e dBA: The decibel-A scale (dBA) is used to measure
noise pollution, and it considers both the intensity
(loudness) and frequency (pitch) of sounds. The
weighting in the dBA scale is designed to mimic the
sensitivity of the human ear to different frequencies.

° Sound power: This is measured in watts (W) and rep-
resents the total energy radiated by a sound source.

As per the Environment Protection Rules, 1999, in India,
the permissible noise level is set at 125 dB. The Central
Pollution Control Board (CPCB) specifies different noise
limits for various zones, both during the day and night:

Industrial areas 75 dB 70GB
Commercial areas 65 dB 55 dB
Residential areas 55 dB 45 dB
‘Silent zones’ near 50 dB 40 dB

schools, hospitals, etc.

Hearing Loss and Masking: WHO recognizes noise as
a significant health hazard in crowded cities. Persistent
exposure to noise, even below 85 dB, can cause permanent
hearing loss, and levels around 130 dB can induce physi-
cal pain. Noise pollution also leads to ‘masking’, affecting
our ability to hear important environmental cues, and can
cause heart rate and breathing pattern changes, irritabil-
ity, headaches, sleeplessness, and decreased productivity.

tive substances in the environment, which can be harm-
ful to living organisms and the ecosystem. Radiation, the
transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles
through space or a material medium, is categorized into
ionizing and non-ionizing types.

fonizing Radiation

¢ Includes high-energy radiation like X-rays and gamma
rays.

® Can alter DNA and is harmful due to its ability to ion-
ize atoms and molecules.

e Sources include medical procedures (such as X-rays,
CT scans, and nuclear medicine), nuclear power
plants, and natural sources like cosmic rays and radon
gas from the earth’s crust.

Non-ionizing Radiation
e Low-energy radiation emitted by devices like mobile
phones or radio towers.
e Primarily generates heat and is generally considered

less harmful, but long-term exposure and high inten-
sities may have health implications.

Sources of Radiation

¢ Most radiation exposure is natural, with radon gas
being a prominent example.

e Human-made sources typically account for about
20% of average radiation exposure.

Environmental waste refers to materials that are discarded
after use and are harmful to the environment. According
to the Environment Protection Act, 1990, waste includes
any scrap material or unwanted substance arising from
any process. The Ministry of Environment and Forests
(MoEF) implements India’s Hazardous Wastes Rules.

This term encompasses a wide range of waste types,

each with unique environmental impacts.

e

The list of wastes includes solid waste, liquid waste,
biodegrade able waste, E-Waste and so on. ;
The environmental Impacts includes pollution,
resource depletion, GHG emissions, habitat destruc-
tion as the most important ones. ;

Their management and mitigation includes the poli-
cies of reduce, reuse and recycle, their proper disposal
and innovation in waste management. The new tech-
nologies have been developed for these.

In legislation, the Directive Principles of State Policy
in the Indian Constitution (Article 47) mandate envi-
ronmental protection.

The rapid urbanization and population growth pose
significant waste management challenges. As on date,

9.48

only 68% of garbage is collected in India, with just
28% treated.

° ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ launched in 2014 focuses on
waste management, cleanliness, and sanitation.

Types of Waste

1. Biodegradable Waste: Includes food residue and
human excreta, degradable through microbial activity.

2. Non-biodegradable Waste: Includes persistent
materials like petroleum, plastic, and glass.

3. Biomedical Waste: Comprises medical waste like
needles, syringes, and body parts.

4. e-Waste: Consists of electronic items like computers,
batteries, and CFL bulbs.

Sources of Waste: The sources of waste have been
divided into the following categories:

1. Domestic Waste: This includes polythene, bottles,
food scraps, cotton, etc.
2. Industrial Waste: This originates from various indus-

trial activities and can be categorized as follows:

* Food Processing: Contains organic wastes and
pathogens.

e Paper Industry: Includes substances like chlo-
rine, sulfur dioxide, and methyl mercaptan.

e Textile Industry: Arises from the boiling and pro-
cessing of fibers.

¢ Petroleum Industry: Contains inorganic sul-
phur, hydrocarbons, organic acids, etc.

¢ Chemical Industry: Contains substances like
phosphorus, fluorine, and silica.

° Metal Industry: Includes metals such as copper,
lead, chromium, and cadmium.

* Cement Industry: Generates particulate matter
and dust.

e Nuclear Reactors: Produce radioactive wastes,
including plutonium.

3. Agricultural Waste: Includes waste from farming
activities, such as fertilizer, crop residues, pesticides,
and fumigants.

4. Radioactive Waste: Originates from sources like
X-ray machines, nuclear plants, laboratories, etc.

5. Municipal Waste: Generated by public offices, parks,
shops, and other urban areas.

Soup Waste Disposa. MetHops

After the collection of municipal waste from households,
municipal authorities employ three primary disposal
methods:

1. Composting Units:

* Composting is a sustainable process that trans-
forms waste into valuable organic input, enhanc-
ing soil vitality, root growth, and soil moisture
retention.

¢ The objective is to collect organic waste exclusively.

‘2. Biomethanation: Biomethanation involves the pro-
duction of biogas from organic waste.

3. Heat Energy Recovery: Recovering heat energy
in the form of dry fuels from combustible wag;
fractions.

Types of Composting Units

Composting units can be categorized into the followin,
methods: :

1. Aerobic Composting:

e This involves the bacterial conversion of organic.

in solids under the presence of air, hot, and mo

conditions.

¢ This produces compost (humus) that serves g
odourless and pathogen-free fertilizer.

e This reduces waste volume by 50-85%.

e This can be carried out using either manual oy
mechanical means. :

2. Vermicomposting:
° This relies on the joint action of earthworms an
aerobic microorganisms.
e This produces fine, odourless, granular wor
castings, which can be used as biofertilizers in
agriculture.
3. Anaerobic Digestion:
e This occurs when organic waste is buried in pit
under partially anaerobic conditions. ue
e Anaerobic microorganisms break down the waste
releasing methane and carbon dioxide.
e The remaining organic residue becomes valuabl
manure.
e Although slower than aerobic composting, §it
occurs naturally in landfills.
* This can lead to energy recovery through biogas
generation, containing. 55-60% methane, suit-
able for power generation. :
° Less attractive in India due to high moisture and
organic content, along with the low calorific value
of the waste.
° Challenges, such as those faced by the Lucknow
biomethanation plant in 1990, highlight the
importance of designing facilities to handle mixed
waste effectively.

The other strategies have been discussed below:

1. Incineration: This process involves burning waste at
high temperatures, where the 80-90% volume reduc-
tion takes place. The generated heat can be converted
into electricity or this can be directly used for heating
purpose. This can be assumed as a source of renew-
able energy.

¢ Benefit: That lies in reducing landfill space and
can handle certain types of hazardous waste.
The initial cost and maintenance of incineration
plants are high. There can be emission of GHGS _
and other pollutants. We may use advanced filter
ing systems to avoid this.



=== Page 110 ===
7)

Landfill: The waste is buried in designated areas
" known as landfills. Modern landfills are engineered
with liners and other protective measures to minimize
environmental impact.

e Risk: The decomposition of organic waste pro-
duces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Landfills
can also lead to leachate, a contaminated liquid
that can pollute groundwater and soil.

_e Management: This requires careful site selec-
tion, design, operation, and closure to minimize
environmental impact. Gas collection systems can
capture methane for energy use.

Recycling: The process involves collecting, sorting,
and processing waste materials like plastic, paper,
glass, and metals to manufacture new products.

¢ Benefits: This includes reducing the need for raw
materials, saves energy, decreases greenhouse
gas emissions, and conserves landfill space.

The main challenge lies in the fact recycling rates vary
by material and region. It requires public participa-
tion and efficient collection systems. Some materials
lose quality over recycling cycles.

Bioremediation: The process utilizes microorgan-
isms, fungi, or plants to detoxify or remove pollutants
from soil, water, or air.

° Benefits: Bioremediation helps in case of oil
spills, chemical contaminants, heavy metals,
organic pollutants etc. This can be in situ (on site)
and ex-situ (off site). This is cost effective also.
Limitations: The effective depends on the type
of pollutant, concentration, and environmental
conditions. It is generally slower than physical or
chemical methods.

ethanogenesis

thanogenesis is closely linked to the production of
jiogas, commonly known as ‘gobar gas’ in India. This is
biological process in which microorganisms, known as
ethanogens, produce methane (CH,) as a metabolic
yproduct during the decomposition of organic matter in
maerobic (oxygen-free) environments.

Methane produced through methanogenesis can be a
otent greenhouse gas and also serves as a valuable energy
ource when harnessed, such as in biogas production.

YROLYSIS

yrolysis involves the following two steps:

nverted

1. Pyrolysis. involves heating organic materials, such as
biomass (wood, crop residues, etc.) or waste materi-
als, to high temperatures. This heating is done in an
oxygen-free (anaerobic) environment to prevent com-
ace and bustion.

ste. » Then ‘decomposition’ of larger organic material hap-
reration pens into smaller ones which are the following:

if GHGs (i) Solid (Char or Biochar): A carbon-rich solid
id filter- residue remains. This can be used as a fuel or as a
soil amendment.

9.49

Gi) Liquid (Bio-oil): A dense, viscous liquid is pro-
duced, which can be refined further to produce
fuels or chemicals.

Gii) Gas (Syngas): The gaseous products include a
mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. This
syngas can be used as a fuel or as a feedstock for
producing chemicals.

Syngas can be further processed to separate and purify
the ‘hydrogen’ that can be used as a clean energy source.

Keeping in view the above discussion, there are two
waste management approaches:

¢ Centralized: Incineration, gasification, pyrolysis
° Decentralized: Biomethanation, vermicomposting

Other Suggestible Points for Solid Waste
Management

e Segregation and community participation are essen-
tial for effective waste management.

° There are two main methods of waste management:
waste reduction and recycling.

* In 2000, the Government implemented the Municipal
Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, man-
dating urban local bodies to manage waste through
collection, segregation, storage, transportation, pro-
cessing, and disposal.

° Major challenges in waste management include:

Gi) Lack of segregation at the source

Gi) Insufficient funding

(iii) Shortage of technical expertise and appropriate
institutional arrangements

(iv) Lack of public participation

° The Kasturirangan Report emphasizes the need for an
integrated waste management approach based on the
5 R’s: Reduce, Reuse, Recover, Recycle. Remanufacture

PLastic Waste

We specifically observe this issue in India but situation
improved somewhat after Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan (Clean
India Mission) was launched in 2014 by Government of
India. The main points are as follow:

i. The entire life cycle of plastics, from manufacturing to
disposal, poses a significant environmental challenge.

2. It contributes to the degradation of land, making it
unsightly and unhygienic. Plastic waste deteriorates
soil fertility and can persist in the soil for extended
periods, disrupting essential soil microbe activity.

3. Plastics have the potential to clog drains, causing
drainage issues. .

4. Plastic waste has been linked to reproductive
problems.

Release of Dioxins

° Plastic manufacturing, particularly of PVC (polyvi-
nyl chloride) can be detrimental to us. Through PVC,
there can be release of dioxins and furans, which are
very toxic and can cause cancer,



=== Page 111 ===
9.50

° As discussed, dioxins are a type of POPs are known for
their ability to remain in the environment for a long
time and accumulate in the food chain. This build-up
poses significant risks to both humans and wildlife.

e The release of these toxic substances into the atmo-
sphere exacerbates environmental pollution. Dioxins
can be transmitted to nursing infants through breast
milk. Thus, they highlight the potential harm to vul-
nerable populations. ,

International Efforts: The international community
recognized the severity of these issues and established the
Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in
2004 as an international environmental treaty to address
such persistent organic pollutants.

Piastic Waste MANAGEMENT RuLes, 2016

¢ The minimum thickness of plastic carry bags was
increased from 40 to 50 microns, and for plastic sheets
as well.

¢ This is expected to raise the cost by about 20%, reduc-
ing the tendency to provide free carry bags and poten-
tially increasing collection by waste-pickers.

¢ Rules focus on ‘Recycling’. This encourages the reuse
of plastic in various applications like road construc-
tion, waste to.oil, and waste to energy processes, aim-
ing to boost plastic recycling.

Ban on Single-Use Plastic, 2022: From July 1, 2022,
India implemented a ban on the manufacture, import,
stocking, distribution, sale, and use of certain single-use
plastic items with low utility and high littering potential.

Thickness Requirement for Carry Bags:

° Until December 31, 2022: Carry bags made of virgin
or recycled plastic must be at least 75 microns thick.

e After December 31, 2022: Thickness requirement
increases to 120 microns

Liouip Waste

Liquid Waste, which encompasses various types of waste-
water and potentially harmful substances, originates from
different sources, including residential, commercial, and
industrial areas.

° Residential: These may be referred to as black water,
primarily contain excreta and grey matter.

© Commercial: For example, restaurants, generate fats
and oils that can be managed using grease traps.

¢ Industrial: The wastewater varies as per industry,
raw materials used, and manufacturing processes.
Some industries producing hazardous compounds.
Thus, hazardous industrial wastewater treatment is
required to remove harmful substances before dis-
charge into the environment.

e Stormwater: They also contribute to liquid waste.

Characteristics of Liquid Waste

Liquid waste exhibits distinct physical, chemical, and bio-
logical characteristics:

e Physical Characteristics: They settle at the bottom -
of a container. They may be in the form of suspended —
solids which are carried in liquid flows. Their tep,.
perature is usually higher than the surroundings. The _
odours may arise due to gas generation during bjg.
degradation.

¢ Chemical Characteristics: Liquid waste containg
both organic and inorganic components.
Organic Matter: We already discussed BOD and Cop
in for this, and COD providing faster results due to
chemical oxidation.
Inorganic Matter: These include ammonia, chloride
phosphates, and metal compounds originating from
various sources, including human and animal waste
salt, fertilizers, and mining operations. ;

° Biological Characteristics: Liquid waste hosts diverse
bacteria and microorganisms originating from various ©
sources, including human waste. While many of these.
microorganisms play a beneficial role in breaking down
organic waste components, some may be pathogenic, _

TREATMENT OF SEWAGE

The sewage can be treated by a modern technique involy- |
ing three steps—primary treatment, secondary treatment
and tertiary treatment

Primary Treatment

1. Goal: Separate solids from sewage.
2. Method: Use filtration and sedimentation to physi
cally remove particles.
3. Result: Sewage with fewer solids but still contains
pathogens and organic matter.

4. Also known as: Mechanical treatment.

Secondary Treatment
1. Process: Neutralized effluents go through a reactor

called sludge.

2. Action: Anaerobic bacteria break down biodegrad-

able material, releasing odour and methane.

3. Conversion: Sewage turns into clean water.

4. Additional step: Water goes to aeration tanks, gets

air and bacteria. This is biological treatment.

Tertiary Treatment

1. Purpose: Disinfect and clean the water further.

2. Steps: Remove remaining bacteria and organic solids.

3. Methods: Use chlorination, evaporation, and
exchange absorption.

4. Outcome: Obtain clean water

Water treatment methods can be categorized into physi-
cal, chemical, and biological methods. Here’s a simplifie
overview with examples:

Coagulation/Mixing: This adds coagulants (like
_jron or aluminium salts) to water, distributing them
evenly through rapid mixing. This prepares particles
for removal.

Flocculation: This forms larger particles from desta-
bilized smaller ones, making them easier to remove
by sedimentation (settling) or flotation.

particles (like oil) to the surface for removal.
Filtration: This uses a filter medium with varying
pore sizes to remove solid particles from a liquid.
Sedimentation: This uses gravity to settle suspended
solids in water.

“HEMICAL MeTHoos

4. Precipitation: Effective for removing heavy metals
from wastewater, often using hydroxide or sulphide
precipitation.

9. Adsorption: Uses a solid (like activated carbon) to
remove soluble substances, especially organic impuri-
ties, from water.

3. Disinfection: Adds chemical disinfectants (like chlo-
rine) to kill remaining microbes after filtration.

IOLOGICAL TREATMENT

1. Aerobic Treatment: Uses oxygen to break down
organic compounds, with mechanical devices provid-
ing continuous oxygen mixing.

2. Anaerobic Treatment: Utilizes bacteria to treat
industrial wastewater, reducing sludge volume and
producing methane gas.

aste Stabilization Ponds. (WSPs): These are also
own as lagoons or sewage lagoons. WSPs make use of
un’s energy, algae, and bacteria to break down organic
atter and remove pathogens from wastewater. They
are a cost-effective and sustainable solution for treating
_wastewater in rural and developing areas.

‘olychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)

¢ Properties: PCBs are heavy, syrupy hydrocarbons,
non-conductive, water-insoluble, and highly stable at
high temperatures.

Uses: Previously used in manufacturing electrical
components.

Ban and Risks: PCBs were banned in 1979 due to
links with. cancer and developmental problems. PCBs
accumulate in fat and become more dangerous up the
food chain.

Presence: Found in warehouses, landfills, rivers, and
hazardous waste sites.

Control Measures: The Environmental Protection
Agency’s Superfund Program was established to man-
age and control PCB contamination.

Biomepica. Waste Manacement (BMW)

® BMW is a waste from medical diagnosis, treatment,
ndrags immunization of humans or animals, research activities,
ints. production/testing of biologicals, and health camps.

Flotation: This uses gas bubbles to carry hydrophobic

9.51

¢ Principles: Emphasizes the 3Rs - reduce, recycle, and
reuse. Aims to avoid waste generation and promote
recovery over disposal.

¢ Hazardous vs Non-Hazardous: Typically, 10-25% of

.  BMWis hazardous; the rest is non-hazardous.

° WHO Guidelines: Introduced ‘The Blue Book’ in
1999, revised in 2014, for safe BMW disposal.

° International Agreements:

(i) Basel Convention: Global treaty on hazardous
wastes.

Gi) Stockholm Convention (2006): Addresses pol-
lutants from medical waste incinerators.

(iii) Minamata Convention (2014): Phases out mer-
cury-containing medical equipment.

e Regulations: Biomedical Waste (Management &
Handling) Rules, 1998, under the Environment
(Protection) Act, 1986, mandate segregation, treat-
ment, and disposal based on colour codes.

Hazarpous Waste

This is any kind of waste that poses a threat to health or
the environment due to its physical, chemical, reactive,
toxic, flammable, explosive, or corrosive characteristics.

Common Contaminants in Hazardous Waste

1. Electronic Waste: Contains harmful elements like
cadmium, lead, and PVC sheathing on cables.

2. Household Chemicals: Includes bleach, oven clean-
ers, turpentine, and paints.

3. Products with Nanoparticles: Often found in sun-
screens, cosmetics, and skin gels, containing zinc and
titanium oxide.

4. Commercial/Industrial Waste: Characterized by a
range of chemicals and heavy metals.

5. Construction/Demolition Waste: Notably contains
asbestos.

6. Biosolids: Particularly sewage sludge, outside of
standard waste streams.

India faces many legal and regulatory challenges in man-
aging hazardous waste. Others are financial constraints,
staff shortages, lack of standardized protocols, and insuf-
ficient legal authority, despite having a comprehensive
legal and regulatory framework in place.

e-Waste (ELectronic Waste)
This can be classified into the following three:

1. White Goods: Household appliances.

2. Brown Goods: TVs, camcorders.

3. Grey Goods: Computers, printers, fax machines,
scanners, etc.

¢ Legislation: e-Waste (Management) Amendment
rules were enacted in. 2018. Earlier, the E-waste (Man-
agement and Handling) Rules, 2011, emphasized
producer and consumer responsibility for disposal.
The E-waste (Management) Rules, 2016, introduced
options for manufacturers, including refundable
deposits and paying for goods return.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)

EPR is the responsibility of producers for the environmentally
sound management of their products until the end of their
life. This principle is meant to encourage producers to con-
sider the environmental impact of their products throughout
the product lifecycle, including post-consumer waste. :

¢ Global e-Waste Monitor: According to one Tepor
82% of e-waste is from personal devices, with only

We begin our discussion with the natural process, then we
move towards the natural causes and anthropogenic causes
o that our discussion is complete in the context.

_ Historical Foundation

® 1824 - Joseph Fourier discovered the process of for-
mation of GHG.

° 1827 and 1838 - Claude Pouillet showed how the
atmosphere absorbs more heat from the Earth than
the Sun.

* 1856 - Eunice Newton Foote identifies the role of
water vapor in enhancing the greenhouse effect.

© 1859 - John Tyndall measured how gases such as car-
bon dioxide and water vapor absorb infrared radiation.

Process of the Greenhouse Effect

e Solar Radiation: The Sun emits shortwave radiation,
passing through Earth’s atmosphere and absorbed by
the Earth’s surface.

° Earth’s Emission: Earth then radiates this energy
back as longwave (infrared) radiation.

e Role of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs): Greenhouse gases
inthe atmosphere absorb some of this longwave radiation
and re-emit itin all directions, including backto Earth.

Heat Trapping and Blanket Effect

e Heat Trapping: This re-emission of longwave radia-
tion back to Earth is what traps heatin the atmosphere.

e Natural Warming: Without this effect, Earth’s aver-
age temperature would be about -18°C.

e Enhancement by Greenhouse Gases: The green-
house effect raises Earth’s average temperature by
approximately 33°C, leading to a more hospitable
average surface temperature of around 14-15°C.

e Blanket Effect: GHGs act like an atmospheric blan-
ket, absorbing and re-emitting infrared radiation,
which plays a crucial role in maintaining Earth’s
temperature. This heat trap function of GHGs is
termed the ‘blanket effect.’

Human Impact and Global Warming

e Anthropogenic Influence: Human activities since
the 1850s, notably the industrial revolution, have
greatly increased GHGs’ concentrations, enhancing
the greenhouse effect.

e Resulting Temperature Rise: This anthropogenic
enhancement has led to a noticeable increase in
Earth’s average temperature, contributing to global
warming and ongoing climate change.

Global Warming Potential (GWP): GWP is a measure to
compare the impact of different greenhouse gases relative
to CO,, based on how much energy the emissions of 1 ton
of a gas will absorb over a specific period.

* Importance: It is essential for understanding the rel-
ative impact of various gases on global warming.

imate Change

This refers to significant, long-term changes in aver-
age weather patterns over periods ranging from
decades to millions of years. Climate change can
affect specific regions or the entire planet.
paleoclimatology studies ancient climates using data
from ice cores, tree rings, sediment, coral, shells, and
rocks.

Global Warming (GW)

GW is the gradual increase in Earth’s near-surface air
and ocean temperatures, observed prominently in
recent decades.

Primary Cause: Largely due to human activities like
burning fossil fuels and deforestation, leading to an
increase in heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere.

Impact: Leads to altered weather patterns, forming a
significant aspect of climate change. The terms ‘global
warming’ and ‘climate change’ are closely related but
distinct.

auses of Climate Change

The causes have been divided into two parts — natural and
nthropogenic.

\JATURAL CAUSES

ach of the natural phenomena plays a crucial role in
haping Earth’s climate. Understanding them is vital in
he study of both past and present climatic changes.

1. Continental Drift

* Continental drift is the gradual movement of
Earth’s continents over geological time.

¢ Pangaea Breakup: This has been discussed under
earthquakes in natural hazards.

* Impact on Climate: The movement of continents
affects ocean currents and atmospheric circula-
tion patterns, which in turn influence climate.
For instance, when continents move closer to the
poles, they become covered with ice, reflecting
more sunlight and affecting global temperatures.

Volcanic Activity

* Volcanoes emit sulphur dioxide (SO,), water
vapor, dust, and ash into the atmosphere.

* Cooling Effect: These particles, especially sul-
phur dioxide, can reach the stratosphere where
they combine with water to form aerosols. These
aerosols reflect sunlight back into space, leading
to a cooling effect on the planet’s surface.

¢ Historical Examples: Significant volcanic erup-
tions, like Mount Pinatubo in 1991, have been
followed by measurable decreases in global
temperatures.

te! The global warming level has reached 418 parts per million (ppm), compared to 280 ppm in the pre-industrial

3. Earth’s Tilt and Orbit

¢ The Earth is tilted at an angle of about 23.5° rela-
tive to its orbit around the sun. This tilt causes the
seasonal variations we experience.

e Orbital Changes: Additionally, Earth’s orbit is
slightly elliptical, causing variations in the distance
between the Earth and the sun over the year.

¢ Climatic Impact: Variations in Earth’s tilt and
orbit over thousands of years (Milankovitch
cycles) can lead to significant long-term climate
changes, such as ice ages and interglacial periods.

4, Ocean Currents

¢ Solar Radiation Absorption: Oceans cover about
71% of Earth’s surface and absorb a large amount
of solar radiation.

¢ Heat Distribution: Ocean currents act as a global
conveyor belt, distributing heat around the planet.
For example, the Gulf Stream carries warm water
from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Atlantic,
influencing the climate of Western Europe.

* Climate Influence: These currents can signifi-
cantly affect climate patterns. Changes in ocean
currents can lead to climate changes such as the
El Nifio and La Nifia phenomena.

Anthropogenic Causes (Human Causes): These have
been discussed separately in the earlier parts also.

° Urbanization and Industrialization: These are
powered by fossil fuels, contributing significantly to
global warming and climate change.

° Electricity Production: Mainly generated from coal-
fired thermal power plants, which are major sources
of greenhouse gas emissions.

Errects of Cuimare CHANGE AND GLOBAL

WARMING

The effects of climate change and global warming are
extensive and varied, impacting nearly every aspect of the
Earth’s environment and human life.

Cyclonic Storms

e Increased Storm Activity: There is notable rise in
both the frequency and intensity of tropical storms in
recent years.

e Formation Mechanism: These storms develop due
to ocean water evaporation and are influenced by the
Coriolis effect, which causes them to spin.

e Cyclones or Hurricanes: When such storms reach
wind speeds over 119 km/h, they are classified ‘as
hurricanes.

e Ice Storms: These occur when precipitation falls as
ice, often due to specific atmospheric conditions.

Loss of Biodiversity

e Habitat Destruction: A significant impact is the loss
of habitats, essential for countless species.



=== Page 117 ===
9,56

1. Forest Ecosystems: Around 70% of land animals
and plants reside in forests, and deforestation
leads to biodiversity loss and species extinction.

2. Forest Value: Forests are crucial for biodiver-
sity, wildlife habitat, and medicinal resources.
Deforestation risks losing unique genetic
resources.

3. Species Extinction Rates: Reports suggest that
up to 50,000 species are lost each year, a concern
raised during the 1992 Earth Summit.

Sea-Level Rise and Ocean Changes

¢ Ocean’s Role in Climate: Oceans absorb CO,, miti-

gating atmospheric CO, levels, but increased CO,
leads to ocean acidification.

¢ Warming Effects: Rising ocean temperatures affect
their ability to absorb CO, and lead to thermal expan-
sion, contributing to sea-level rise.

e Melting of Ice: Melting glaciers and ice sheets further
contribute to rising sea levels.

® Ocean Circulation Changes: Potential large-scale
changes in ocean currents could occur, affecting
global climate patterns.

Coral Reefs Bleaching

¢ Importance of Coral Reefs: Known as ‘rainforests of
the oceans,’ they provide diverse habitats and protect
coastlines.

° Impact of Warming Oceans: Increased sea tem-
peratures and changes in water conditions lead to
decreased photosynthesis in algae, essential for coral
health. This results in coral bleaching, where corals
lose color and vitality.

Additional Marine Impacts

* Polar Ice Melting: Affects marine ecosystems and sea
levels. ,

° Fish Migration: Changes in ocean temperatures lead
to shifts in marine species distribution.

Overall, climate change and global warming have diverse
and profound impacts on the planet, affecting weather
patterns, ecosystems, biodiversity, and marine life.

OtTHer Key DEVELOPMENTS

1. 1896-Arrhenius’ Fossil Fuel Warning: Svante
Arrhenius predicts that burning fossil fuels could
enhance global warming. He notes that only half of
CO, emissions are naturally absorbed, with the rest
accumulating in the atmosphere.

2. 1950-Establishment of WMO: The World
Meteorological Organization is founded in Geneva,
enhancing international cooperation in weather
reporting and related services.

3. 1950s-1960s - Aerosol Pollution and Cooling
Concerns: Smog becomes a major issue in cities,
leading to temperature drops and fears of a new Ice

. Age. The 1954 London Smog is a notable example.

apter 9

4. 1958-The Keeling Curve: Continuous measurement,

of atmospheric CO, at the Mauna Loa Observatory ;

Hawaii begin, resulting in the Keeling Curve, which.

shows rising CO, levels.

5. Revelle’s Ocean Absorption Theory: Roger Randal] -

Dougan Revelle suggests that oceans absorb cg

slower than expected, exacerbating the greenhouse -

effect.

6. 1972-Stockholm Conference: The UN Conference
on Human Environment, focusing on global environ...

mental issues, is held.
7. 1975-Coining of ‘Global Warming’: Wallace 5
Broecker is the first to use the term ‘global warming.
8. 1979-First World Climate Conference: This confer.

ence in Geneva begins a series of global discussions

on climate change.

9. 1983-Brundtland Commission Formation:

The UN’s World Commission on Environment.

and Development, later known as the Brundtland
Commission, is established to explore sustainable
development.
10. 1988-Formation of IPCC: The Intergovernmental

Panel on Climate Change is established to assess

human-induced climate change and suggest solu-
tions. It wins the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 with A]
Gore.
11. 1992-UNFCCC and Rio Summit: The United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change is created
to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations. The Rio
Summit also produces Agenda 21, a plan for sustain
able development.

Tiprinc Point anp Runaway Cuimate CHances

Tipping point logically appears before runaway climate
changes. Tipping point is a threshold point beyond which.

uncontrollable runaway changes will occur. We can play
an analogy between the term ‘tipping point’ and ‘playing
with fire’ that means that if we keep warming the Earth,
we might reach a point where big and unstoppable cli-
mate changes happen. The changes which could not be
controlled are known as runaway changes. Thus, the ini-
tial small anthropogenic aggravate into big uncontrolla-
ble changes. Thus, once tipping points are crossed, they
can lead to runaway climate change.

For Example: The melting of ice at Arctic and Antarctic
may happen after increase of temperature by 1.5 to 2°C
to reach at tipping point. That melting will cause cata-
strophic irreversible changes in the climate of earth.

Triggers of Runaway Climate Change

1. Reduced CO, Absorption: First, we need to see the
natural ability of the climate system. Oceans and ter-
restrial ecosystems (say plants) work as the primary
sinks for the absorption of CO,. That absorption
capacity plays an important role in regulating global
temperature. The absorption rate of primary sinks is
50% of total CO, emissions on earth.

In

people: Development and Environmen

, Declining Absorption and Ocean Acidification:
There is global warming due to increased GHGs. The
temperature of vast seas is also increasing. they absorb
more CO, and becoming acidic. This acidification by
formation of carbonic acids is harmful to marine life
(such as coral reefs) which actually function as lungs.
As oceans warm, they expand. Add to this the melting
of ice by glaciers and ice sheets. Sea level rise threat-
ens coastal communities and ecosystems.

_ Decreased Reflection of Sunlight:

e The retreating snow and ice expose darker ground
around polar areas and water surfaces.

e These darker areas absorb more sunlight, leading
to further warming.

4, Increased Natural Emissions of CO, and Methane:
This are linked with fossil fuels etc. and melting of per-
mafrost as discussed. Overall, sources such as soils,
forests, peatlands, oceans, permafrost, and methane
clathrates emit CO, and methane. The warmer tem-
peratures can increase these natural emissions.

india’s Vulnerabilities: As Per IPCC Reports

e The IPCC is a UN-established scientific body.

Its role is to assess climate change science and impacts.
IPCC reports emphasize rising temperatures, extreme
weather, sea-level rise, and ecological changes.

The term ‘Code Red’ in AR6 (Sixth Assessment Report)
highlights the critical stage of climate change.

* Global CO, emissions must peak by 2020 and then
decline rapidly to reach net zero around mid-century.
¢ To achieve this, global CO, emissions need to be
reduced by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and by
85-90% by 2050.

These reductions are necessary to limit global warm-
ing to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5
degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.

° This signifies immediate action necessary.

In context of India, the following findings are impor-
ant in context of AR6:

1. CVI (Climate Vulnerability Index): This report for
India builds upon the findings of AR6 to assess the
vulnerability of different regions in India to climate
ntarctic change impacts. it provides a localized analysis of
3 to 2°C the risks and helps identify areas that require urgent
se cata- adaptation measures.

th. 2. IPCC on Poverty: This report uses information from
AR6 to understand how climate change could affect
poverty. It warns that climate-related problems might
see the push many people into extreme poverty, harming
and ter their lives and incomes.

primary IPCC on Financial Needs for Adaptation: This uses
AR6 data to calculate the money needed for adap-
tation in various. countries, including India. This

amount of resources necessary for successful adapta-
tion strategies.

4. Temperature Rise and Financial Needs for Net
Zero: This statement recognizes the projections in
AR6 regarding the global temperature rise and under-
scores the financial commitments required by India to
achieve net-zero emissions. It emphasizes the impor-
tance of substantial investments in clean energy and
sustainable technologies as essential steps to combat
climate change effectively.

The Rio Summit, also known as the United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED),
was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from June 3 to 14,
1992. It was the first major international conference on
sustainable development, and it brought together over
170 heads of state and government. The summit resulted
in the adoption of three important documents:

¢ Rio Declaration on Environment and Development:
This declaration contains 27 principles. that outline
the rights and responsibilities of states in the pursuit
of sustainable development.

° Main Principle: ‘The right to development is an
inalienable human right.’

e Agenda 21: This contains over 2,000 recommen-
dations for action by governments, businesses, and
other stakeholders for sustainable development.

¢ The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD):
This international treaty aims to conserve biodiver-
sity; the sustainable use of its components, and the
fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out
of the utilization of genetic resources. This has been
discussed in the coming paragraphs.

UNFCCC Mission: United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted

during Rio Summit in 1992. UNFCCC came into force in ©

1994. There are 197 nations who ratified the convention.

The Mission of UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would
prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
climate system. In this Conference of the Parties (COP)
was adopted as a regular arrangement that is the core
decision making body. To note that all member nations of
UNFCCC are parties to the COP. Thus, UNFCCC created a
legacy, specially in the form of COPs.

REDD+

REDD+ emerged within the UNFCCC, evolving through
international discussions and negotiations. It gained
prominence in the mid-2000s; and was formally recog-
nized as a climate change mechanism. It has been shaped
and refined through global climate conferences and

involves multiple countries and organizations in its imple-
mentation.

More about COP: COP makes global climate policies.
The member states come together to talk about, negoti-
ate, and organize joint efforts to tackle climate change.
Their main goals include cutting down emissions, adjust-
ing to climate change effects, capacity building, funding
and technical help to developing nations.

COP is assisted by two subsidiary bodies which provide
technical expertise and monitor implementation:

1. Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological
Advice (SBSTA) and
2. Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI)

Apart from these two, there are many adhoc working
groups to assist.

* COP decisions are usually made by consensus among
all member countries, although voting is allowed if
consensus cannot be reached.

° The parties outline their commitments to tackle
climate change through Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs).

A Quick idea About Major COPs

Several major COPs under UNFCCC have been held to
advance global environmental efforts. These include:

1. COP3 (Kyoto, 1997): The Kyoto Protocol was
adopted, committing industrialized countries to limit
and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accor-
dance with agreed individual targets. It was the first
agreement to set binding emission reduction targets
for developed countries.

COP11 (Montreal, 2005): The Montreal Action Plan
was agreed upon, marking a significant step forward
in the international climate change process, which
included detailed rules for the implementation of the
Kyoto Protocol.

3. COPIS (Copenhagen, 2009): Although it was
not considered fully successful at the time, the
Copenhagen Accord recognized the need to limit
global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius
above pre-industrial levels.

4. COP16 (Cancun, 2010): The Cancun Agreements
were a set of decisions that included formalizing miti-
gation pledges and taking note of emission reduction
targets of developed countries and actions of develop-
ing countries. ;

5. COP17 (Durban, 2011): The Durban Platform for
Enhanced Action was established, leading to a deci-
sion to develop a new legal instrument that would
apply to all countries by 2015.

6. COP21 (Paris, 2015): The Paris Agreement was a
landmark environmental accord adopted by nearly
every nation to address climate change and its nega-
tive impacts. It aims to limit global warming to well
below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared
to pre-industrial levels.

&

7. COP26 (Glasgow, 2021): This conference saw
nearly 200 countries agree to the Glasgow Climate
Pact, which aimed to accelerate action on climate
this decade. Key outcomes included commitments to.
phase down coal use, reduce deforestation, speed y
the switch to electric vehicles, and increase financial}
support for developing countries

8. COP27 (Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, 2022): This.
focused on implementing the Paris Agreement, which
aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degress
Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared
to pre-industrial levels.

9. COP 28 (United Arab Emirates, 2023): COP28
fcused on the following tasks:

(i) Era of An End of Fossil Fuel: Thus, COP28 shifteq
a clear focus towards renewable energy sources.
There is world’s first ‘global stocktake’ to intensify
climate action before 2030. The aim is to keep the
global temperature rise within 1.5°C. It includes
commitments to cut global greenhouse gas emis.
sions by 43% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels,

(ii) EnhancedNationally Determined Contributions
(NDCs): Parties are encouraged to submit more
ambitious NDCs by 2025, covering all greenhouse
gases and sectors, aligned with the 1.5°C goal.

(iii) Loss and Damage Fund: There was a historic agree.
ment on operationalizing the loss and damage fund, .
with more than USD 700 million pledged, providing
financial support to countries most affected by cli-.
mate change. There was focus on Santiago Network |
for Loss and Damage to provide technical assistance
to countries vulnerable to climate change.

(iv) There was understanding on Global Goal on
Adaptation (GGA) and Climate Finance through
Green Climate Fund at USD 12.8 billion.

10. Future COPs: Azerbaijan is to host COP29 in 2024, .
and Brazil to host COP30 in 2025 for new climat
finance goal and updating NDCs.

Glasgow Meeting Commitments

India made the following commitments to address the
climate change and transition to a more sustainable and
environmentally friendly energy system:

1. To get 500 GW Non-fossil energy capacity by 2030
This includes renewable energy sources such as solar,
wind, hydroelectric, and nuclear power, By expand-
ing its non-fossil energy capacity, India aims to reduce
its reliance on fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse
gas emissions.

2. 50% of its energy requirements from renewable
energy by 2030: So that India aligns with its goal |
to increase the share of clean and sustainable energy
in its energy mix. This transition can contribute to a
significant reduction in carbon emissions and combat
climate change.

3. The reduction of total projected carbon emissions
by one billion tonnes from now to 2030: This reduc-
tion target signifies India’s dedication to curbing its
carbon footprint and mitigating climate change.



=== Page 120 ===
-The reduction of the carbon intensity of the econ-
omy by 45% by 2030, over 2005 levels: This means
that while the economy may continue to grow, it will
‘do so with significantly fewer carbon emissions per
unit of economic output.

To achieve the target of net zero emissions by
2070: This commitment signifies its intent to balance
the emissions it produces with removals or offsetting
measures, ultimately contributing to the global effort
-to limit global warming and its associated impacts.

ARBON IN TRADE

‘ne following discussion may help us.in the better under-
tanding of Kyoto Plan.

arbon Space: This concept refers to the idea of setting
dimit on the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions
jlowable to prevent excessive global temperature rise.
or example, if a limit of 1000 billion tons of CO2 is set
o be not exceeded by 2100, it aims to keep the Earth’s
emperature from increasing more than 2 degrees Celsius
bove pre-industrial levels. We can keep our targets and
ake better mitigation plans.

arbon Trading

arbon trading is a market-based system where compa-
ies buy and. sell emission allowances. Each allowance
ermits a certain amount of carbon dioxide to be emitted.
‘a company emits less CO, than its allowance, it can sell
he surplus to others. This system incentivizes companies
¢ reduce emissions, as they can profit from selling excess
llowances. Carbon trading is relevant for encouraging
nvironmentally friendly practices and meeting global
mission reduction goals.

There are two choices available under carbon trading:

ations (or institutions) which are not in a position to cut
own their pollution or burning more carbon can buy car-
on credits.

_ They buy these credits from countries that are doing
better at reducing pollution, like India or China. Thus, it
makes sense for us to cut down pollution or make invest-
ment in climate friendly projects. Capturing CO, before it
gets to the atmosphere.

Carbon Sink: These are reservoirs or places that hold
onto carbon for a long time. This can be done in following
two ways:

® Natural Carbon Sink: Plants take in CO, and turn it into
food through photosynthesis. The oceans also absorb
_CO,. The example is of afforestation, oceans and soil.
°. Artificial Carbon Sink: These include things like
landfills and special storage methods where carbon is
trapped and stored.

This discussion helps in the understanding of Kyoto
Protocol.

Kvoto PrRoTocoL

As discussed, this protocol was signed during the COP3 in

Kyoto, Japan. This again intends to combat global warm-
ing by reducing GHG emissions. The primary goal is to
reduce GHG emissions in the atmosphere to levels that
would prevent dangerous human interference with the
climate system. The main points are as follows:

1. Legally Binding Targets: It imposed legally binding
obligations on developed countries to reduce their
GHG emissions, aiming for an average reduction of
about 5% below 1990 levels by 2012.

2. India’s Ratification: India ratified the Kyoto Protocol
in 2002.

3. Enforcement: The Protocol came into force in
February 2005. Notably, the USA never ratified it.

4. Common But Differentiated Responsibilities
(CBDR): A key principle of the Protocol, CBDR acknowl-
edges that while all nations are responsible for address-
ing global warming, developed countries have a greater
obligation due to their historical GHG emissions.

5. Country Classifications:
¢« Annex I Nations: Includes developed nations

(such as USA, UK, France, Japan, Russia) with
binding targets for reducing emissions.

¢ Annex II Nations: A subset of Annex I, these
countries are expected to provide financial and
technical support to developing countries and
economies in transition (EITs) for emission reduc-
tion efforts.

* Non-Annex Nations: Developing countries (like
China, India, Indonesia) with no binding emis-
sion reduction commitments, but encouraged to
voluntarily manage their carbon emissions.

6. Mechanisms for Reducing Emissions:
¢ Clean Development Mechanism (CDM): Allows

developed countries to invest in emission reduc-
tion projects in developing countries and earn
carbon credits.

¢ Emission Trading (Cap and Trade): Enables
countries to buy and sell unused emission units.

¢ Joint Implementation (JI): Facilitates emission
reduction projects between Annex I countries.

7. Commitment Periods:
¢ First Period (2008-2012): Initial phase of emis-

sion reduction targets.

* Second Period (2013-2020): Extended phase
with updated targets.

Thus, Kyoto Protocol was a significant step in interna-
tional climate policy that introduced binding targets for
developed nations to mitigate climate change. However, it
could not be effective due to lack of participation of some
major emitters and the complex nature of international
emissions trading.

SEAS

The Paris Agreement, established under UNFCCC. It is a
significant international commitment aimed at combat-
ing climate change. It was adopted in 2015 with the fol-
lowing frameworks and objectives:

1. Frameworks:

* Technology Framework: Encourages develop-
ment and transfer of climate-friendly technologies.

° Capacity-Building Framework: Aims to build
capabilities, particularly in developing countries,
to meet climate challenges.

* Transparency Framework: Ensures clear report-
ing and tracking of countries’ climate actions and
support.

2. Financial Commitments: Developed countries are
required to mobilize at least $100 billion annually by

Figure 9.20 Targets for Paris Agreement

8. India’s Role: India ratified the Agreement and com-
mitted to achieving 40% of its electricity capacity from
non-fossil sources by 2030. India has also played a key
role in the International Solar Alliance (ISA), aiming to
harness solar energy for sustainable development.

Paris Agreement emphasizes collective responsibility,
transparency, and the need for financial and technologi-
cal support to combat climate change effectively.

INTERNATIONAL SOLAR ALLIANCE (ISA)

Formally ISA is not a part of the Paris Agreement but is
aligned with its goals, rather ISA is a voluntary organiza-
tion. India and Paris played pivotal role in raising ISA.

* ISA was launched at the same time as the Paris Cli-
mate Conference (COP21) in 2015, where the Paris
Agreement was negotiated.

¢ ISAaims to promote solar energy in countries between
the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. It targets 1 TW
of solar energy by 2030.

¢ However, in 2018, the scope of the ISA was expanded
to include all member states of the United Nations.

° India, hosting the ISA Secretariat, has pledged signifi-
cant contributions to solar energy development, aim-
ing for 175 GW from renewable sources by 2022. (dis-
cussed separately under Glasgow COP commitments.

2020 to support climate actions in developing coun.
tries, a figure expected to increase over time. :

3. Entry into Force: The Paris Agreement entered intg
force on 5 October 2016, marking a global effort to
address climate change.

4. Temperature Goals: The Agreement aims to limit |
global warming to well below 2°C, preferably to 1.5°¢
above pre-industrial levels.

5. Emission Reductions: It involves setting national}
determined contributions (INDCs) for reducing GHG
emissions, with a commitment to scale up efforts and
review them every five years.

6. Climate Finance: Rich nations are expected to assist
poorer nations in adapting to climate change ang
transitioning to renewable energy.

7. Structure: The Agreement is a mix of legally binding |
and non-binding provisions. While reporting require.
ments are binding, emissions targets are not. :

In this part, we discussed about the international efforts
to deal with climate change and global warming, now we
are shifting our focus towards domestic scene of India.

INCCAand NATCOM: The Indian Networkon Climate Change
Assessment (INCCA) and India’s National Communications.
(NATCOM) to UNFCCC are the key initiatives by the Ministry

of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in India.

1. INCCA: Established by the above Ministry. the INC-
CA's primary role is to conduct and promote indig-
enous research on climate change. It serves as a net-
work that brings together scientific institutions and
researchers across India to assess the impacts of cli-
mate change and develop adaptation strategies.

2. NATCOM: India’s NATCOM, launched in 2002, is a com-
prehensive report submitted to the UNFCCC. It details
the country’s actions and initiatives in addressing cli-
mate change, including mitigation and adaptation mea-
sures. This initiative is funded by the Global Environment
Facility (GEF), demonstrating India’s commitment to
international efforts in combating climate change.

NAPCCC was launched in 2008 by the Government of
India to address climate change and its impacts on the
country. The NAPCC is a comprehensive plan that outlines
eight missions to achieve India’s climate change goals.

1. Sustainable Development: with focus on economic
growth and poverty reduction are not compromised.

2. Equity: There have been issues such as North South
divide which makes as a vulnerable community.
NAPCC aims to promote a fair and equitable response.

’ 3. Precaution and Prevention: The precautionary

approach is required to prevent irreversible damage
from climate change. NAPCC emphasizes prevention
and adaptation strategies.

4. Co-benefits: There are equitable benefits to all stake-
holders from air quality improvement, energy secu-
rity, and water management.

5. International Cooperation: India recognizes the
global nature of climate change and the need for
international cooperation, and the NAPCC seeks to
promote effective partnerships and actions.

NAPCC Missions

1. National Solar Mission (NSM-2010): The main
objective of NSM was to establish India as a leader in
solar energy. The mission originally aimed to achieve
20 GW of solar power by 2022 but was later increased
to 100 GW. The mission is implemented in three
phases: Phase 1 (up to 2012-13), Phase 2 (2013-17),
and Phase 3 (2017-22), focusing on both centralized
and decentralized solar technology dissemination.

fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) have immense potential.

4. Low carbon Future: Hydrogen fuel is a zero-emission

fuel when burned with oxygen. It can be used in fue]

cells or internal combustion engines. It is also used ag g

fuel for spacecraft propulsion which shows its versatility,

| Production of Hydrogen

There are two basic methods — hydrocarbons and
| renewables.

From Hydrocarbons

1. Steam Methane Reforming: through methane
obtained from natural gas, heating that high
temperatures)

2. Partial Oxidation: oxidizing a hydrocarbon fuel |
(ike natural gas, oil, or coal)

3. Coal Gasification: Coal is converted into a gas},

(syngas), a mixture of hydrogen and carbon

monoxide. L

| From Renewables

1. Electrolysis: split water into hydrogen and oxy-@
gen, and electricity used is derived from renew-
able wind or solar power. The hydrogen pro-||
duced is considered green hydrogen. :

2. Photolysis: Directly splitting water into hydro-

gen and oxygen using sunlight. This method typ-}
ically involves using photoelectrochemical cells. |

5. Challenges to Overcome: As of now, hydrogen pro-
duction consumes more energy than it generates, that |
is called as negative net energy. There is necessity to.
bridge this efficiency gap.

6. There is need for Infrastructure and Policy
Support: This is required for hydrogen production,
storage, and distribution. :

7. Innovation and Collaboration: We need to foster global
partnerships for more research, shared technology,
investments, and collaborative research endeavours.

8. Pilot Projects: Numerous pilot projects across trans-
portation, industry, and energy sectors are underway
to validate and scale hydrogen technologies, which
will be instrumental in the mission’s progression.

Green Ammonia: Green Ammonia is a sustainable chem-
ical primarily used in producing nitrogenous fertilizers,

tributing to a carbon-neutral agricultural sector. Its
ential extends beyond agriculture, as it can serve as a
ate-friendly fuel for shipping and even power engines.
The production of green ammonia involves using hydro-
en obtained from water electrolysis, a process powered by
snewable energy sources like hydro, solar, or wind power.
itrogen, separated from the air, is then combined with
hydrogen in the Haber process to produce ammonia.

ONFERENCE ON Diversity (CBD)

BD represents a global commitment to understanding, pre-
erving, and sustainably using Earth’s precious and diverse
atural resources, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all
e forms and their roles in maintaining ecological balance.
This includes animals, plants, fungi, and microorgan-
ms. The intricate interdependence of these species in
cosystems to maintain ecological balance is important.
CBD was inspired by the world’s growing commitment
sustainable development. It was preceded by the UN
vironment’s Ad Hoc Meeting of Experts on biodiversity in
988 and further shaped during the 1992 Nairobi Conference.

. Prime Goals: These are the following three goals:

¢ Conservation of biological diversity

¢ Sustainable use of its components

¢ Fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from
genetic resources

Accordingly, CBD was opened for signature at the

1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and came into

effect in December 1993.

Biodiversity Scope: It covers all levels of biodiversity,

including ecosystems, species, and genetic resources.

While about 1.75 million species have been identi-

fied, scientists estimate the true number ranges from

3 to 100 million, highlighting the vast genetic diver-

sity within each species.

EY PROTOCOLS

BD conferences occur biennially, with significant meet-
ings including the 2012 conference in Hyderabad, India,
the 2018 UN Biodiversity Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh,
Egypt, and a meeting in Kunming, China, in 2022 which

1. Genetic Resources (GRs): GRs is basically the raw
material for many products and services, including
medicines, food, and cosmetics. The GR is linked with
BioTrade Initiative.

FairWild Standard’, linked with ABS and GR, this is a
certification scheme that ensures that wild-collected
GRs are harvested in a sustainable and ethical manner.

2. Traditional Knowledge. (TK): TK is the knowledge
that indigenous peoples and local communities have
accumulated over generations about the properties
and uses of GRs.

ABS tries to ensure that GRs and TK should share the
benefits of those resources with the countries that pro-
vide them. Those nations should be fairly compensated
for the use of their resources and knowledge.

The protocol also establishes a framework for prior
informed consent (PIC) and mutually agreed terms
(MAT), which are two important safeguards for the rights
of indigenous peoples and local communities.

The Nagoya Protocol has a number of provisions to
ensure compliance.

Aichi Biodiversity Targets Task Force (ABTTF): This
coordinates international efforts to implement the
Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, involving
various agencies and organizations like Zero Extinction,
Birdlife, CITES, FAO, GEF, IUCN, UNEP, and others. They
are the set of 20 global targets for biodiversity conserva-
tion which were adopted by CBD in 2010. For example, at
least 17% of terrestrial and inland water areas, and 10%
of coastal and marine areas. Also By 2020, to improve at
least 15% of degraded ecosystems.

Kunmine-Montreat GLoBaL BioDivERSITY
Framework (GBF)

This set of commitments is made by countries at the UN
Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in December 2022
to address the biodiversity crisis. The key drivers of the
nature crisis:

1. Changes in land and sea use: The GBF calls for a reduc-
tion in the conversion of natural habitats to agriculture
and other human uses. It also calls for the restoration of
degraded habitats. Agriculture alone is a threat to 85 per
cent of the 28,000 species at risk of extinction.
Remember Target: Protecting 30% of the planet’s
land and 30% of its marine areas by 2030.

2. Climate change: Global warming threatens as many
as one in six species at the global level. The GBF recog-
nizes that climate change is a major threat to biodiver-
sity. It calls for action to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions and to help ecosystems adapt to climate change.

3. Pollution: The GBF calls for a reduction in the use of
pesticides and other pollutants that harm biodiver-
sity. The use of pesticides is the ‘MAIN cause’ of plant
and insect decline. There is need for development of
cleaner technologies.



=== Page 125 ===
Remember Target: Reducing pesticide use by 50%
by 2030.

4, Direct exploitation of natural resources: The GBF calls
for more sustainable use of natural resources. Preventing
and reversing the degradation of land and oceans can
prevent the loss of one million endangered species.
Remember Target: Restoring 30% of degraded eco-
systems by 2030.

5. Invasive species: The GBF calls for the prevention
and control of invasive species. It also calls for the
restoration of ecosystems that have been damaged by
invasive species.

IUCN and its Different Categories

International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
was founded in 1948. Its headquarters are in Gland,
Switzerland. It is a global membership union dedicated
to the conservation of nature and the sustainable use of
natural resources. It works with governments, civil soci-
ety organizations, businesses, and indigenous peoples to
develop and implement solutions to the most pressing
environmental challenges.

IUCN Categories include Extinct,. Endangered,
Vulnerable, etc. India’s rich biodiversity is under threat
due to various anthropogenic activities, including habitat
loss, poaching, and pollution. IUCN Red List of Threatened
Species categorizes species facing a high risk of extinction
as Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable. As
of 2023, India’s endangered species list includes 38 birds,
18 amphibians and reptiles, and 81 mammals.

The examples of endangered species include the following:

1. Birds: These include Great Indian Bustard, Indian
Grey Hornbill, Western Ghats Laughingthrush,
White-bellied Heron, Slender-billed Vulture.

2. Amphibians and Reptiles: These include Indian
Narrow-mouthed Frog, Jerdon’s Tree Frog, Malabar
Pit Viper, Indian Crocodile, Hawksbill Turtle.

3. Mammals: These include Indian Wild Ass, Asiatic
Elephant, Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros, Snow
Leopard, Hangul

There is an urgent need of conservation efforts to pro-
tect India’s unique biodiversity. The main conservation
initiatives undertaken focus on habitat protection, anti-
poaching measures, community engagement, and scien-
tific research to ensure the long-term survival of these
threatened species.

Red Data Book: This is developed by IUCN. This is a list
of species that are threatened with extinction. This is used
to raise awareness of the plight of threatened species and
to help countries prioritize conservation efforts. This is
linked with CBD in respect of conservation of biodiversity
in respect of developing national biodiversity strategies,
threatened species, protecting habitats and so on.

As vedic education became highly ritualistic, there was shift
towards Buddhism with focus on ‘Middle Way’ and Anatta
(no-self) and Jainism with focus on extreme non-violence
and asceticism. There were social and economic changes,
with focus on ethics and morality. There was need to address
the issues of broader population. Further, they were sup-
ported by royal patronage from Emperor Ashoka.

We owe a lot to Indians who taught us how to count with-
out which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have
made.

— Albert Einstein

¢ There were ancient systems of education in Egypt,
China, Greece, Mesopotamia and other parts of the
world. China was popular for Confucian system of
teachings. There were many common points and
distinctions. Indian Ancient system made significant
contributions in fields like mathematics (concept of
zero, decimal system), medicine (Ayurveda), astron-
omy, and linguistics (Sanskrit grammar), There was
focus on hoilistic development, ethics and morality.
We may try to have a grasp of certain facts.

© Ancient Indian education, starting around 5000 years
ago with the Vedas, significantly shaped Indian cul-
ture. This system was more than just basic learning; it
promoted deep understanding and spiritual insight.

* Vedic education was essentially secular and included
extensive teachings in science and arts. It was holistic,
integrating the development of the mind, body, and spirit.

* Over time, Buddhism and Jainism emerged in India,
leading to the establishment of globally renowned
universities like Nalanda and Vikramshila. This era
marked India as JagatGurw’ (says — Global Mentor),
drawing students from various regions to its centers of
learning. There is mention of Jagat Guru in National
Education Policy - 2020 as well.

° In ancient India, diverse ideas and learning methods
coexisted, with people contemplating them in differ-
ent ways. This education system was equitable, treat-
ing all knowledge areas with equal importance.

© Inthis unit, we will take a full view of education, start-
ing from ancient education to modern education.

EVOLUTION OF ANCIENT EDUCATION

The term ‘Veda’ (4) originates from ‘Vid’ meaning
‘knowledge.’ Vedas symbolize boundless knowledge and
are regarded as limitless. Ancient Indian education was
shaped by religious, political, and economic influences.
In ancient Indian philosophy, ‘dharma’ (+4) had a wide-
ranging meaning, encompassing ideals, practices, and
behaviours that define the righteous path. In Unit 6, we
touched upon many facts.

Vedic Period (1500-500 BcE)

° Vedas and Upanishads (a@ sit safiaa): During
this period, the Vedas, ancient India’s oldest religious
and philosophical texts, were composed. The Upani-
shads, explaining the Vedas’ philosophical ideas, also
emerged.

e Epic Period (Heentet aie): This era witnesseg
the creation of epic texts like the Ramayana and
Mahabharata, which includes the Bhagavad Gita. Te
was also marked by the rise of Jainism and Buddhism
and the codification of Manu Smriti.

° Sutra Period (Ga @i1e): This period saw the develop.
ment of significant texts like Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras:
Gautama’s Nyaya, and the Mimamsa Shastras. 7

° Rise of Mahayana Buddhism (Herat aheg ent aq
sea): Nagarjuna (AMM) played a pivotal role in this
era, marking the rise of Mahayana Buddhism.

° Scholastic Period ( wre): This period’s key
contributions include Shankaracharya’s (afaraRs)
work and the development of the Vedanta Philosophy,

* Post-900 CE: The rise of Vedantic schools such as
Visishtadvaita and Dvaita (fafssiga sik $4) charac.
terized this period.

Two Dimensions of Knowledge: There are following two
aspects of knowledge:

Para Vidya (aa faeir): Para Vidya in education is
about attaining higher knowledge and spiritual wisdom.
Its supreme goal is to help individuals realize their union
with the Absolute God and recognize the divine essence
within themselves.

Apara Vidya (stat faa): Apara Vidya, on the other
hand, focuses on lower or secular knowledge. It encom-
passes the practical and worldly aspects of life, often,
referred to as materialistic elements that contribute to a

comfortable existence. This includes various secular sci- ben
ences and disciplines. ,

5. Personal Development: Education focused on devel- sage
oping the individual’s personality, considering both tion

inner qualities and external behaviours.

6. Inner Progression: It was seen as a journey towards
self-fulfillment.

7. Teaching Techniques: Teachers used specific meth-
ods to help students understand concepts.

8. Mental Training: Education involved training the
mind to enhance creativity.

9. Mind Over Subject: More emphasis was placed on
developing the mind than on the subjects studied.



=== Page 129 ===
_ societal Responsibility: Students learned to devote
” themselves to the greater good of humanity.

- Chitta Vritti Nirodh (fara gfa Friter): This concept
"involves controlling mental activities related to the
material world.

. Importance of Action (karma - #4): The doctrine of
» action was significant.

vocational Training: There were 64 different arts
and professions taught. Training was hands-on under
a master, often with free boarding.

‘Rta’ GRA) in Education: This term meant natural

and moral order in the Vedic context.

. Curriculum Design: The design of what to teach was

crucial.

. Oral Learning: Initially, knowledge was passed down

orally. Later, texts and a broader range of subjects

were included.

17. Practical World Knowledge: Students learned about
the world and society, aiming to experience the

Supreme Truth themselves.

. Renunciation of Materialism: Acquiring education

often meant giving up material wealth and comforts.

.Gurukulas and Ashrams (east ait ssa):
Students stayed in these educational institutions,

often in tough conditions near rivers or lakes.

20. Application of Knowledge: The aim was to use skills

and knowledge for personal growth and societal

benefit.

EpucaTioN THOUGH Mopes oF TRANSMISSION

In Indian scriptures, texts are broadly classified into two
tegories: Shruti and Smriti. This classification is based
on the method of their transmission and the nature of
their composition.

1. Shruti( aqfet): This can be simplified as revealed texts,

that is what is being divinely heard.

° The Four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva)
and the 108 Upanishads fall under the Shruti
category.

° Shruti texts are regarded as the core scriptures of
vedantic system, they hold the highest authority.
They are believed to be the timeless and eternal
knowledge revealed to ancient sages (Rishis).

. Smriti (zafa): This may be termed as remembered
texts. These texts are considered to be authored by
sages based on their understanding and interpreta-
tion of Shruti.

® This category includes a wide range of texts such
as the Bhagavad Gita, the 18 Puranas, Kautilya’s
Arthashastra, Vatsyayana’s Kama Sutra, various
Tantras, and many more.

° They provide more practical and detailed elabo-
rations on the philosophical principles found in
Shruti. They include laws, rituals, ethical codes,
and narratives that guide the social and religious
practices of Vedic system.

EpucaTION Process

In ancient India, the education process was well-struc-
tured and consisted of several important stages

1. Vidyarambha (faamest): The education began at the
age of 5. This stage marked the initiation of formal
learning.

2. Upanayana (Seat):

This was the formal education ceremony, also
known as the sacred thread ceremony.

e In the Guru’s home, the learner experienced a
second birth, becoming a ‘Dvija’ (iss), which
means ‘twice-born’.

e The first birth is from the biological parents, and
the second is from the spiritual master and Vedic
knowledge.

° This stage typically started between the ages of 8
and 12. During this phase, the student was called

a ‘Brahmacharin’ (seait4), denoting a period of
celibacy and study.

° After completing their education, a Brahmacharin
could become a ‘Grihasta’ (TERI), or householder.

e ‘Brahm Sangh’ (#é Wt) was an opportunity for
students to acquire higher knowledge. The timing
of this ceremony varied among castes.

3. Study in Gurukul (eqet): The students typically
studied in the Gurukul for about 12 years.

e After this period, they were allowed to return
home, and the Guru provided them with final
instructions.

e The completion of this phase was marked by the
‘Samavartan Sanskar’ ( GER), a ritual
signifying the end of formal education.

4. Fees and Gurudakshina (a{eafarom):
° There was hardly any interference by ruling class
in the payment of fees.
e The concept of ‘dignity of labour’ was encouraged,
with students often working hard in various tasks.
e At the end of their education, students offered
‘surudakshina’, a token of gratitude or acknowl-
edgment to their teacher.
As per another perspective, the educational process
involved three basic stages:

1. Sravana (3Ta&01): This refers to acquiring knowledge
by listening, especially to the ‘shrutis’.

2. Manana (14): The students reflected on and ana-
lyzed what they had learned, assimilating the lessons
and drawing their own inferences.

3. Nididhyasana (fafgeare ): This stage involved com-
prehending the truth and applying it in real life, a
kind of reflective stage.

Susvects in Vepic EpucaTion

12. Shastrartha (gmetad ): Engaging in learned debates.

Vedic education took a comprehensive approach, often
requiring long years of study to master a single Veda, and
graduates were called ‘Snatka’ (@d#). The graduation
ceremony was known as ‘Samavartana’ (Wadd). This
system covered a wide range of subjects, blending practi-
cal skills with philosophical and spiritual teachings.

Vepic Eoucation

We are taking a brief picture of oldest vedic texts as a

° Acknowledgment of Vedas: Upanishads, Smritis
and Puranas all recognize the supremacy of the Vedas.

Number of Vedas: There are four Vedas.
(i) Rigveda (3e): One of the oldest texts, con.
taining hymns and praises to various deities and
natural forces. It’s crucial for understanding the
religious and cultural practices of ancient India.
(ii) Yajurveda (ayaa): This Veda combines prose
and poetry, mainly associated with ritual per
formances, particularly Yagya rituals. It provides _
instructions for these ceremonies.
(iii) Samaveda (aTAae): Known for its emphasis on
musical elements, the Samaveda consists of mel.
odies and chants used in religious rituals and is
linked to the hymns of the Rigveda.
(iv)Atharva Veda (314444): Diverse in content, ©
focusing more on everyday life aspects, including _
medicine, science, and philosophy. it’s known for.
its collection of spells and incantations.

e The Rig Veda, also called as Rig Veda Samhitaa (col-
lection of vedas - #4 HfeM), marks the beginning of
formal education. This period saw the institutional-
ization of rituals, leading to two key developments:
G@) The emergence of gods with distinct powers.

(ii) The rise of a specialized priestly class (that might
have cause estrange among common people).

Stages of Vedic Education

* Early Learning: Initially, education focused
on memorizing sacred texts like the Vedas and
dharamshastras (T4311).

* Advanced Learning: Later, the curriculum
expanded to include grammar, logic, metaphys-
ics, and other allied subjects, emphasizing criti-
cal thinking (faa4 -‘chintan’) and intellectual
development.

Components and Focus of Vedic Education:

(i) Encompassed teachings from _ sutras
Brahmanism.

(ii) The primary focus was on the mind, with oral
teaching and mental exploration being key
methods. ,

(iii) The Brahman Sangh played a crucial role, provid-
ing meritorious students the opportunity to deive
deeper into intellectual pursuits. ,

(iv) Figures like Lord Buddha employed storytell-
ing to effectively convey complex teachings and
principles.

Women in households often learned music, dancing etc.
which were key cultural skills of the time.

» From Rituals to Knowledge: Ancient Indian edu-
cation evolved from the Brahmanas ( iS - ritual-
focused) to the Upanishads (aM #1 - knowledge-
focused), transitioning from ritual practices to
seeking deeper understanding.

« Aranyaka Phase: The Aranyaka (SR°4) period was
a bridge from the practical Brahmanas to the philo-
sophical Upanishads. It marked a shift from societal
roles to contemplative life, often in forests, for the
elderly.

¢ Forest Retirement: Elderly retiring to forests symbol-
ized a journey back to roots and a quest for wisdom,
representing a spiritual and philosophical exploration
beyond mere physical relocation.

1. Upanayana Ceremony (Saat WEAN): This vital
Vedic ritual marking the commencement of formal
education for women.

2. Types of Educated Women:
* Sadyodwahas ): These women pursued

studies until marriage, after which their formal
education typically concluded.

° Brahmavadinis (a@atfeit): In contrast to
Sadyodwahas, Brahmavadinis chose not to marry,
dedicating their lives to ongoing education and
scholarly endeavors.

Women studied the Vedas and Vedangas, showing their

engagement in religious and philosophical education.

They often recited hymns necessary for Yajnas (4a) and

other ritualistic activities during rituals (178M). We can
take prominent examples of _rishikas (aivent) such as
Maitreyi (eri) and Gargi (iri), who were esteemed for
their wisdom and scholarly contributions.

Shift from Vedic System towards Buddhism and
Jainism: The Vedas, somehow indirectly influenced the
emergence of Buddhism and Jainism in the following
manner:

There was a reaction to vedic ritualism.
2. The focus shifted towards ethics and morality, though
there were changes in vedic philosophy also. There
were social and economic changes.

3. There were philosophical differences, they developed

their unique doctrines and practices.

4. Buddhism and Jainism appealed to broader popula-
tion, there was royal patronage such as by emperors
such as Ashoka.

5. Buddhism and Jainism tried to connect with people
in common languages. Early Buddhist scriptures,
known as the ‘Three Baskets’ (Tripitaka - faften) or
Pali Canon, were written in Pali (afc). That was the
common language in Bihar and UP where Buddhism
originated. Similarly, the early Jain scriptures, includ-
ing the Agamas (21774), were written in Ardhamagadhi
Prakrit (aeinmeit weed). Jainism later used Sanskrit for
accessing Indian philosophy.

There are 24 Tirthankaras (atime) in Jainism, the spir-
itual leaders who attained enlightenment, are highly
revered. Rishabhanatha GessM1%), the first Tirthankara,
and Mahavira (Heat), the 24th and final Tirthankara, are
particularily esteemed.

Jain teachings focus on ethical living Cif sila),
spiritual growth (sTeafere faenra), and the welfare of all
beings. This philosophy underlines principles like non-
violence (stfa), truthfulness (44m), and non-attach-
ment (€tFa), guiding followers towards a path of moral
and spiritual purity.

Basadis (Saal) are Jain tempies or monasteries where
devotees and monks perform worship and rituais.
‘Saptabhangi (aefivenyei)’ or “Sapta Puri(aa Ti)’ are the
highiy sacred places for Jains such as Ayodhya, Uijain,
Mathura, Dwarka, Kashi, Kanchipuram.

Jainism mentioned the following:

© Dharma (214) is the Jain concept of righteousness
and the path to liberation.

° Nirjara (FSRD is the process of purification of the
soul.

° Bandha (a) is the attachment of the soul to karma.

° Moksa (ata) is liberation from the cycle of birth and
death.

© Adharma (3teR4) is the opposite of dharma and leads
to bondage.

° Akasha (also spelled as akasa - ST&T9) is the first
of the nine primary substances (tattva 7) and is con-
sidered to be the fundamental constituent of space.

Texts such as Samavaya Sutra (AA at Aas Ya) and
Pragnapara Sutra (4a YA) mention various scripts,
with the former discussing 64 types and the latter about
a dozen. Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsang (aun win - during
King Harshvardhana in 7th century) noted that children’s
education started with learning alphabets, followed by
subjects like grammar, arts and crafts, medicine, logic,
and philosophy. The following concepts are important.



=== Page 132 ===
10.6

1. Anekantavada (3Mentaate): Termed as ‘non-abso-
lutism’, this principle holds that objects have infinite
modes of existence, and only Kevalins (enlightened
beings) can fully comprehend all knowledge aspects.
Syadavada (@leate ): A theory of conditioned predi-
cation, suggesting that our perceptions and judgments
are conditional and depend on specific situations.

3. Nayavada (~aale): This emphasizes partial view-
points, describing reality from various perspectives.
Sevenfold Predication, known as Saptabhangi (aa)
in Jainism, is a concept associated with Nayavada. It
outlines a unique approach to expressing statements,
emphasizing their conditional and relative nature.
Saptabhangi illustrates that any statement can be
seen from seven different perspectives, each reflect-
ing a different aspect of truth.

In Jainism, the approach to learning and imparting
knowledge encompasses various methods, each serving
a specific purpose in the educational process. Here’s how
each term fits into this system:

1. Vachana (ater): Reading scriptures or texts is
essential in Jain education, focusing on the Agamas
and other religious writings.

2. Prachchana (West): This method values asking
questions and dialogue, encouraging students to clar-
ify doubts and deepen their understanding.

3. Anupreksa (3T{WaIT): It involves reflecting on what
has been learned, with critical thinking and self-
reflection being key in Jain philosophy.

4. Amhaya (3141): This systematic approach breaks

complex subjects into smaller parts for thorough and

in-depth understanding.

Dharmapalesa (eatery): It entails spreading reli-

gious teachings widely, with Jain monks and scholars

preaching principles like non-violence and ethical liv-

ing.

Main Scripture: ‘Agamas’ (31rT4) refers to the sacred texts
of Jainism, which contain the teachings and philosophies
central to Jainism.

TRANSMISSION [ViopEs In Ancient Epucation

These methods remained integral to the educational
processes in ancient education. They reflect a holistic
approach which combined rote learning with critical
thinking, practical application, and interactive learning.

1. Oral Transmission of Knowledge: This method was
crucial due to the limited availability of written texts.
In Hinduism, the Vedas and other scriptures were tra-
ditionally passed down orally. Jainism also relied heav-
ily on oral transmission of its scriptures and teachings.

2. Memorization: Memorizing texts and teachings
was a foundational method, essential for preserving
-knowledge across generations.

bog

Critical Analysis and Introspection: The learn?

ers acknowledge the importance of teachings (map.

tras) in their lives. They try to deeply internalize thi,
knowledge, by applying them in their daily actions
and decisions.

. Storytelling: Lord Buddha used this method specifi.
cally used to explain His doctrines. That made com.
plex ideas more accessible and relatable. This ke
method was also used in Hinduism and Jainism fo;
conveying moral and ethical lessons. ~

5. Question and Answer Method: This interactive
approach encouraged students to delve deeper into
subjects, clarifying doubts and expanding their
understanding.

6. Hands-on Method: For practical subjects like medi-
cal science, hands-on learning was employed to give
students real-world experience and skills.

7. Seminars, Debates, and Discussions: Seminars

were used for debates and discussions, promoting

critical thinking and the exchange of ideas, they facil-
itated intellectual development and mastery of the
subjects.

Education and Translation Efforts: A significant project
involved translating Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit
into Tibetan, forming the Tibetan Buddhist philosophy
(Kangyur and Tengyur). This project included many nota-

ble Indian and Tibetan scholars.

Indian Scholars: Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche)
Ceniva CTS )): He worked hard to translate
texts, helping to establish Buddhism in Tibet. Similar
efforts were made by Atisha (3ifagi — 982 — 1054 CE) and
Shantarakshita (sazféta), both Indian scholars.

Tibetan Translators

° Thonmi Sambhota (arrit diet): He is credited —
with creating the Tibetan script from Indic scripts, he
enabled the translation of Sanskrit texts into Tibetan.

* Vairotsana (Qtr): made similar efforts by working
diligently to translate numerous texts into Tibetan.

° Marpa Lotsawa (Ataf eieatar) is known as ‘Marpa
the Translator’. After studying under Indian masters,
he returned to Tibet with many texts.

1. Non-Vedic Philosophy Schools: Buddhism, along
with Jainism and Charvakas, is part of the Nastika
schools (aI), which reject the authority of the
Upanishads.

2. Emphasis on Renunciation: Buddhism focused on
subjects that led away from worldly life enrichment,
prioritizing the renunciatory aspect of education.

3. Jiva (sia), also known as Jivatman, refers to the
living, sentient soul or essence of a being and Ajiva
(asf@), on the other hand, refers to the non-living,
inanimate aspects of existence.

_ Mass Education by Lord Buddha: Started 2600 years
ago, Buddhist education was inclusive, beyond caste
divisions. The Dhamma Vinaya (44 fava) included
ethical codes and’ moral advice. Lord Buddha’s
. first sermon in Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh, is known as
Dharma-Chakra-Pravartana (u4-aa-wad").
. Middle Path and Individual Responsibility: Buddha
advocated the ‘Middle Path’ (474 arth, emphasizing
personal happiness and responsibility. Begging by dis-
ciples aimed to eliminate ego.
Democratic Expansion and Monasteries:

sion, with many monasteries evolving into universi-
ties. Bhikkhus (fg) and Bhikkhunis or Upasikas
(fargo a saftent) were the main students.
, Sangha for Management: Monks were organized
into Sanghas (Ht) for better management. The com-
munity of monks, nuns, novices, and lay followers is
called as Sangha (#1).
, Contribution to Art and Architecture: Notable con-
tributions include stupas (&{4) at Sanchi, Bharhut,
and Gaya.
. Life-Long Monastic Commitment: Unlike the Vedic
system, Buddhist students often remained monks,
severing worldly ties permanently. ~
. Oral Tradition and Written Teachings: Buddha’s
teachings, originally oral, were written in Pali around
25 BCE. .
Key Texts: Important texts include Divyavadana
), Dipavamsa (etv4e), Mahavamsa (Hetae),

if the the development of wisdom, ethical conduct, and
mental discipline.
ae Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path
. Core teachings include the Four Noble Truths (21fa-
9 the Weal) and the Eightfold Path (a1sift Ari).
Ajiva Four Noble Truths in Buddhism:
VING> 1. Dukkha (Gq): Suffering, acknowledging that exis-

tence is characterized by discomfort and dissatisfaction.

'_ ing, asserting that it’s possible to liberate oneself from
suffering.

4. Magga (art-e wate): The path leading

Popular Meditation Practices: Vipassana and Samatha

1. Vipassana (faaget) - Insight meditation through
three elements:

(i) Impermanence (feet - Anicca): Recognizing
that everything in existence is transient and con-
stantly changing.

(ii) Suffering ({@a - Dukkha): Understanding that
suffering is an inherent part of existence.

(iii) Non-self (3T aT - Anatta): Realizing the absence
of a permanent, unchanging self or soul in beings
and phenomena.

ing on a single object, like the breath, a mantra, or a
visual object.

Eightfold Path: Right view, Right intention, Right
speech, Right action, Right livelihood, Right mindfulness,
Right effort, Right concentration.

Five Precepts (Gagite-Panchsheel): Lord Buddha
suggested abstain from the following: Violence (fé€t),
Stealing (Nt), Sexual Misconduct (HH* ar), Lying

Caaitet derett sat aA).

Buddhist Councils (at Wet): In total, four major
Buddhist councils were conducted.

1. The First Council (ager ete ): This was held in 483
BCE in the Sattapani cave at Rajgriha. The teachings
of Buddha were divided into three Pitakas (fT2m):

(a) Vinaya Pitaka (fata fae@): Rules of conduct
and discipline applicable to the monastic life of
the monks and nuns.

(b) Sutta Pitaka (Qa fea ): The main teaching or
Dhamma of Buddha (it is divided into five Nikayas

in Vaishali.

3. The Third Council (qta Wea ): This was conducted in
Pataliputra under the patronage of Ashoka.

4, The Fourth Council (aqet zat): This was conducted
at Kundalvana, Kashmir. :

Two Sects of Buddhism

1. Mahayana (Agar -- Great Vehicle): it believes in
the higher order and idol worship of Buddha. It soon
spread in northern India and then to China, Korea,
Tibet, and Japan. Zen is also a school of Mahayana.



=== Page 134 ===
2. Hinayana (ara — Lesser Vehicle): Also known as
Abandoned Vehicle or Defective Vehicle. It believes in
the original teaching of Buddha or doctrine of elders.
Theravada is a Hinayana sect.

In fact, Buddhism is a way of ‘soft diplomacy that was
more liberal than ‘vedic’ approach. It promoted the spread
of Indian culture to other parts of Asia.

Effective revitalization of the Nalanda University proj-
ect and encouragement of Buddhist studies in well-estab-
lished universities will bring the international community
to acommon platform.

Tvees OF TEACHERS

1. Acharya (31Tad): Revered teachers of the Vedas
(aa), offering knowledge selflessly without charging
fees.

2. Upadhyaya (sareara): Teachers who focused on a

cism also and would receive royal patronage.

3. Goshthi (71 ): These were national conferences con-
vened by kings for representatives of various schools
to debate and discuss ideas.

4, Ashramas (311814): These were hermitages around

canon Kangyur’ (@PqX) and ‘Tengyur’ (dx). The former
refers to translated words of Lord Buddha and later to the _
various scholars and practitioners.

Taxita University (aartoren fastener )

The university offered a wide variety of subjects that was
aimost 68 in number. The distinguished scholars were
the following:

Be

G) Panini (arfinfy): The ancient Sanskrit grammarian
known for his work ‘Ashtadhyay?’ (3184), the foun-

dational text on Sanskrit grammar.

(ii) Charak (@R& ): The legendary figure in Indian medi-
cine, author of the ‘Charaka Samhita’, a foundational
text in Ayurveda.

(iii)Other scholars traditionally associated with Taxila
include Kautilya {also famous as Chanakya or
Vishnugupta) and Vishnu Sharma, though histori-
cal evidence of their direct connection to Taxila is
not definitive. Vishnu Sharma wrote ‘Panchatantra’
(Wada) ;

Thus, due to above associations, Taxila university was

famous for medicines, political sciences, languages

(Sanskrit), Vedic and Buddhism studies, military to name

a few.

e The University attracted students from Babylon,
Greece, Syria, and China. There was influence of
Greek culture after the invasion of Alexander that was

ing its role in both religious and secular education.

° In fact, the university was not properly centralized, so
the teachers at separate places played their separate
roles on the basis of their reputation.

e The university (along with Nalanda and other uni-
versities) was famous for Jataka Tales which are 4

collection of stories about the previous births of Lord
Buddha, in which he appeared in various forms,
both human and animal. These tales illustrate moral
lessons and the concept of Karma, reflecting the
Buddhist principles of ethical conduct and wisdom.
That was a kind of story telling and oral tradition.

ALANDA University (*eter fasfererrera )

alanda University, akin to modern institutions like
xford and Harvard for its universal approach and exten-
ve curriculum, was a prestigious centre of learning in
cient India.

The university is situated near Rajgriha (Ute) in
Bihar, Nalanda was a pivotal center for Mahayana
Buddhism (Hear ate 4) and the birthplace of Sar-
iputta Caitga), a prominent disciple of Lord Buddha.
Ic functioned from approximately 427 to 1197 cE.
The campus of university extended over approxi-
mately 1.6 kms by 0.8 kms that comprised eight large
halis (Gah) and 300 studyrooms. —
Administration and Faculty: Sheelbhadra (3it4a),
serving as the kulpati (@eafa) or chancellor, over-
saw a faculty that included teachers like Dwar Pandit
(gR-Ufed). Chinese traveller Hiuen ‘Tsang noted the

(%@ APR), ‘Ratnodavi’ (<aleat), and ‘Ratnayanjak’
(aaah). The university also housed an observa-
tory, Ambudharaaviehi (37aertacifé), for astronomi-
cal research.

Cultural Impact and Legacy: Nalanda significantly
contributed to the cultural and intellectual advance-
ment of India, during Gupta era.

° Destruction and Revival: The university was ulti-
mately destroyed towards the end of the 12th century
CE, primarily due to the invasions led by Bakhtiyar
Khilji. In 2010, a new Nalanda University was estab-
lished in Bihar with international support, reviving
its legacy. The help was provided by Japan, China,
Thailand, Laos, Singapore and Australia in various
manners.

VatasHi University (aenit fanfare )

This university was a significant center of learning,
was prominent in advancing Hinayana Buddhism and
various secular studies from 600 cz to 1400 cE.

Thus, this university again played a role in Buddhist
and secular education. Arthashastra (31 -econom-
ics), Niti Shastra (Alfaset - law), and Chikitsa Shastra
¢ - medicine) were the prominent courses
here. It was highly regarded by Chinese travelers Hiuen
Tsang and Itsing for its comprehensive curriculum.
This university played an important role in
Brahminical sciences, showcasing its inclusive and
diverse academic environment.

The prominent scholars included Gunamati ([THfa)
and Sthirmati (fafa) who contributed significantly
to its scholarly reputation.

The university enjoyed a prosperous phase until 755
cE but faced partial destruction due to Arab inva-
sions. However, it continued to function until the 12th
century.

This university helped in the development and spread
of Vajrayana Buddhism.

Their architecture might have influenced the design
of other Buddhist universities such as Nalanda.

The decline of Odantapuri, resulting from Muslim
invasions, that was a setback to Buddhist education in
India.

jaGADDALA University (Street fasferenera )

Jagaddala University was established by Raja Ram Pal
of the Pala dynasty, patrons of Buddhism and educa-
tion. This was famous translating Buddhist texts into
Tibetan.

This university also served as a center for Buddhist
education, especially Mahayana Buddhism, under-
lining the Palas’ commitment to Buddhism. The uni-
versity operated for about 100 years for Buddhist
scholarship.

Jagaddala was destroyed during an invasion in 1203
CE.

Mituica University (fafarert fasfererrera )

Mithila, also known as Videha (faeé), emerged as a
prominent center for Brahmanical education during
the Upanishadic era. This maintained its influence
from Raja Janak through the Buddhist period to devo-
tees of Lord Krishna.

Mithila was the birthplace of famous poets like
Vidyapati, who wrote in Hindi, and Jaideo, a noted
Sanskrit poet.
There were diverse courses such as literature, fine
arts, and scientific subjects. The university was
known for its teachings in Nyaya Shastra (4 86a)
and Tarka Shastra, with Gangesha Upadhyaya estab-
lishing a school of New Logic (7 =).

A landmark work, Tattva Chintamani (aafearaftn),
was written here, contributing significantly to Indian
philosophy.

Mithila maintained its prominence up to the time of
Emperor Akbar.

Napia University (atfear fasfeerera )

° Nadia University, situated at the confluence of the

Ganga and Jalangi rivers in Bengal, was originally

known as Navadweep (4a4l%). The university’s

education was centered around three locations:

: Navadweep, Shantipur, and Gopalpura.

rersity ° The university was known for its connection with the

, The ‘Gita Govind’ (tia Tifa) by Jaideva (sea), a clas-
sical Sanskrit literary work. Raghunatha Shiromani

(aaa fererafer), was famous for studies on logic.

° There were set teaching standards.

SANGHAPEETHA (@adts)

This great institution was established in Kashmir in the
2nd century BCE, that era is termed as the golden age
of Sanskrit learning in Kashmir. Fhe renowned scholars
such as Abhinavagupta (SfMaqe) and Kalhana (eT)
contributed significantly. The philosophy, poetry, and his-
tory were main fields.

SHARDAPEETH (STITaTUTS)

Established in the 6th century CE, Sharada Peeth thrived
for centuries as a renowned temple-university dedicated
to the goddess Saraswati, the Hindu deity of knowledge
and learning.

Sartore: (GATT)

With numerous hostels, it catered to a diverse student
body, emphasizing the importance of inclusive education
in ancient India.

Ennavirnam (warferea )

This provided free boarding and tuition, it exemplified the
ancient Indian emphasis on making education accessible.

Note: The universities at Takshashila, Nalanda, Valabhi,
Vikramshila, Odantapuri and Jagaddala developed in
connection with the viharas (mainly Buddhism). The uni-
versities at Benaras, Navadeep and Kanchi developed in
connection with temples and became centres of commu-
nity life in the places where they were situated.

OtHeR SCHOLARS IN ANCIENT INDIA

1. Sushruta (Gf): Known as the ‘Father of Surgery,’
he authored the ‘Sushruta Samhita’ (G4q Wed), a
seminal text if ancient Indian medicine, particularly
surgery. The specific university or educational cen-

Hridayam Samhita’ (si ean fed), another
important work in Ayurveda.

3. Varahamihira (azretafat): Born in Ujjain, he was an
astronomer and mathematician. His work, ‘Pancha-
siddhantika’ (ta-fergifaal), suggests that he was part
of the scholarly tradition of Ujjain, which was known
for its astronomical and mathematical studies.

4, Bhaskaracharya ( ): A12th-century math-
ematician known for his work in the decimal number
system and an early understanding of gravitational
theory. He might have been associated with Ujjain.

Languages Used

1. Sanskrit during Vedic education
2. Prakrit during Jain education
3. Pali during Buddhist education

There were no caste restrictions during Buddhist and Jain
periods. That also impacted choice of language.
Sanskrit was used all the times.

Role of Rulers and Emperors in Expansion of Buddhism

1. Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (304-232 sce): His
extensive patronage of Buddhism led to the establish-
ment and development of monastic and educational
centres across his empire.

2. Gupta Dynasty Rulers (320-550 cE): Their era is
usually referred as ‘Golden Era’. Gupta periodis often
associated with the flourishing of Nalanda University.

3. Pala Dynasty Rulers (750-1174 cE): The Palas
were instrumental in the establishment of prominent
Buddhist centres that later evolved into major educa-
tional institutions:
e¢ Vikramashila

Dharmapala.
e Somapura Mahavihara: Another significant cen-
tre of learning established during the Pala dynasty.

4. Kanishka the Great (78-101 cE) of the Kushan
Empire: His reign, however, significantly contributed
to the spread of Buddhism, which led to the growth of
educational centres across his empire.

5. Harsha Vardhana (590-647 cE): His patronage of
both Buddhism and Hinduism supported the growth
of learning centres in northern India during his time.

University: Founded by

Duringthe continuous Islamic invasions, many education cen-
tres in northern India were destroyed. This actually resulted
to a shift of the Vedic system of education to the South.

1. Vedic Education in the South: Under the patronage of
the Vijayanagara rulers, Vedic scholars like Sayana and
Madhava wrote extensive commentaries on the Vedas.

2.

This period shows a diversification of educational sys
tems, with traditional Vedic education coexisting with
Islamic and later Mughal influences, each contributing
uniquely to the educational landscape of India.

Islamic Education: The Muslim ruling elite focuseq
on urban education, establishing libraries and litera,
societies. They founded primary schools called mak,
tabs (Hwa) for basic education in reading, writjp
and Islamic prayers, and secondary schools calleg
madrasas for advanced language and religious styq
ies. Often attached to mosques, these Islamic schoo]
were primarily for boys, with girls from affluent fay;
lies receiving education at home.
Mughal Era Education: Persian was the court lan,
guage during the Mughal era. Elite boys attendeq
Persian schools to learn literature, history, ethics
law, administration, and court protocol. Sufi retreats _
(khangah - GITe) were centres for spreading mystic
doctrines and ideas. :
Sanskrit and Other Forms of Education: Sanskrit |
academies continued teaching young Brahman males.
in literature and law. Apprenticeship and commercial.
schools trained boys in business skills.
Education for Girls: Education for girls was rare and |
mostly limited to domestic spheres or home-based |
learning, especially in affluent families.

The process by which governments or societies translate
their educational vision and goals into concrete programs
and activities. This involves creating and delivering out-
comes that manifest as desired changes in the real world.

Thus, formulation and implementation of policies are
important to us. The British system moved through a com-
bination of reports, policies and implementation, the pres-
ent Indian Government is also moving in the same manner.

Ficure 10.2 Factors Relating to Policy Formation in Education Sector

Decision-Making and Guidance: Education policy can
be an explicit or implicit decision or set of decisions. These
decisions provide directives for future actions, initiate or
retard certain activities, and guide the implementation of
prior decisions.

Policy, therefore, represents a strategic course of action
rather than day-to- day decisions or actions. It is perceived
by analysts as a long-term, strategic approach to man-
aging and improving education. The given aspects are
important.

1. Problem Identification: Recognizing and defining
the educational issues or challenges that need to be
addressed.

2. Policy Formation: Developing policies to address the
identified problems.

3. Decision-Making: Making choices and decisions tar-
geting the identified problems.

4, Implementation: Executing the plan or applying the
policy in a practical setting.

5. Analysis and Evaluation: Continuously assessing
the policy to determine its effectiveness and deciding
whether to continue, modify, or terminate it.

Pre-INDEPENDENCE SCENARIO IN EDUCATION IN
INDIA

The basic motivations for setting up modern education
system in India were the following:

° British Influence: Modern education in India started
under British rule, primarily to create a class of edu-
cated Indians who could assist in administrative tasks.

* Role of Christian Missionaries: They played a key
. role in spreading modern education, often focusing
on English language and Western sciences.

¢ Contribution of Indian Intellectuals and
Reformers: Indian leaders and reformers advocated
for education reform, blending traditional Indian
knowledge with modern subjects.

Epucarion Durine Bartisn Era

1. Calcutta Madrassa (1781): This was established by.

Warren Hastings in 1781 for teaching Muslim law:
That actually marked a significant step in formal edu-
cation under British rule. Asiatic Society of Bengal
was set up in 1784.
2. Sanskrit College in Banaras (Varanasi)(1791):

Founded by Jonathan Duncan in 1791, this college

focused on the study of Hindu philosophy and law,
indicating an interest in traditional Indian learning
systems.

Fort William College was set up in 1800.
Charter Act of 1813: This act marked the first gov-
ernment initiative towards education in India, leading
to debates about whether education should adhere to
traditional methods or embrace modernity.

w

4. Hindu College of Calcutta (1817): Raja Ram Mohan
Roy played an important role in the establishment ’

of this prestigious college. This institution was later
renamed as Presidency College in 1855 when it was
taken over by the British government and made into
a government institution. This college was upgraded
into Presidency University in 2010.

5. Senate of Serampore College (University) (1818):
This institution was indeed founded in 1818 and was
granted the status of a university in 1829, making it
the oldest university in India that is still in operation.
It was established primarily for theological education
and later expanded to other fields.

6. Mountstuart Elphinstone’s Minutes (1823):
Elphinstone’s proposal in 1823 emphasized the need



=== Page 141 ===
+ for schools to teach English and European sciences,
laying the groundwork for modern education in India.
. sanskrit College, Calcutta (1824): This college was
set up under the patronage of Lord Amherst. Ishwar
Chander Vidyasagar joined this college in 1841. He
advocated to include English and Bengali as mediums
of instruction alongside Sanskrit. He campaigned
against Sati Pratice that officially ended in 1856.
Earlier Raja Ram Mohan Roy also campaigned against
Sati Practice. Lord William Bentick officially ended
that Sati practice in Bengal in 1829.

. Lord Macaulay’s Minutes (1835): Lord Macaulay
advocated for educating Indians in English language
and literature in 1835, aiming to create a class of
English-educated Indians.

. Introduction of English as Medium of Instruction
(1835): Under Lord William Bentinck, the decision
to introduce English as the medium of instruction
marked the beginning of a significant shift in Indian
education, particularly targeting the upper and mid-
dle classes with the ‘Infiltration Theory’.

Infiltration Theory: This was basically a ‘trickle
down’. Western education and values would gradu-
ally spread from an initially loyal elite class to the
wider population, serving both administrative con-
venience and cultural influence. The British wanted
that their ‘White Man’s Burden’ (a phrase coined by
Rudyard Kipling) to dominate the Indian masses, so
that their rule is long term. We may add social -cul-
ture dominance to this.

Charles Trevelyan, a British official, believed Indian
education should include both local and Western
elements. To him education should be inclusive, so
local culture and literature were important. He pre-
sented these ideas in his his 1838 publication, ‘On the
Education of the People of India.’

.Founding of Elphinstone College and Calcutta
Medical College (1835): Elphinstone College was
named after Mountstuart Elphinstone, the then
Governor of Bombay. Calcutta Medical College was
the first institution in Asia for the study of western
medicine. Both represent the expansion of English
education in India, in liberal arts and medical sciences.
. Sir Charles Wood’s Dispatch (1854): Termed the
‘Magna Carta of English Education in India,’ this dis-
patch advocated a comprehensive education system
from primary schools to universities, emphasizing

ras later indigenous education and a unified education policy.

13. Aligarh Muslim University (1875): Sir Syed Ahmed
Khan founded the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental Col-
lege to promote modern education for Muslims. This
college was later upgraded into a Aligarh Muslim Uni-
versity.

14. Vernacular Press Act (1878): This act aimed to
control the content published in newspapers and
magazines printed in languages other than English.
it proved to be highly controversial, sparking wide-
spread protests and criticism. This opposition ulti-
mately led to the Act's repeal in 1882.

15. Establishment of Punjab University (1882): This
university was established in 1882 in Lahore (now in
Pakistan) to cater to the education needs of people of
Punjab, and also to reduce the workload and admin-
istrative burden of University of Calcutta, which was
established in 1857. Punjab University in Chandigarh
was established in 1958-1960. Punjab University is
not a central university. It's a state university, jointly
funded by the governments of Punjab and Haryana in
an inter-state body corporate, with Punjab contribut-
ing higher funds. The location of this university in the
UT, that is also joint capital of Punjab and Haryana
raises some questions about the status.

16. Indian Education Commission/Hunter Commission °

(1882-83): This commission recommended the seg-
regation of primary and higher education, leading to
specific focus areas in the education system.

17. Allahabad University (1887): The location of this
university was renamed as Prayagraj. This is often
referred to as the "Oxford of the East" during the
British era. Allahabad University was significantly
influenced by Sir William Muir, who was the Lt.
Governor of United Provinces at the time. Initially, he
laid the foundation for Muir Central College (named
after him) in 1873, which subsequently became an
integral part of the prestigious Allahabad University.

18. Promotion of Technical and Vocational Education:
Efforts were made to advance technical and voca-
tional education, meeting the administrative and
industrial needs of British India.

19. Rise of Women’s Education: Initiatives for for-
mal education for women began, with figures like
Savitribai Phule playing a crucial role.

20. Raleigh Commission and Indian Universities Act:

¢ The Raleigh Commission: The Indian Universities
Commission, headed by Sir Thomas Raleigh, was
indeed appointed in 1902 to investigate and recom-
mend reforms for higher education in India.

° Curzon Universities Act of 1902: Lord Curzon's Act
did lay the groundwork for reform by introducing
measures like centralized control, affiliation of col-
leges, and standardized examinations.

° Indian Universities Act of 1904: This Act built upon
the 1902 Act by providing more detailed legislative
implementation of the Raleigh Commission's recom-
mendations. It further strengthened government con-
trol, mandated teaching, and promoted research in

universities. There was some critical reaction on this
act by nationalist leaders.

National Council of Education (1905): Established
by Swadeshi nationalist leaders, this council aimed to
promote indigenous education systems and values.
This initiative led to the establishment of institutions
like Jadavpur University.

Indian Institute of Science (1909): Though founded
in the British era, IISc in Bangalore became a leading
institution for scientific research and higher educa-
tion in India after independence.

Rabindranath Tagore’s Educational Initiatives:
Tagore set up the Shanti Niketan institutions, and
later, in 1921, Vishwa Bharati University. These insti-
tutions were aimed at providing holistic education
and promoting Indian culture and values. Vishwa
Bharati University is now recognized as an ‘Institution
of National Importance,’ uniquely having the Prime
Minister of India as its Chancellor.

Education Policy Resolution (1913): This resolu-
tion marked another step in the evolution of educa-
tion policy in India. ‘

Banaras Hindu University (1916): BHU was estab-
lished by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya with the
aim of blending modern education with Hindu values
and traditions. It emerged during the Indian indepen-
dence movement as a symbol of self-reliance in edu-
cation and cultural preservation.

Calcutta University Commission/Sadler Commission
(1917): The Sadler Commission recommended the sep-
aration of intermediate education from degree colleges
and advocated for greater autonomy for universities’
teaching bodies. These reforms aimed to improve the
quality and governance of higher education. -
Morley-Minto Reforms (1919): Part of these
reforms included the transfer of authority over edu-
cation to provincial levels and Indian ministers, under
the ‘diarchy’ system. This allowed for more local and
Indian involvement in the management of education.
Jamia Millia Islamis (1920): This institution was
founded as an expression of nationalist aspirations
within the Muslim community. It sought to provide
a platform for modern education while preserving
Islamic culture and identity.

Precursor to the 10+2+3 System: The reforms and
recommendations during this period set the stage for
the eventual adoption of the 10+2+3 system of edu-
cation, comprising 10 years of schooling followed by
two years of higher secondary education and three
years of university education.

Establishment of CABE : The Central Advisory Board
of Education (CABE) was first established in 1920. It is
the oldest and most significant advisory body on educa-
tion in the Government of India. Despite being dissolved
in 1923, it was revived in 1935 and has since been an
influential body in shaping educational policies.
Inter-University Board (1925): Known later as the
Association of Indian Universities, this board was set

‘up to promote cooperation and information sharing

In a nutshell, the education system established under
British rule laid the groundwork for modern education in
India. It introduced a structured approach to education,
including the establishment of universities and an empha-
sis on English language and Western sciences.

lish India’s first national education system post World

among universities in the fields of education, culture”
sports, and other areas. It was mainly representeg by
vice-chancellors of universities.
Indian School of Mines. (1926): Establisheg in
Dhanbad (now in Jharkhand) to cater to the mining -
and related industries.

Hartog Commission (1929): This commission
focused on enhancing the quality and standards of
education in India, addressing concerns over educa.
tional expansion.
Sapru Committee (1934): This committee was
focused on addressing the issue of unemployment,
reflecting the growing need to align education wit
employment opportunities. :

of British educational policies.

Wardha Scheme of Education (1937): Also known
as ‘Nai Talim’ or basic education, this scheme was
based on the recommendations of Mahatma Gandhi.
It emphasized practical and work-based education,
with a focus on developing character and social ser-
vice, alongside intellectual skills. ‘
Sargent Report (1944): The official name was
officially known as the ‘Central Advisory Board of
Education on Post-War Educational Development in
India’. This aimed at comprehensive reforms to estab-

ing

War II.
Establishment of UGC: The report recommended
the creation of the University Grants Commission
(UGC) for higher education oversight, modeled after.
the UK’s UGC with a full-time Chairman and educa-
tionist members.

University Grants Committee (1945): This was a
precursor to the UGC. It initially managed key central
universities (Aligarh Muslim University, Banaras Hindu
University, University of Delhi), later extending its over-
sight to all Indian universities. This focused on expand-
ing and improving educational facilities, linking pre
and post-independence educational reforms in India.

After gaining independence in 1947, the Government of
India shifted its focus to meet the expectations and needs
of its people. The colonial education system served as a
basis, but there was a concerted effort to make educa-
tion more inclusive, accessible, and aligned with national
goals and values. IIT, Kharagpur (West Bengal) was
planned during British era, was set up in 1951.

1. Expansion of Educational Infrastructure: That
happened in terms of expansion of schools, colleges
and universities. .

Emphasis on Scientific Research: These led to the

setting up of specialized institutions like IITs (Indian

Institutes of Technology) and IISc (Indian Institute of

Science).

Development of Indigenous Curriculum: To reso-

nate with India’s cultural and intellectual heritage,

while also incorporating modern, global perspectives.

Increased Government Support: The initiatives

such as establishment of UGC (University Grants

Commission) and CSIR (Council of Scientific and

Industrial Research).

Growth of Technical and Management Education:

This happened with the establishment of various IITs,

NITs (National Institutes of Technology), and IIMs

(Indian Institutes of Management).

Focus on Liberal Arts and Social Sciences: To

deal with diversity, there was a focus on liberal arts,

humanities, and social sciences, reflecting a holistic
approach to higher education.

Private Sector Participation: Post-liberalization,

the private sector started playing a significant role in

‘higher education, leading to the establishment of pri-

vate universities and colleges.

Global Collaboration and Research: There was

increased collaboration with foreign universities for

research, faculty exchange, and student exchange
programs.

Digital Education and Online Learning: Recent

years have seen a surge in digital education and

online learning platforms, broadening access to
higher education.

10. Research and Innovation: There has been a growing
focus on research and innovation, with initiatives to
boost original research and development in various
fields.

University Education Commission: This was led by Dr.
S. Radhakrishnan in 1948. They looked into the state of
university education in India after independence.

1. Education as a Shared Responsibility of Centre and
State: This idea was proposed when India’s Constitu-
tion was being written. But the Constituent Assembly,
which was making the Constitution, preferred that
such issues should be managed by states. Eventually,
acompromise was made. While education was mainly



=== Page 144 ===
10.18

a state matter, the Constitution gave some powers to
the central government too.

2. India adopted the following changes to a more orga-
nized approach, keeping in view the Commission’s
work and suggestions:

¢ Entry 63: The central government controls big
institutions like the National Library in Kolkata
and major universities like BHU, AMU, and Delhi
University.

e Entry 64: This is about the central government’s
role in managing big scientific and technical edu-
cation institutions like IITs.

¢ Entry 65: The central government can set up and
manage institutions for professional, vocational,
or technical training, including science and tech
institutions.

* Entry 66: The most important one for education
quality. It’s about the central government’s job to
coordinate and set standards for higher education
and research institutions, ensuring they all meet
high-quality benchmarks.

e Under Entry 66, key regulatory bodies like the
UGC, AICTE, National Medical Commission
(formerly Medical Council of India as of 2019),
Nursing Council, CAR, Pharmacy Council of India,
Institute of Architects, Institute of Accountancy,
and the Bar Council of India were established.

UGC and Grants-in-Aid (1952): In 1952, the Indian gov-
ernment decided that the University Grants Commission
(UGC) would handle all matters related to grants-in-
aid for central universities and other higher education
institutions. The UGC was officially launched by Shri
Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, then Minister of Education,
on December 28, 1953.

Formal Establishment of UGC (1956): The UGC was
formally established as a statutory body in November
1956 through an Act of Parliament. Its main role is to
coordinate, determine, and maintain standards of univer-
sity education in India.

Mupauar Commission (1952-1953)

¢ Also known as the Secondary Education Commission.

* Recommended a three-year secondary and a four
year higher education system.

* Advocated for the establishment of multipurpose
schools and vocational training institutes.

CommMitTeeE ON Emotional IntecraTion (1961)

® Chaired by Dr. Sampurnanand
° Aimed to study the role of educational programs in
promoting emotional integration among youth.

Gusarati As Mepium oF Instruction (1963)

e Gujarat University decided to make Gujarati the sole
medium of instruction and examination, which was
later reversed following a court decision.

Kothari Commission Recommendations: The officia]
name of commission was ‘Indian Education Commissioy
(1964-1966). This was chaired by Dr. Daulat Singh
Kothari. This proved to be a major milestone in the deve].
opment of education policy in India. This Commission
focused on increase in educational productivity to contrib.
ute to economic growth, social and national Integration
educational modernization and developing Social, Moral.
and Spiritual Values. :

Main Suggestions of Kothari Commission: They were
as follows:

1. Free and Compulsory Education (Article 45),
Advocated for free and compulsory education for chil-
dren aged between 6 to 14 years.

2. Establishment of Indian Education Service (IES); |
This proposed the creation of IES for effective educa-
tion management.

3. Investment in Education: This commission recom-
mended allocating 6% of the national income to edu-
cation. The current expenditure is 4.6%.

4. 10+2+3 System of Education: This later became
the standard structure for school and higher educa-
tion in India. The common school system ensured
equal opportunity for all children regardless of their
background. There was focus on science and technol-
ogy and social service.

5. Language Policy: The commission promoted
‘National Integration’ by unifying linguistic diversity _
in the following manner:

e Regional Languages: Recognizing the impor-
tance of mother tongue, the formula prioritized
regional languages in education.

° English as a Bridge: Inclusion of English aimed -
to provide access to global knowledge and
opportunities.

° No doubt, the formula faced criticism for poten-
tially marginalizing some languages and impos-
ing Hindi dominance.

6. Teacher Training and Status: The recommendations
influenced the establishment and enhancement of
District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs)
and State Councils of Educational Research and
Training (SCERTs) in later years.

7. Creation of ‘Cluster of Centres’: This proposed |
establishing clusters of centres for high-quality
research and training.

The commission also focused on vocational education,
autonomy for Institutions and continuous evaluation.

Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi (1969): JNU
was set up in the spirit of cultural and social ferment of
post-independence India. The spirit was ambitious, inno-

A decentralized model with autonomous schools and
emphasis on student participation, international outlook,
and ultimately a university with a difference. But the evo-
lutionary approach led to some issues.

HiGHer EDUCATION

Higher education is no doubt more important to us as per
NTA UGC NET JRF Exam.

1. Flexible Curriculum and Multiple Exit Options:
Undergraduate education will have a flexible cur-
riculum with options for 3 or 4 years. Students can
receive certificates at various stages, such as a Cer-
tificate after 1 year, Advanced Diploma after 2 years,
Bachelor’s Degree after 3 years, and Bachelor’s with
Research after 4 years. ,

2. Interdisciplinary Courses: All undergraduate, post-
graduate, and PhD level courses will be interdisciplin-
ary, and M. Phil courses will be discontinued.

3, Academic Bank of Credits (ABC): A system ABC
will be established to facilitate the transfer of credits
between courses.

Higher Education Commission of India (HECI):

| HECI is the future of higher education in India as |]
| envisaged by Ministry of Education. The initial draft |
| bill for the HECI was introduced in Parliament in |)
| 2018 making it a ‘single regulator’, as an umbrella |
| body for the functions being carried out by UGC,

| AICTE, NCTE to name a few. Later, it was discussed |.

| in NEP, 2020. .

| There will be streamlined and more transparent |

| governance. The success depends upon effective
| implementation, transparent governance and fund-
| ing. There are concerns about the potential for
| increased centralization and loss of autonomy for
| universities. There are fears that a one-size-fits-all
| approach that might not cater to the specific needs
| of diverse institutions.

| Four Verticals of HECI: HECI will function through
technology-driven interventions and have the power
to penalize non-conforming institutions. HECI can
be thought of as a four-armed octopus, each arm
handling a different task:

1. National Higher Education Regulatory
Council (NHERC): The rule-maker, NHERC is
to set academic standards, approving institu-
tions, and monitoring compliance. This will
exclude medical and legal education.

2. National Accreditation Council (NAC): This
is actually the quality checker. Here, the "meta-
accrediting" term accurately reflects its role in
overseeing a network of independent accredit-
ing bodies. Accreditation wouldn't solely rely
on basic norms and self-disclosure. NAC would
also consider factors such as good governance,
student outcomes, employability, and research
output. ‘

3. National Higher Education Funding Council
(NHEFC): NHEFC is responsible for allocating
funding to institutions based on. performance
and national priorities. This NHEFC is some-
times referred as HEGC (Higher Education
Grants Council).

4. National Institute for Higher Education
Management (NIHEM): The curriculum boss,

designing what you learn and setting learning

goals. This is responsible for capacity building
of faculty and administrators, and providing
research and policy support.

. Phasing Out Affiliation System: The affiliation of
colleges will be phased out in 15 years, with graded
autonomy granted to colleges.

5. Increase in Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER): GER in
higher education will be taised to 50% by 2035, with the
addition of 3.5 crore seats. The current GER is 26.3%.

6. Teacher Education: The progress on new National
Curriculum Framework for Teacher Education
(NCFTE) is in progress. By 2030, the minimum quali-
fication for teaching will be a 4-year integrated B.Ed.
degree. The more stringent standards are to be set.

7. Integration of Professional Education: This will
becomie an integral part of higher education, and
standalone technical, health science, legal, and agri-
cultural universities will aim for multidisciplinarity.

8. Increased Investment: The Centre and States will
work together to increase public investment in educa-
‘tion to reach 6% of GDP at the earliest.

Other Changes

1. National Educational Technology Forum (NETF):
An autonomous body will be created to promote the
use of technology (mainly digital) in education.

2. PARAKH (Performance Assessment, Review, and
Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development):
This assessment center will evaluate students and
open avenues for foreign universities to establish
campuses in India. ;

3. Gender Inclusion Fund (GIF) and Special Education
Zones (SEZs): Emphasis will be placed on promoting
gender inclusion and addressing educational disparities
in disadvantaged regions and among various groups.

4. Virtual Labs: Existing e-learning platforms will be
leveraged to create virtual labs for practical and
hands-on learning experiences.



=== Page 149 ===
Increased Investment: The policy aims to increase
public investment in the education sector to reach
6% of GDP, although the current spending is around
4.6% of total GDP.

_ National Institutes: The following institutes have
been envisaged by National Education Policy (NEP)
2020 in India.

‘1.

Indian Institute of Translation and
Interpretation (IITI): To teach and research trans-
lation and interpretation. It will help translators
share ideas and promote Indian languages globally.
National Institute for Pali, Persian and Prakrit
(NIPPP): To teach languages like Pali, Persian,
and Prakrit. It will help keep India’s language her-
itage alive.

National Institute for Classical Languages
(NICL): To focus on India’s classical languages
like Sanskrit and Tamil. It will offer courses on
these languages.

Multidisciplinary Education and Research
Universities (MERUs): These new universities
will focus on different subjects. These universi-
ties, equivalent to IITs and IIMs, will be set up as
models of multidisciplinary education.

National Research Foundation (NRF): This
will fund research across all subjects. It will help
researchers work together and make India a
leader in research.

National Institute for Teacher Education

(NITE): This institute will create new teaching-

methods and supervise teacher training.
National Institute for Tribal Research (NITR):
This institute will research issues important to
tribal communities, like education and health.
National Institute for Higher Education
(NIHE): This institute will research topics related
to colleges and universities.

National Institute for Foundational Literacy
and Numeracy (NIFLN): This institute will focus
on basic reading, writing, and math skills.

OrtHODOX EDUCATION

° This is rooted in oral traditions, emphasizing values
like honesty, hospitality, charity, aversion to evil, and
love for good.

* This stresses the importance of Vedic literature
and Indian culture’s tenets such as tolerance, truth,
Ahimsa, peace, and non-aggression.

® This focus on a rational approach to elevate under.
standing from ignorance.

° This follows a structured learning process such as’
Sravana, Manana, Nidhyasana discussed earlier.

CONVENTIONAL EDUCATION

° This is a passive learning where students primarily ]js.
ten and follow teacher instructions.

® This focuses on acquiring knowledge, skills, and expe-
rience with a dedicated effort to master specific skills.

© There is requirement of core competence that comes
with examples, facts, arguments and text, a dedicated
time and effort, the purpose is to master defined skills |
and develop socially.

® This involves constant peer contact and control and
assessment by teachers. The group, individual and
whole class matters.

© This utilizes traditional teaching methods like verbal,
visual, and practical instruction. There are subject-
object relations.

Examples include the following:

Classroom lectures — chalk and talk

Standardized Testing — knowledge based on a uni
form curriculum

Group projects — with teacher playing the leading role
Test book learning — learning from textbooks and
teacher-provided materials.

Ag Ne

NON-CONVENTIONAL EDUCATION

° This embraces methods like distance and online
education.

¢ This encourages active learning, with students choos-
ing their work and pace.

© This aims for holistic development, including cogni-
tive, social, and psychological growth.

© There is limited peer contact, Promoting self-control
and self-assessment.

¢ This incorporates innovative teaching methods like
problem-solving, partial search, and brainstorming.

Examples include the following:

1. Project based learning - learn by doing

2. Flipped classrooms - learn new contents at home
and apply them in the classroom.

3. Self assessment - learners setting own learning
goals and evaluating own progress.

4. Collaborative Learning - work together to solve
problems, with the teacher facilitating rather
than leading.

5. Blended Learning- That is mixofonlineand offline.

Current SceENnaRIO OF EDUCATION IN INDIA

tioning of higher education institutions and coordi-
nate the roles of government, universities, and apex
regulatory agencies within the state.

3. Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE): This
board facilitates coordination and cooperation, thus
acts as a bridge between the central and state gov-
ernments in education planning, policy making and
implementation.

Asout Universities

1. The word ‘University’ is derived from the Latin word
‘Universitas’, meaning ‘a whole’. This means a special-
ized association of students and teachers. This institu-
tion of higher learning produces the product for vari-
ous fields, aiming to impart knowledge and wisdom
for personality development.

The main functions of a University are as follows:
e Instruction provision

e Conducting research and postgraduate studies
e Affiliation and extension services to colleges

2. Basic Scenario of University Education In India:

State Universities are established through Provincial or
State Acts. These universities are listed under Section
12(B) of the UGC Act, 1956, qualifying them for central
assistance.

° Development Grants: They receive development
grants and funds from special schemes to enhance
infrastructure, supplementing state government
support.

° Role of State Governments: While the primary fund-
ing responsibility lies with state governments, central
grants address funding gaps.

° Significance in Higher Education: State universi-
ties represent a significant portion of total universi-
ties in India and account for the majority of student
enrollment.

Private Universities in India

They are established through a state or central act by a
sponsoring body such as a registered society, public trust,
or company.

° Private universities can award degrees as per Section
22 of the UGC Act, subject to approval from statutory
councils for specific programs.

e The first private university in India, Sikkim Manipal
University of Health, Medical and Technological
Sciences, was established in Gangtok in 1995.

° They play a crucial role in diversifying and expanding
higher education, often introducing innovative pro-
grams and teaching methods.

Deemed-To-be Universities

A ‘deemed-to-be university,’ also commonly referred to as
a ‘deemed university,’ is an institution recognized for its
exceptional performance, officially designated by the cen-
tral government under Section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956.
Deemed universities can only attain approval through an
executive order following a recommendation from the
UGC. Although they possess all the powers of a typical
university, they lack the authority to affiliate colleges.

Historical Instances: The Indian Institute of Science
(IISc) in Bengaluru and the Indian Agricultural Research
Institute in Delhi were among the pioneering institutions
to be conferred with deemed status. The IISc achieved
this status in 1958, despite its establishment in 1908.
Additionally, the Manipal Academy of Higher Education
(MAHE) became the first private institution to attain
deemed university status in 1976.

Main Examples: Notable examples of deemed-to-be

-universities include:

° National University of Educational Planning and
Administration (NUEPA), located in New Delhi.

e Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, based in New Delhi.

e Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit
Vidyapeetha, situated in New Delhi.

° Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, located in Tirupati.

Additional Information

° The states with the highest number of universities are

Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.

e The 11th Five-Year Plan aimed to establish 14 world-
class central universities, later renamed as innovative
universities striving for world-class standards.

° In 2009, the P. N. Tandon Committee recommended
the blacklisting of 44 deemed universities due to their
perceived lack of required quality.

® Jn 2015, the UGC requested that 10 deemed universities,
including BITS Pilani, close their off-campus centers.

° In February 2016, the UGC amended its regulations,
allowing private deemed universities to have up to six
off-campuses. However, this limitation did not apply
to government-established and managed deemed
universities.

Funding: Deemed universities, along with central univer-
sities and institutions of national importance, primarily
receive funding from the federal government through the
UGC, with the National Open University being directly
funded by the Central government: ,

Meta University

This concept was initiated by UGC in India, represents an
innovative approach to higher education. These are key
points:

1. Second-Generation Universities: Meta Universities
go beyond traditional education models, focusing
on interdisciplinary studies and integrating various
knowledge domains.

2. Virtual Operation: They are not restricted by physi-
cal locations, operating mainly through digital plat-
forms, thus offering greater access and flexibility.

3. Innovation and Flexibility Focus: These universi-
ties are adaptable, embracing new teaching methods,
research areas, and technology.

The University of Delhi and Jamia Millia Islamia were the
first in India to adopt this model, starting a joint ‘Master
of Mathematics Education’ program in 2015, showcasing
collaboration and interdisciplinary education.

Institutes of Eminence (IOE)

India lacks in international rankings. There are different
reasons for that. Over a period, the government has done
many efforts to supplement the gap.

The Institutes of Eminence scheme comes under the
Ministry of Education to project Indian institutes to get global
recognition. The selected institutes will enjoy complete aca-
demic and administrative autonomy. The selection shall be
made through challenge method mode by the Empowered
Expert Committee (EEC) constituted for the purpose.

The ranking of institutions has been done by the UGC
as per the recommendations of QS-2020 World Rankings.

Objectives

e Excellence and innovation

° Specialization (distinctive contributions)
° Global rating

¢ Quality teaching and research

Criteria for setting up of IOEs

Eligibility: Only higher education institutions currently
placed in the top 500 of global rankings or top 50 of the
National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) are eli-
gible to apply for the eminence tag.

The private IOE can also come up as greenfield ventures,
provided that the sponsoring organisation submits a con-
vincing perspective plan for 15 years. Private institutions
will not get any financial support, but they will be entitled
for more autonomy as a special category Deemed University.

The greenfield institutions would get a period of 3
years to establish and operationalize the institution.

The UGC has nominated 20 institutions (10 public and 10
private institutions) for IOE in August 2019. The initial rankings
have 15 institutions each from public and private sector.

The top three declared IOE from the public sector are
the following:

1. IIT Bombay (IND
2. IIT Delhi GND
3. IISC, Bengaluru (deemed university)
The top three declared IOE from the private sector are
the following:
1. BITS Pilani, Rajasthan

| Classical Languages

} Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and
| Odia are the six classical languages in India. Tamil
| was the first language to be assigned the status of
| classical language in 2004. Odia was the last one to
| be assigned the status in February 2014, but it is the
| first language from the Indo-Aryan linguistic group
|, to be assigned the status.

! The Sahitya Academy’s Expert Committee gave
| the following four criteria for a classical language:

1. There should be high antiquity of early texts/
recorded history of over 1500-2000 years.

2. There should be a body of ancient literature/
texts that is considered a valuable heritage by |
generations of speakers.

3. The literary tradition should be original and not |
borrowed from another speech community.

4. The classical language and literature should be |
distinct from the modern and there may also be |

a discontinuity between the classical languag

and its later forms of offshoots.

The proposals are made by the Ministry of Culture
Once a language is declared classical, it gets finan
cial assistance for setting up a centre of excellenc
for the study of that language and also opens up a
avenue for two major awards for scholars of emi
nence. Besides, the UGC can be requested to creat
to begin with at least in central universities a certain
number of professional chairs for classical language
for scholars of eminence in that language.

The fathers of the Constitution conferred
Sanskrit special status by Article 351 as it wa
the primary source language for many language
including Hindi.

Five languages in the world, namely, Chinese
Sanskrit, Arabic, Greek and Latin, have been assigned
the status of classical languages.

Implications:

e Autonomy: Institutes with IOEtag will be given greater
autonomy and freedom to decide fees, course durations
and governance structures to enable them to vault of the
top global institutions. They would be able to admit for-
eign students and recruit faculty from abroad.

e Grant: The public institutions under IOE tag will receive
a government grant of %1000 crore, while the private
institutions will not get any funding under the scheme.

India has six language universities, out of which three
are deemed-to-be universities and three are central
universities. The deemed-to-be universities are for the
promotion of Sanskrit and the three central universities
are, one each, for the promotion of English and foreign
language, Hindi and Urdu.

The UGC is providing funds to the following language
universities:

1. Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri
Vidyapeetha, New Delhi

Rashtriya Sanskrit

2. Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati
3. English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad

- Accreditation is a. crucial mechanism for assessing and
assuring the quality of higher education institutions and
programs. In India, several accreditation bodies play a
vital role in maintaining standards and promoting excel-
lence across diverse disciplines.

NATIONAL ASSESSMENT AND Accrepitation CouNciL

India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).

© This conducts evaluations of technical courses in
India. ;

e NBA has the power to recognize or derecognize insti-
tutions or programs.

e The accreditation process by the NBA is not directly
linked to funding.

Accreoitation Boarp (AB)

e AB was established by the Indian Council of
Agricultural Research (ICAR) in 1996.

e AB is responsible for accrediting agricultural

states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have made it
mandatory for professional institutions.
° Despite the importance, accreditation rates remain
low. Only 36% of engineering and 10% of manage-
ment programs are NBA accredited.

Open anp Distance Learning (ODL)

ODL in India, as outlined by the Ministry of Education
plays a pivotal role in expanding the reach and accessibil-
ity of education. The key points are as follows:

1. Nature and Objectives of ODL: ODL is a part of
non-conventional education where physical presence
of teachers and learners at the same place and time
is not necessary. It offers flexibility in teaching and
learning methods, timings, and admission criteria,
while maintaining quality standards.

The primary goals include democratizing higher edu-
cation, providing innovative university-level educa-
tion, offering opportunities for skill upgradation and |
qualifications, and fostering lifelong learning.

2, Philosophy of ODL: Open learning focuses on mini-

mizing restrictions to maximize openness in educa-
tion. It is an educational philosophy aiming to make
learning accessible to more people.
Distance education operationalizes the philosophy of
open learning. It encompasses all teaching and learn-
ing where the learner and the teacher are separated
by space and time.

3. Communication’ Methods: The curriculum interac-
tion takes place in an interesting manner. In distance



=== Page 160 ===
10.34

learning, curriculum is mostly delivered through self-
study materials. Technology plays a crucial role in
facilitating this.

The Interaction between institutions, teachers, and
learners is predominantly through electronic media
like telephone, interactive radio counselling, telecon-
ferencing, video conferencing, chat sessions, email,
and websites. Postal correspondence and limited
face-to-face sessions at study centres are also used.

4. India’s Position in DE: India has one of the largest
distance education systems in the world, second only
to China.

5. Types of DE Institutions in India:

1. National Open University: For example, the
Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU
is a prominent institution. .
2. State Open Universities: These are open univer-
sities established by various state governments.

HisToRICAL Perspective of Distance Epucation
IN. INDIA

The below is the pointwise historical journey of Distance
Education in India.

e 1962: Delhi University started the ‘School of
Correspondence Courses and Continuing Education’.
This was the start of distance education in higher edu-
cation in India.

° Late 1960s: More universities like Punjabi University,
Rajasthan University, Meerut University and Mysore
University joined the journey by offering similar courses
to cater to the demand of correspondence courses.

e Education Commission (1964-66): The Kothari
Commission recognized correspondence courses as a
way to support more students and ease financial pres-
sure on traditional universities.

* 1970s: Distance education spread across India, mak-
ing education more accessible.

° 1980s & National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986:
The government introduced the Open University System
(OUS) and the NPE emphasized OUS for expanding
higher education opportunities. There was establish-
ment of pioneering institutions like Dr. B.R. Ambedkar
Open University in Hyderabad (1982) and the Indira
Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) (1985).

Role of Distance Education Council (DEC) and
Transition to UGC
° 1991 & DEC Establishment: The Distance Education
Council was established under the IGNOU Act, becom.
ing operational in 1992. It was tasked with Promotin
and coordinating Open and Distance Learning (ODL)
in India. ;
¢ Regulatory Shift (2010-2012): A committee chaired
by Prof. Madhava Menon was formed by the Ministry
of Human Resource Development (MHRD) to regu-

late standards in distance education. It recommended

the creation of a new regulatory body, the Distance
Education Council of India (DECI), and proposed shift.
ing DEC's responsibilities from IGNOU to the UGC. By
2013, the UGC took over these functions under the
newly formed Distance Education Bureau (DEB).

° 2014 Onwards: The Ministry of Education directed
the UGC to regulate all higher education in Opy,
mode, including technical education. The UGC, under
the DEB, is now the primary regulatory body for dis.
tance and open learning in India, ensuring the main-
tenance of standards and quality in universities and
affiliated colleges.

° Thus, the landscape of distance education has evolved
significantly from its inception in 1962, reflecting a
dynamic and responsive approach to the educational
needs of the country.

Inpira Gano Nationa Open University (IGNOU) -

° IGNOU is a central university located in New Delhi,
India, specializing in distance and open education. This
was established in 1985 to provide quality higher edu-
cation opportunities to all segments of society through
distance and open learning. With over 4 million active
students, IGNOU is the largest university globally.

° IGNOU offers a diverse array of programs, from aca-
demic to technical, professional, and vocational at
various levels.

° InternationalCollaboration: HoststheSecretariatsof
the SAARC Consortium on Open and Distance Learning
(SACODiL) and the Global Mega Universities Network
(GMUNET), with initial support from UNESCO.

° Use of ICTs: Extensively uses Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs) for education.
Utilizes self-instructional materials, audio/video tapes,
teleconferencing, Gyan Vani (FM Radio), Gyan Darshan
(educational TV channels), and computer networks.

° SAKSHAT Portal: Operates the ‘One Stop Education
’ Portal SAKSHAT’.

e Decentralization Process: Initiated decentraliza-
tion by setting up five zones: north, south, east, west,
and north-east, with 10% of the budget allocated for
northeastern states. ~

¢ Dual Role: Functions both as an Open University
and as a promoter and coordinator of the Open and
Distance Education system in India.

The COL is an intergovernmental organization
established by the Commonwealth countries in
1988 to encourage development and sharing of
open learning and distance education knowledge,
resources and technologies.

The COL was hosted in Canada by the
Government of Canada. The major voluntary con-
tributors currently are Canada, India, New Zealand,
Nigeria, South Africa and the United Kingdom,
where each are entitled to seats on the COL’s Board
of Governors. The following Indian organizations
are partners of the COL for different purposes:

ernment.

There is a huge demand for professional, technical and
skill development education in the modern age of science
and technology. The new role for educational institutions
found it necessary to redefine its goal mainly related to
economic development and to ensure a place for India in
the community of prosperous nations.

A profession is a vocation founded upon specialized
educational training, the purpose of which is to supply
counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite
compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other
business gain.

A profession arises when any trade or occupation
transforms itself through ‘the development of formal
qualifications based on education, apprenticeship, and
examinations, the emergence of regulatory bodies with
powers to admit and discipline members, and some
degree of monopoly rights.’

The need for professional education has only increased
with changing needs of society and economy.

The professional regulatory. bodies grant approval for
establishment of institutes and determine standards for
the same. Some of the specialized professional bodies are
Medical Council of India, Dental Council of India, Council
of Architecture, the details of which are mentioned on
page 10.23.

Thus, a significant part of the Indian higher education
system is regulated. However, there are certain areas that
are not.



=== Page 162 ===
NEES ES % cos
Technical education imparts knowledge ofa a specific trade,
craft or profession. It can meet the increasing demands
of expanding society and it is multiplying demands and
development.

To train our students/professionals in response to the
need of the time, our education system must be reor-
ganized to give it the necessary practical and technical
bias. The Government of India is also very keen for uni-
versal recognition of our education-system, and because
of that, all universities are trying hard to get the NBA
accreditation.

We find that in a zeal to cope with the advancement
of science and technology, our technical education system
has become primarily skill-oriented and almost deficient
or casual in the education in human values.

TECHNICAL EoucaTION SCENARIO IN INDIA

In India, technical education covers programmes in engi-
neering, technology, management, architecture, town
planning, pharmacy, applied arts and crafts, and hotel
management and catering technology.

1. The first engineering college was established in Uttar
Pradesh in 1847 for training of civil engineers at Roor-
kee. It conferred diplomas that were considered to be
equivalent to degrees.

2. Three engineering colleges were opened by about
1856 in three presidencies, namely, Calcutta, Bombay
and Madras.

3. In Bengal, the leaders of the Swadeshi Movement tried
to start many institutions. However, only the College of
Engineering and Technology at Jadavpur survived.

4, Many technical courses were started at the University

of Banaras with great efforts put by Pandit Madan -

Mohan Malviya (1917).

5, Many other courses were also started at the Bengal
Engineering College at Shibpur in the 1930s.

6. A number of engineering colleges were established
since 15 August 1947. It was due to the realization
that India had to become a great industrial country
and would require a large number of engineers than
could be supplied by the older institutions.

the JIMs are a group of 20 public, autonomous institutes of
management education and research in India. They primar-
jy offer postgraduate, doctoral and executive education

rogrammes. The establishment of IIMs was initiated by

on the recommendation of the Planning Commission.
The following is the list of the first six IIMs:

IIM Kozhikode—1996

* JIM Indore—1996

In the second and third generations of IIMs, six insti-
tutes each were opened.

As we discussed, they have been set up under different
acts of the Parliament. The Lok Sabha passed the IIM Bill
2017 to make IIMs the INI. It allows IIMs greater autonomy
and empowers them to grant degrees instead of diplomas.

Value education is an integral part of the educational
framework, aimed at the holistic development of individ-
uals and society. Here’s a summary of key developments
and perspectives in value education in India:
¢ Broader Aim of Value Education:
1. Individual’s Perspective: Achieving personal
fulfillment and success in life and work.
2. Societal Perspective: Preparing youth to con-
tribute positively to society, the nation, and the
world.

° Historical Perspective: Plato’s view in ‘The Republie

highlights the role of educated individuals in using
their knowledge to solve societal problems.

THe Neep ror Vatue Epucation

The need for imparting value education arises from sey.
eral contemporary issues and societal changes. Here are
the main issues:

1.

Tradition versus Modernity: We need to strike a bal.
ance between traditional values and modernization.
Value education helps young learners appreciate posj-
tive aspects of tradition, such as tolerance, harmony,
and collectivism, while also embracing beneficia]
aspects of modernization.

. Globalization: With societies becoming increasingly

multicultural, individuals must learn to navigate a
complex and diverse global environment. Value edu-
cation can help in understanding and respecting dif-
ferent cultures.

. Diversity: Balancing universality and diversity, is a

challenge in a democratic and diverse society. Value
education promotes respect and understanding of
various cultural, social, and religious backgrounds.

. Inclusivity: A healthy society is inclusive, making all

members feel valued and involved. Value education
fosters a sense of belonging and acceptance among
individuals.

. Environmental Concerns: Issues like global warm-.

ing, pollution, deforestation, and soil erosion high-
light the need for environmental consciousness.
Value education emphasizes the ethical responsibility
towards sustainable environmental practices.

. Explosion of Science and Technology: The ethical

use of science and technology is critical. Value educa-
tion addresses the moral and ethical responsibilities
associated with the application of scientific and tech-
nological advancements.

. Impact of Mass and Social Media: The pervasive -

influence of media in daily life often transmits values
and attitudes contrary to those upheld by families,
schools, and society. Value education helps individu-
als critically evaluate media content and its impact on
values and behaviour.

Key DEVELOPMENTS IN VALUE EDUCATION

1.

National Commission of Secondary Education
(1952-53): Emphasized character building as the
primary goal of education.

. University Education Commission (1962):.

Highlighted the importance of spiritual training in
educational institutions.

. Education Commission (1964-66): Focused on

education for national development and recom-
mended direct moral instruction in schools.

. National Policy on Education (NPE, 1986):

Advocated using education as a tool for cultivat-
ing social and moral values, emphasizing unity and
integration.

firmed commitment to equality, diversity, and mutual
interdependence, emphasizing education for peace as
a crucial national and global concern.

These developments reflect the evolving understand-
ing and incorporation of value education in India’s edu-
cational system, recognizing its importance in shaping
responsible, ethical, and socially conscious individuals.

in areas like research, reputation, and faculty quality as
discussed above also. Thus, governance does matter.

Governance marks a shift from traditional government
paradigms, indicating a new process or method of govern-
ing, ora transformed state of structured ruling. It involves
the various ways society is managed and organized.

Diverse §NTERPRETATIONS OF GOVERNANCE

® Minimal State: Refers to a governance model where
the state plays a limited role, intervening only when
necessary.

* Corporate Governance: Involves the structures and
processes for the direction and control of companies.

* New Public Management: A perspective that empha-
sizes efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in
the public sector.

® Good Governance: Entails effective, transparent,
accountable, and ethical management in the public
sector.

° International Interdependence: Governance as shaped
by global interdependencies and international relations.

° Socio-Cybernetic System: Viewing governance as a
complex, adaptive system that involves social dynam-
ics and information feedback loops.

* Networks: Governance through collaborative net-
works and decentralized decision-making.

Goop GoveRNANCE IN HiGHER EDUCATION

1. Collaborative Governance Framework: Governance
in education brings together UGC, universities, NAAC,
NBA, and key institutions. They work together through
dialogue and partnership. The stated principles are
democratic but then decision making is cumbersome.

2. Principles of Good Governance: This focuses on imple-
menting educational policies effectively and fairly. It is
based on past reforms and the New Education Policy.
The goal is to improve both public life and education.

3. Strategic Restructuring and Collaboration: This
involves reshaping government bodies to focus on
social goals. It also means working together with the
state, private sector, NGOs, and community groups.
The approach uses diverse strategies, like socio-
cybernetic systems and networks.

4. Societal Impact and Development: Good gover-
nance in education is crucial for societys growth.
It supports a balanced role for the state in making
impactful educational changes and policies.

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF UNIVERSITIES IN [NDIA

1. Historical Roots: India has strong roots of education.
Ancient Indian education was influenced by Vedanta,
Buddhism, and Jainism. This era led to India being
known as Jagat Guru’. The government aims to retain
elements of this ancient system in modern education.

2. British Influence: The current university system has
its origins in British colonial rule.

_Let’s start with an example, India has a large higher ° Early Institutions: There is a big list of establish-

ducation system but no Indian institutions ranked in the ments such as Calcutta Madrasa (1781), Asiatic

op 200 globally. That indicates need for improvement Society of Bengal (1784), Banaras Sanskrit



=== Page 168 ===
10.42

College (1791) among others which were
founded during this period.

° British Parliament’s Role: The Charter Act of
1813 declared Indian education a duty of the state.

e Macaulay’s Minute of 1835: This gave priority to
British-style education in India.

° Establishment of Universities: In 1857, universi-

. ties in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras were estab-

lished, modeled on the University of London. The
University of Allahabad, established in 1887, was
more graduate-focused.

¢ Cultural Colonization: The British used the uni-
versity system as a tool for cultural influence.

Post-Colonial Shift: The Government of India Act of

1935 began the process of ‘Indianisation’ of educa-

tion, transferring more control to provincial govern-

ments and marking the end of British dominance over

the Indian education system.

Post-INDEPENDENCE DEVELOPMENT IN HIGHER
EDUCATION IN INDIA

1.

Continuity and Change: The shift in higher educa-
tion after independence continued from the pre-inde-
pendence era. Initially, higher education was primar-
ily for the elite, but post-independence goals aimed to
make it accessible to the wider Indian public.

: Expansion and Inclusion:

Numerous new universities were established to
expand educational opportunities.

* Diverse courses and professional studies were
introduced, leading to the establishment of pre-
mier institutions like IITs, BITS-Pilani, regional
engineering colleges, and IIMs.

e National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian
Institutes of Science (IISc), and Indian Institutes
of Science Education and Research (IISERs) were
developed.

Focus on Languages and Humanities: These fields

gained prominence up until the 1980s.

Further Growth in the 1990s and 2000s:

° This period saw the establishment of new IITs and
IIMs.

° Despite this expansion, the organizational struc-
ture of universities, largely based on the principle
of affiliation, remained largely unchanged.

Governance and Administrative Bodies:

° Most Indian universities maintained an affiliation
system, aiming for efficient governance of con-
stituent and affiliated colleges.

° Statutory bodies were established to govern these
institutions.

Types of Universities:

The Indian higher education system comprises
mainly two types of universities:

® Unitary universities: focus on teaching and
research within a single campus.

° Affiliating universities: They have a central cam-
pus for postgraduate instruction and research, with
several affiliated colleges spread across districts

FUNDING AND Types OF COLLEGES IN INDIAN
Hicguer Epucation System
1. University Funding:

Most Indian universities receive funding from
Central or State governments.

° Some deemed universities are sponsored by pri.
vate trusts, like Birla Institute of Technology ang
Science, Pilani, and Thapar University, Patiala,

° Private universities, set up under Acts of ©
Legislatures, include Sikkim- Manipal University
and Amity University in Chattisgarh.

2. Colleges and Their Types:

A significant portion of undergraduate teaching

occurs in colleges.

e Colleges are categorized as:

(i) Constituent Colleges: Established and man-
aged directly by the university.

(ii) Affiliated Colleges: Set up and managed
outside the university, often by the govern-
ment or educational trusts, with affiliation
granted by the universities in consultation
with the government.

3. Sources of University Funding: University income in

India comes from the following.
° Central Government grants.
° State Government grants.
® Student fees.
¢ Endowments.and donations.
¢ Support from specialized agencies.

4. Types of Grants:

e State government grants to universities are
divided into:

(i) Maintenance/Block Grants: For routine
operations, including salaries. They are
adjusted periodically based on cost changes.

(ii) Non-recurring Grants: Used for infra-
structural needs like buildings and equip-
ment. Land is usually provided by the State
government.

(iii) Development Grants: For new schemes,
often matched by the university for vari-
ous activities, especially those sponsored by
federal/state governments and channelled
through the UGC.

e Central government provides grants for general
and developmental purposes through the UGC.
When states become responsible for grants,
financial challenges may arise.

(SEAO) region.

The Rank of India: India is positioned 40th out of 132
Nations. That ranking was 81st in 2015. The improve-
ment in GII is attributed to its rich knowledge capital, a

lic and private research organizations. Our response
to Covid-19 pandemic and its commitment to the Atma
Nirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India) were innovative.

Science and Technology Clusters (S & T Clusters):
The most significant S&T clusters are Tokyo-Yokohama,
Shenzhen—Hong Kong~Guangzhou, Seoul, Beijing, and
Shanghai-Suzhou. The rank of China was 21st and USA
was 21, thus China surpassed USA.

India has only four S&T clusters in the top 100 (Chennai,
Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi), compared to China’s 24
and the USA’s 21.

tion in key sectors like electric vehicles, biotechnology,
nanotechnology, space, and alternative energy sources.
