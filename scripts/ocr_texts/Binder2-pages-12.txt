Read the given passage carefully and answer the five
questions that follow:

Many great inventions are initially greeted with ridi-
cule and disbelief. The invention of the airplane was
no exception. Although many people who heard about
the first powered flight on December 17, 1903, were
excited and impressed, others reacted with peals of
laughter. The idea of flying an aircraft was repulsive
to some people. Such people called Wilbur and Orville
Wright, ‘the inventors of the first flying machine’,
impulsive fools. Negative reactions, however, did not
stop the Wrights. Impelled by their desire to succeed,
they continued their experiments in aviation.

Orville and Wilbur Wright always had a compel-
ling interest in aeronautics and mechanics. As young

boys, they earned money by making and selling kites

and mechanical toys. Later, they designed a newspa- _

per-folding machine, built a printing press, and oper-
ated a bicycle repair shop. In 1896, when they read
about the death of Otto Lilienthal, the brothers’ inter-
est in flight grew into a compulsion.

Lilienthal, a pioneer in hang-gliding, had con-
trolled his gliders by shifting his body in the desired
direction. This idea was repellent to the Wright broth-
ers, however, they searched for more efficient meth-
ods to control the balance of airborne vehicles. In
1900 and 1901, the Wrights tested numerous glid-
ers and developed control techniques. The brothers’
inability to obtain enough lift power for the gliders
almost led them to abandon their efforts.

_ After further study, the Wright brothers con-
cluded that the published tables of air pressure on

curved surfaces must be wrong. They set up a wind ©

tunnel and began a series of experiments with model
wings. Because of their efforts, the old tables were
repealed in time and replaced by the first reliable fig-
ures for air pressure on curved surfaces. This work,
in turn, made it possible for the brothers to design
a machine that would fly. In 1903, the Wrights built
their first airplane, which cost less than $1,000. They
even designed and built their own source of propul-
sion — a lightweight gasoline engine. When they
started the engine on December 17, the airplane pul-
sated wildly before taking off. The plane managed to
stay aloft for 12 seconds, however, and it flew 120
feet.

By 1905, the Wrights had perfected the first air-
plane that could turn, circle, and remain airborne for

HINTS AND SOLUTIONS

From the question, it seems that we should try to get basic information first of all by making use of

some direct or shortcut methods. There are multiple options.

B. 28% 392

D. 26%  364-

Basic calculations which apply in all the questions:
14
Cars in State A = 14% of 1400 = Too * 1400 = 196

Cars in State B = 28% of 1400, that means double of 196
= 2 X 196 = 392

Cars in State C = Cars in State B + 4% of 1400 = 392 +
56 = 448 ,

Cars in State D = Cars in State B - 2% of
1400 = 392 — 28 = 364

We can take summation of the numbers to see that it
equals 1400
1. (b): The number of diesel engine cars in State
B= 182
The number of petrol engine cars in State D = 140
Difference = 182-140 = 42
2. (a): The number of petrol engine cars in State
C= 168
The number of diesel engine cars in State A = 84
Difference = 168 — 84 = 84

84
Percentage difference = Bq X 100 = 100%

3. (d): The number of AC cars in State C = 25% of
280 = 70
The number of non-AC cars = 280 — 70 = 210

4. (d):
The number of total cars in State C = 448
The number of petrol engine cars in State B = 252
The difference = 448 — 252 = 196

5. (ce):
The number of Petrol engine cars in all states = 112 +
252 + 168 + 182 = 714

6. (b): A flowchart is a diagram that depicts a process,
system or computer algorithm. It is used for visual
representation of data flow. Flowcharts use rectangles,
ovals, diamonds and potentially numerous other shapes
to define the type of step, along with connecting arrows
to define flow and sequence. Flowcharts were used to

document business, specifically by Frank and Lillian
Gilbreth. They are used in any field such as-education,
business, manufacturing, engineering, architecture,
etc. Few examples have been shown below

- (d): Integral Education-The concept of Integral

Education was given by Sri Aurobindo that is based
on the belief that the education of a human being
should begin at birth and continue throughout his
life. The main objective of any kind of education is
to ensure the realization of the inner potential of the
learner. Thus, this concept is quite dynamic and flex-
ible, it takes into account the whole personality of
the learner, through the concept of dealing with the
‘whole child’. This takes into account the individual
curiosity, passion and compassion, and this applies
to all situations in a beautiful manner. There are
integral schools at many places in India as enunci-
ated by Sri Aurobindo and his spiritual companion
Mirra Alfassa ~ known as mother.

Focus on spiritual aspects of Indian philosophy-
This is associated with Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan’s
metaphysics that is based on Sankara’s Advaita (non-
dual) Vedanta tradition (sampradaya). He was asso-
ciated with Prasthanatraya (main primary texts of
Vedanta), Upanishads, Brahma Sutra, and the Bhaga-
vad Gita. He was greatly influenced by the writings
and work of Swami Vivekananda.

Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan was actively involved
in the works of UNESCO. He was known for being a
bridge between eastern and western philosophies to



=== Page 6 ===
promote world unity and universal fellowship. To Dr
Radhakrishnan — ‘The idea of God is an interpreta-
tion of experience’.

Learning to take place in nature and from nature-
Sri Rabindranath Tagore believed in complete free-
dom of every kind for the students in terms of his
intellectual level, decision making, feelings, knowl-
edge, etc. The independence means normalcy or
the fact of being natural. There should be harmony
between man, God and nature. There is need to prac-
tice equanimity, harmony and balance.

Experiential Learning-In John Dewey’s experien-
tial learning theory, everything occurs within a social
environment. Knowledge is socially constructed and
based on experiences. This knowledge should be
organized in real-life experiences that provide a con-
text for the information. The names of other great per-
sonalities such as David Kolb, Kurt Lewin, and Jean
Piaget can be associated with experiential learning.

. (b): Every learner (in fact, an individual) is unique. This
also gives rise to the concept of ‘individual differences’.
Every learner has her/his own characteristics. For a
teacher, the individual differences in the form of vari-
ables such as physical characteristics, intelligence, per-
ception, gender, ability, learning styles are important. A
more effective and productive learning-teaching process
can be planned by a teacher with this kind of knowledge.

Assessments are a useful way of maintaining qual-
ity. Assessments assess students’ understanding,
knowledge, and takeaways from the educational
experience. Assessments make learning process more
effective and enhance student development. Usually,
the assessments make use of empirical data.

Summative Assessment-This evaluates the overall
learning of the students at the end of a unit or course.
This assessment compares against some standardized
criteria or benchmark. These are basically formal in
nature which help in awarding a certificate also. This
assessment can be written assessment (writing an orig-
inal piece, such as a narrative or analytical essay), per-
formance assessment (to do an activity or task that will
showcase the abilities of the learners), standardized
assessment (an exam created for a given curriculum)
or oral assessment (such as a speech or presentation).

Formative Assessment-This assessment measures
how a student is learning during a course of study.
The goal is to monitor student learning to provide
ongoing feedback that can be used by instructors to
improve their teaching and by students to improve
their learning. This word can be linked with actual
formation of career of a student in the class.

‘Diagnostic Assessment-A diagnostic assessment is
an evaluation of a child’s knowledge and skill level

10.

of a certain topic. These assessments are done at the
start of the topic to understand how much students
already know about the subject.

Peer Assessment: This assessment provides a struc-

‘tured learning process for students to critique and

provide feedback to each other on their work. Thus,
students develop lifelong skills. It equips them with
skills to self-assess and improve their own work.

. (b): e-PG Pathshala-The UGC has launched an e-PG

Pathshala Project for standardizing the textbook mate-
rials for MA, MSc and MCom courses in different uni-
versities of India. In India, e-PG Pathshala is such an
innovation maintained by UGC-INFLIBNET and funded
by Ministry of Education. As part of its National Educa-
tion Mission through ICT (NME-ICT), itis a wide e-learn-
ing platform in terms of its subject material and breadth
of use as well.

On the other hand, Ministry of Education (earlier
MHRD) launched ‘e-pathshala’ web portal to host
educational resources for students, teachers, par-
ents, researchers and educators. This is a single point
repository of e- resources containing NCERT text-
books and various other learning resources.

The affective domain is one of the three domains in
Bloom’s Taxonomy. The affective domain as described by
Krathwohl, Bloom, Masia in the year 1973, includes the
manner in which we deal with things emotionally, such
as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms, motiva-
tions, and attitudes. As per question, they have been put
in the following five categories (for future questions):

1. Receiving
(a) awareness of the action
(b) desire to achieve action
(c) controlled attention to action
2. Response (responding)
(a) In response to an agreement
(b) Desire to respond
(c) Response Contentment
3. Evaluation (valuing)
(a) Acceptance of value (valuing)
(b) Priority of value
(c) Commitment
4. Organizing (managing)
(a) Concept of values
(b) Price system organization
5. Specialization
(a) Higher evaluation by peers to do
(b) Normal group
(c) Specialization
In option (b), analysing means dividing a topic into parts
for the sake of understanding and also synthesising
means integrating the parts into a consolidated form.

41.(d): A variable is any quantity that a researcher is able
to measure in some way. This could be temperature,
height, age, etc. Basically, a variable is anything that
contributes to the outcome or result of your experi-
ment in any way. ,

Control Variable-A control variable is anything that
is held constant or limited in a research study. It’s a
variable that is not of interest to the study’s aims, but
is controlled because it could influence the outcomes.
For example, one control variable in the plant growth
experiment could be temperature. Assume that this
should be kept uniform at 25° C, so it is the duty of
researcher to keep it at this uniform level.

External variable~These variables are factors that
are not manipulated as part of an experiment, but
they may exert some influence on the dependent vari-
able under study.

Confounding Variable—This is an unmeasured third
variable that ‘confounds’ (or influences) the relation-
ship between an independent and a dependent vari-
able. It actually suggests the presence of a spurious
correlation. Confounding is a causal concept, and as
such, cannot be described in terms of correlations or
associations.

(b): Monadic variable is basically used in the sur-
vey research that offers individual concepts to sur-
vey respondents in isolation-one at a time. The
independent findings are required for each stimu-
lus. They provide clear detailed feedback. This is
available with every automated tool. This can be
compared with polyadic variables. In comparison
testing several stimuli are tested simultaneously.

(c): There are two kinds of variables-Qualitative and
Quantitative

Qualitative Variables—This is also called as a categor-
ical variable. As the name indicates, it is not numeri-
cal. This describes data that fits into categories. These
are all qualitative variables as they have no natural
order.

The examples are
Skin colours—White, Yellow, Brown, Black
States—-Haryana, Punjab, Manipur, Kerala

Quantitative variables~They have a value and they
can be added, subtracted, divided or multiplied.

Now look at the detailed discussion in context of its
disadvantages.

A. Too sensitive to context-The main objective of
qualitative or any kind of research is to connect
with the theme or basic idea. It is basically behav-
ioural in nature.

B. Open To Debate-tt is also positive reflection as it
is linked with the transparency.

C. Too subjective-Qualitative can always be some-
what subjective but being too much subjective is
its negative characteristic as the personal view-
point becomes very important.

i



=== Page 8 ===
D. Difficult to generalise-Though generalisation
is the main objective of any kind of research but
qualitative lacks in that.

E. Issue of replication—There are always less and less
chances of replication so that the generalisation also
becomes difficult. Thus, this can be taken as the dis-
advantage of qualitative research.

14. (a): The word ‘sample’ mostly applies in the case of

15

research. Thus, the word project can be taken as research
project. Sample helps us in finding the truth or getting
us very close to the truth. Sample size calculation and
determination are imperative to the researcher to deter-
mine the right number of respondents, keeping in mind
the research study’s quality.

The sample is the miniature version of the population
that reflects the desired features. That helps us in sav-
ing time and associated costs.

In qualitative studies, the study is mostly subjective,
and the sample size may have to be kept small as we
want to do their detailed analysis.

Thus, the population size matters, so is the confidence
level (90%, 95% or 99% to reflect upon the accuracy
and confidence of results), the margin of error (confi-
dence interval), standard deviation from mean (also
called as sigma that reflects upon the variability of a
distribution of population) — all these things matter to
a researcher.

Necessary Sample Size = (Z-score)2 * StdDev*(1-
StdDev) / (margin of error)?

The precision of obtaining the results from popula-
tion may ask for changing the sample size. Thus, the
population variability is important. If the popula-
tion is homogeneous, a researcher can manage with
smaller sample and vice versa. We have to determine
if the increased accuracy is more important than the
cost.

There can be probability (random and objective) or
non-probability (non random and more subjective)
sampling techniques.

The choices D and E are not or least important for a
researcher as research should always be objective.

(b): Meta-analysis intends to take a quick review
of multiple research studies on basically the same or
closely related problem or issue. combines the results
of multiple scientific studies. It is basically a quanti-
tative, formal, epidemiological study design that is
based on randomized, controlled trials.

Content Analysis—this is basically used in qualitative
studies where the answers may be subjective which
are based on the personal opinion. The language used
by the respondents in the qualitative research (such as

16.

17

.

18.

case studies) may be different and a researcher neeq
to find the basic idea or description. This is called con.
tent analysis. .

Semantic Differential-A semantic differential can
be used for the structuring of attitudes, most likely
in qualitative studies. This survey or questionnaire
rating scale asks people to rate a product, event, or
any ‘entity’ within the frames of a multi-point rating
option. These survey answering options are gram-
matically on opposite adjectives at each end. As they
are opposite to each other on the two ends of a con-
tinuum, this may be called as bipolar adjective.

Social Network Analysis—The dyad definition is the
close relationship of two people over a long period
with many interactions in different settings. The most
basic requirement for dyad sociology is that there are
two members of the group. The dyadic communica-
tion definition pertains to how the two group mem-
bers interact with each other. German sociologist
Georg Simmel studied how group dynamics changed
based on the size of the group.

(a): The word effective in communication means that
a message has been sent and received properly with
an understanding. That understanding is reflected
by ‘feedback’. In a classroom, an effective listener is
completely focused and thus tries to resist any kind of
distraction (or noise) that exists in the environment.

Message filtering in communication may actually be
perceived as a communication, as some fact is kept
hidden, distorted or manipulated with an objective to
manage receiver’s reaction. For example, a manager
tries to hide the poor sales figures of his division so
that the receiver (boss) does not get angry.

(a): This question is about face to face communica-
tion but different levels have been given by different
authors. In two way communication, the sender of
message gets the feedback from the receiver, that ful-
fils the basic objective of communication. The main
objective of communication is understanding the
message in the intended form.

Our answer is Level 1 as the communication is two
way and Face to Face between two persons. There can
be higher channels as per the channels involved.

The verbal,. physical, auditory, emotional and
energetic are also described as the five levels of
communication.

(b): Time Sense-This is linked with temporal aspect
linked with culture. Western cultures, even South East
Asia tend to measure their time by the clock, keeping
in view that each activity should have a precise begin-
ning and end that may be termed as linear timing. To
them, the word ‘deadline’ is very important. Western-

ers also see that time has a limited supply, so they
structure that accordingly.

In India, there is a concept of rebirth (punrjanam), we
assume that if something could not be completed in
this birth, will be completed in next birth. India has
the concepts of satya yug, dwapar yug, treta yug and
kaliyug, according to different time spans and culture
makes a shift accordingly. In most parts of India, Paki-
stan, Bangladesh. etc. a culture is event or personality-
related. The culture also travels if we look at history.
Some practices which were part of Greece travelled
to India and vice versa. Thus, the institutions such as
marraige become institutional.

Level of Gratitude-This is an integral part of cul-
ture According to Robert Emmons as he expressed
in his book Thanks, ‘Gratitude is literally one of the
few things that can measurably change people’s
lives’. Gratitude can improve our health and rela-
tionships—making it one of the most well-studied
and effective ways to increase our well-being in
life. This level of gratitude varies according to our
culture such as India, China, Russia, Japan, Ger-
many, etc. There can be high context, low context,
temporal context, emotive context, directive, phatic
contexts of different cultures which have been men-
tioned in Pearson Unit 3.

They found some similarities across cultures, as well
as some differences—an initial glimpse at how our
early steps toward gratefulness might be shaped by
larger societal forces. There can be Verbal or oral grat-
itude, concrete gratitude (offering toffee, chocolate,
etc) and connective gratitude (offer of friendship or
help, etc).

(c): Statement 1~Small group communication refers
to interactions among three or more people who are
connected through a common purpose, mutual influ-
ence, and a shared identity which indicate the rela-
tionship needs. The upper number of a small group is
taken between 15 to 20.

Statement 2-A person who is well informed about
the group’s task and/or highly motivated as a group
member may emerge as a leader and set into motion
internal decision-making processes, such as recruit-
ing new members or assigning group roles, that affect
the structure of a group. Different members will also
gravitate toward different roles within the group and
will advocate for certain procedures and courses of
action over others. External factors such as group
size, task, and resources also affect group structure.

(d): The options seem to be very close ones so that we
need to get some idea about all of them.

‘A. Creation of passive longing for media prod-
ucts—It has the word ‘passive’, otherwise we see

21

2.13

the media and audience and products for audi-
ence as dynamic and active.

B. Omnivorous devouring of media content -—
Here, omnivorous means to consume all kinds
of food and devouring means consuming them.
Omnivorous devouring means that all types of
media content is being taken in, but media has to
show the contents to the audience or public also,
so that it is appreciated (or depreciated).

C. Compensation through identification—-Here,
identification means connectivity with the audi-
ence or public so that some kind of rewards
(through advertisements) can be generated.
That is basically being done by YouTube, Face-
book, Instagram, etc. They develop loyalty and
CRM (Customer Relationship Management).

D. Vicarious Wish Fulfilment—Vicarious méans a
feeling developed or experienced by watching or
reading about somebody else doing something,
rather than by doing it yourself. An example of
vicarious is when a mother who always wanted
to be a dancer continually pushes her children to
do ballet.

Freud’s most well-known theory, wish fulfilment, is
the idea that when wishes can’t or won’t be fulfilled in
our waking lives, they are carried out in dreams. Even
anxious or punishing dreams have their roots in wish
fulfilment. Freud’s dream theory is rooted in the idea
that we all need a way to express or vicariously fulfil
all of our wishes and desires.

Now, we see that people are led by their dreams and
fantasies. The social media generates the need for
product which were not felt by public till they see
them on social media.

Sources of suggestion for appropriate roles—this point
is vey important. Even the children of today want to
empathize the roles of adult members. This role per-
ception means that they are becoming more assertive
and challenging. They have almost complete access to
media that enables them to challenge the roles being
played by elders.

Accordingly

Thus, (a) is the correct answer.

(a): That means that there are 15 students with below
ranks in the class and Aashman is 16th student from
bottom. Considering his position in the class, there are
(43 - 16), that is 27 students above him in the class.
Thus, his own position is 28th in the class.

(d): ATQ, Cost Price of 40 Pens = Marked Price of 36
Pens

Let the Cost Price of 40 Pens = Marked Price of 36
Pens = Rs 36

Taking them separately,

Cost Price of 40 Pens = Rs 36

Marked price of 36 pens = Rs 36

Marked Price of 40 Pens = Rs 40

Discount is 1% on Marked Price.

Discount = 1% of Rs 40 = 40 paise

Selling Price = Rs 40 — 40 Paise = Rs 39.60
Thus Profit = Rs 39.60 — Rs 36 = Rs 3.60
Profit Percentage = 3.60 / 36 x 100 = 10%

(b): As we know, a categorical statement lines up
two distinct categories or classes against one another,
measuring degrees of comparison, and makes an
assertion about the categories. This always involves a
subject term and a predicate term:

27.

E Universal i A AMS2 : All Birds :
‘Affirmative Mammals”
Universal E NoSareP No Birds are
Negative Mammals
‘Particular 1 SomeSareP SomeBirdsare _
‘Affirmative == = Mammals
Particular O Some Sare Some Birds are
Negative not P Not Mammals

We need to look at traditional square of opposition
and the Truth Table.
T ——___—_—_» F

AE F F
Sub Sub
alternation alternation
oO DF

Sub-Contrary
T ——_______» D
F ———____—__» T

We need to look for separate discussion of contradic-
tories, contraries, sub contraries and sub alternation
for questions linked with square of opposition.

Now look at the question statement - ‘No Birds
are Mammals’ is Universal Negative that is E.
As it is given to be true, come to the second row where

A is False~it means that All Birds are Mammals is
False.

I is False—it means that Some Birds are Mammals is
False

O is True—Some Birds are Not Mammals is True

Thus, as per question A, B and D are part of answer.
Thus, option B is the correct answer.

(a): Ad Populum: This can also be termed as ‘Appeal
to Popularity’. This argument supports a position by
appealing to the shared opinion of a large group of
people such as the majority, the general public.

In this statement, a housemaker, XYZ Home Finance

the need to have your own sweet home — most likely

by financing through maximum finance, compara-
tively less rate of interest, long duration and easy to
pay system of Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs).

(d): Statement I-‘Some S is P’ belongs to ‘I-category’
AND ‘Some S is not P’ belongs to ‘O-category’. That
has been explained in the explanation given under
question 26.

By looking at first diagram in question 26, we can say
that I and O are sub-contrary to each other, they are
not contrary to each other. So, Statement I is a false
statement.

Statement II-Again, ‘Some S is/are not P’ is a ‘O-cat-
egory’ statement and ‘All S is P’ is a ‘A-category’
statement. As given in square of opposition diagram,
both O and A are contradictory to each other. Thus,
Statement II is a true statement.

Thus, (d) is the correct answer.

(a): Statement I-The anumana is basically about
attaining inferential knowledge. That is further linked
with invariable concomitance or vyapti. Thus, the anu-
mana is based on syllogistic inference that is basically
invariable concomitance (vyapti) between middle
term and major term. Concomitance means the fact of
existing or occurring together with something else.

Thus, we are basically concerned with the definition
of Vyapti that is the non-presence of middle term
(hetu) in the locus of the non-existence of the major
term (sadhya). Vyapti is an invariable and uncon-
ditional relation between the middle term and the
major term.

For example, the hill is full of fire because it is full
of smoke. Here, smoke which is the middle term is
absent from all regions outside the region of fire (the
major term).

Statement II-Vyapti may also be defined as the co-
presence of the middle term with the major term
when there is no condition attached to the middle
term. Vyapti is the possession of that nature which
establishes the connection of the middle term with
the major term.

We can show the relation between minor term
(paksh), middle term (hetu) and major term (sad-
hya) with the help of following diagram.

(c): Anumana is knowledge that is obtained after
a proof. Anumana is not a direct knowledge but it

is obtained after some perception, testimony, etc.
According to question, we can discuss the following
three aspects.

1. Purvavat-This is basically cause to. effect rela-
tionship. This can also be termed as unperceived
effect from a perceived cause, thus the perceived
cause comes first and thereafter, the unperceived
effect (anuman). For example, we can infer the
future rain from a present dark clouds.

2. Sesavat—An inference in which the unperceived
cause is known from a perceived effect. For
example, we come to know about the rain from a
muddy flow of water in the river.

3. Samanyatodrasta Anumana-There are many
universal positions in this world such as different
positions of moon around the earth. From these,
we can draw inferences.

31. (a): MODEM functions as both - input and output

device. MODEM isacontraction oftwowords-MOdulator

/ DEModulator which functions simultaneously.

1. When sending communications out of the net-
work, the modem converts (modulates) a digital
signal into an analog signal for transmission over
analog media such as cable or telephone line.

2. When signals are coming into the modem from
the internet, it converts (demodulates) the analog
signal back to a digital signal for transmission. on
the local network.

32. (a):

A. Trojan Horse-This is a type of malware that dis-
guises itself as legitimate code or software. Once
they get inside the network, these attackers are
able to carry out any action that a legitimate user
could perform, such as exporting files, modify-
ing data, deleting files or otherwise altering the
contents of the device.

B. Virus-A computer virus is a type of computer
program that, when executed, replicates itself by
modifying other computer programs and insert-
ing its own code. If this replication succeeds, the
affected areas are then said to be “infected” with a
computer virus, a metaphor derived from biologi-
cal viruses.

C. Web bug-This is also known as a Web beacon, is
a file object that is placed on a Web page or in an
e-mail message to monitor user behaviour.

D. Zombies-This is actually a computer connected
to the Internet that has been compromised by a
hacker via a computer virus, computer worm, or
trojan horse program and can be used to perform
malicious tasks under the remote direction of the
hacker.

33. (d): B, C, Ais the correct answer.

Random Access Memory (RAM) - This is essentially
a short term memory where data is stored as the pro-
cessor needs it.

Anti-static Strap — This is a key piece of safety gear
that helps to prevent the build up of static electricity
near sensitive electronics or other projects where static
charge could damage electronics or cause safety issues.

34. (b): Statement 1-Let’s look at some basics which

have been offered officially.

SWAYAM is basically Study Webs of Active-Learn-
ing for Young Aspiring Minds that is part of MOOC
Platform. It was developed indigenously by AICTE
in 2016 to facilitate hosting of online courses which
_ could be accessed by anyone, anywhere at any time
” free of cost. The main objective is to achieve access,
equity and quality in context of education. This covers
subjects from high school onwards till higher educa-
tion including Skill based courses to ensure that every
student benefits from learning material through ICT.

The courses hosted on SWAYAM are in 4 quadrants
— video lectures, specially prepared reading material
that can be downloaded/printed, self-assessment
tests through tests and quizzes and an online discus-
sion forum for clearing the doubts. The objective is to
make system inclusive by using audio-video, multi-
media and state of the art pedagogy/ technology.

Statement 2—DigiLocker is basically linked with good
governance. This Indian digitization online service is
provided by Ministry of Electronics and Information
Technology (MeitY) under Digital India initiative.
This intends to provide services to every Aadhaar
holder for accessing driving license, vehicle registra-
tion, academic mark sheet in digital format from the
original issuers of these certificates. It also provides
1GB storage space for the same.

The structure of DigiLocker includes My Certificates
(digital and uploaded documents), My Profile, My
Issuer, My Requester and Directories.

A. Spyware — This malicious software enters our
computer device, gathers data, and forwards it to
a third-party without our-consent. This legitimate
software monitors our data for commercial pur-
poses like advertising.

B. Firewall —A Firewall in a computer system is basi-
cally a network security system which controls
the flow of data between two or more networks,
and manages the links between the networks. A
firewall can consist of both hardware and soft-
ware elements. The examples are router (physical
firewall), anti virus, Java (software firewall).

C. Bluetooth — This is a short-range wireless tech.

36. (b): Asbestos was nicknamed “the magic minera]”

as it has unique chemical and physical properties.
The asbestos is used in thousands of products and
industries such as roofing, thermal and electrica]
insulation, cement pipe and sheets, flooring, plas-
tics, textiles, paper, etc. Tiny asbestos fibres collect
in the lungs. Asbestos causes mesothelioma, that is
a relatively rare cancer of the thin membranes that
line the chest and abdomen. It causes cancers of the
lung, larynx and ovary. Mesothelioma treatments
include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.

Asbestosis causes permanent lung damage. In Pleu-
ral effusions, fluid collects around the lungs.

Asbestos deposits are found in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar,
Jharkhand, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Manipur.

37. (a): The occurrence of cyclones is a sea linked phe-

nomena so there are no chances of its origin from
Northern and Central India. It originates in the seas
due to low air pressure conditions. The East coast
receives cyclones not only from those that originated
in Andaman Sea but also from the Pacific Ocean
(typhoons). For transfer of typhoons, there is no big

land mass to stop this. The Bay of Bengal receives -

more rainfall in comparison to west coast. The winds
are slower and weaker over the ocean. This part is also
fed by rivers Ganga and Brahmaputra.

The surface sea temperature and humidity also play
an important part. The average temperature is around
28°C that is intensified by warm air currents.

Odisha state suffers the most from cyclones. The ratio
between cyclones from east coasts and west coasts is
4:1.

The tropical cyclones are less in west coast due to dry
air intrusion as dry winds flow from west to east. The
Arabian Peninsula is already dry. There is a strong
wind shear which hampers cyclone development. |

The naming of cyclones is done in a schematic manner
by World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) that
was set up in the year 1950, the roots of which were
planted at the 1873 Vienna International Meteorolog-
ical Congress. WMO maintains rotating lists of names
which are appropriate for each Tropical Cyclone
basin. If a cyclone is particularly deadly or costly, then
its name is retired and replaced by another one.

38. (b):

A. Greater biodiversity in ecosystems, species, and
individuals leads to greater stability. For exam-
ple, species with high genetic diversity and many
populations that are adapted to a wide variety
of conditions are more likely to be able to with-

‘ stand weather disturbances, disease, and climate
change. In other words, the two key compo-
nents of ecosystem stability are resilience and
resistance. Resistance is an ecosystem’s ability
to remain stable when confronted with a distur-
bance. Resilience is the speed at which an ecosys-
tem recovers from a disturbance.

B. Extinction is the death of all members of a species
of plants, animals, or other organisms. The three
types of extinction are mass extinction, back-
ground extinction, and human led extinction.
Earth could lose 16% of its species if the average
global temperature rise exceeds 4.3 °C.

Human activities in the form of anthropogenic
activities are basically human interference. The
main modern causes of extinction are the urban-
isation, industrialisation, loss and degradation
of habitat (mainly deforestation), over exploita-
tion (hunting, overfishing), invasive species, cli-
mate change, and nitrogen pollution. Our global
food system is the primary driver of biodiversity
loss, with agriculture alone being the identified
threat to 24,000 of the 28,000 (86%) species at
risk of extinction.

C. Habitat fragmentation actually leads to with-
drawal of support systems to many other species
which put their survival at stake.

Invertebrates are central to the functioning of ecosys-
tems, and are important part of biodiversity, yet they
are underappreciated and understudied. The Red List

39.

of Threatened Species of the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an important ref-
erence for the threat of species, but it is still heavily
biased towards vertebrates, with invertebrates being
particularly underrepresented.

(d): Landfills—Landfill gases produced during bio-
logical degradation of buried organic wastes include
methane, which when released to the atmosphere,
can contribute to global climate change. This can be
taken as a part of manure management.

Methane is the second-most abundant greenhouse
gas in the atmosphere, after carbon dioxide.

According to the IPCC, more than 40 per cent of meth-
ane emissions come from farms or are an outcome of
peatland destruction. A quarter of the global emissions
are products of agriculture and land-use changes. The
pledge by more than 80 nations, helped by the US and
EU, to cut emissions of this GHG (greenhouse gas) by
30 per cent is, therefore, an important step in global
warming mitigation efforts. Methane is 80 times
more powerful than carbon dioxide in its first 20
years in the atmosphere. While much of the conten-
tious aspects of curbing emissions of this GHG pertain
to agriculture, the oil and gas industry — especially
natural gas, whose popularity as a relatively cleaner
fossil fuel has led to a 50 per cent increase in its use in
the past 10 years — is the second-highest emitter of
this gas.

Global Methane Pledge—During Glasgow COP meet-
ing, US and EU floated the idea of Global Methane
Pledge so as to contribute towards global tempera-
ture rise limit to 1.5°C. Participants joining the Pledge
agree to take voluntary actions to contribute to a col-
lective effort to reduce global methane emissions
at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, which
could eliminate over 0.2°C warming by 2050. This is
a global pledge, and not a national reduction target.
Russia, India and China have not signed the Global
Methane Pledge.

A. Emission Trading — Kyoto Protocol— This proto-
col was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December
1997 and entered into force on 16 February
2005. The main objective of Kyoto Protocol was
to reduce the emission of gases. This was put into
practice by committing industrialized countries
and economies in transition to limit and reduce
greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The follow-
ing were the key objectives of Kyoto Protocol.

1. International Emissions Trading ;
2. Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
3. Joint implementation (JD

There were annexed nations for the purpose of
reduction of gases. The key concept was ‘com-
mon but differentiated responsibilities’ (CBDR).

The main GHGs were Carbon dioxide (CO,),
Methane (CH,), Nitrous oxide (N,0), Hydro-
fluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbons (PFCs);
and Sulphur hexafluoride (SF,).

B. Sustainable Management of Resources ~ Rio
Summit (1992) - Agenda 21 of Rio Summit
(1992). talked about it. The ‘Earth Summit’ con-
cluded that the concept of sustainable develop-
ment was an attainable goal for all the people of
the world, regardless of whether they were at the
local, national, regional or international level. It
also recognized that integrating and balancing
economic, social and environmental concerns in
meeting our needs is vital for sustaining human
life on the planet and that such an integrated
approach is possible.

Cc. Clean Affordable Energy — International Solar
Alliance (ISA) — ISA is a treaty based inter-gov-
_ernmental organization working to create a global
market system to tap the benefits of solar power
and promote clean energy applications. This was
primarily promoted by India and France. it was
started in 30 November 2015.

D. Intended Nationally Determined Contributions
~ Paris Agreement — This agreement was adopted
in 2015. They are essence of the Paris Agreement
so that they can facilitate the achievement of
long-term objectives of emission reduction, bet-
ter energy measures, forest resources, etc. INDCs
embody efforts by each country to reduce national

emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate

change.

The long term objective is to hold the increase in
global average temperature to well below 2°C, to
pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C, and to
achieve net zero emissions in the second half of this
century. We can get the basic idea of revised goals by

(b): On this day in 1835, Thomas Babington Macaulay
successfully westernised education in India; English
was made the official language for the government
and courts, and was adopted as the official medium
of instruction. This point is specifically important in
Macaulay Minutes - ‘We must at present do our best
to form a class of persons, Indian in blood and col-
our, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in
intellect’.

(a): Nalanda University is the correct answer. Nal- -
anda is an ancient center of higher learning in Bihar
from 427 to 1197. Nalanda was established in the 5th
century AD in Bihar, India.

A new Nalanda University has been recently devel-
oped in Bihar in 2010.

Xuan Zang (or call him Hiuen Tsang) visited Nalanda
University in 7th century. He stayed and travelled in
India for sixteen years. He translated Buddhist scrip-
tures. He also studied logic, Sanskrit grammar, Yogac-
ara in India. He opposed Samkhya and Vaiseshika
that he found to be opposing Budhhist philosophy.

According to I-Quing, there were followers of both
“vehicles” - Hinayana and Mahayana. Northern India
and most of the islands of the South Seas (such as
Sumatra, Java — parts of present Indonesia) practiced
Hinayana. The Buddhists in China and Malayu prac-

ticed Mahayana.

1. For future questions, note that Fa-Hien was the
first Chinese traveller to visit India in the early
fifth century. The purpose of his visit was to look
for texts sacred to Buddhism.

2. Taxila university was one of the oldest universi-
ties of the world.

3. Nalanda University is a public central/union uni-
versity located in Rajgir in Nalanda district in the
state of Bihar. It is designated as an Institute of
National Importance (INI) and excellence. This
international university is supported by 18 mem-
ber countries was established by an Act of the
Indian Parliament in 2010. The President of India
serves as the Visitor to Nalanda University.

(a): National Knowledge Commission (NKC) was con-
structed in 2006 as a high-level advisory body to the
Prime Minister of India, with the objective of trans-
forming India into a knowledge society. It was brain
child of Sam Pitroda. NKC-submitted around 300
recommendations on 27 focus areas. NKC focused
on five key areas of the knowledge paradigm — access
to knowledge, knowledge concepts, knowledge crea-
tion, knowledge application and development of bet-

ter knowledge services.

NKC has recommended setting up of a National Sci-
ence and Social Science Foundation (NSSF) for pro-
ducing research work that can fetch a Nobel Prize for
an Indian scientist.

.(c): National Education Policy, 2020 envisages the
setting up of an autonomous body — National Edu-
cational Technology Forum (NETF) to provide a
platform for free exchange of ideas on the use of tech-
nology to enhance learning, assessment, planning,
administration and so on, both for School and Higher
Education.

Aim of NETF: The aim of the NETF will be to facili-
tate decision making on the induction, deployment
and use of technology by providing to the leadership
of education institutions, State and Central Govern-
ments and other stakeholders the latest knowledge
and research as well as the opportunity to consult and
share best practices. The NETF will have following
functions:

1, To provide independent evidence-based advice to
Central and State Government agencies on tech-
nology-based interventions.

2. To build intellectual and institutional capacities
in education technology. ,

3. To envision strategic thrust areas in this domain.

4. To articulate new directions for research and
innovation.

5. To lay down standards of content, technology,
and pedagogy for online/digital teaching-learn-
ing. These standards will help to formulate guide-
lines for e-learning by States, Boards, Schools,
HEIs, etc.

6. To maintain regular flow of authentic data from
multiple sources including educational technol-
ogy innovators and will engage with diverse set
of researchers to analyse the data.

7. To conduct multiple regional and national con-
ferences, workshops, etc. to solicit inputs from
national and international educational technol-
ogy researchers, entrepreneurs, and practitioners.

8. To identify technological interventions for the
purpose of improving teaching-learning and eval-
uation process, supporting teacher preparation
and professional development, enhancing educa-
tional access, and streamlining educational plan-
ning, management, and administration including
process related to admissions, attendance, assess-
ments, etc.

9. To categorize emergent technologies based on
their potential and estimated frame for disrup-
tion, and periodically present this analysis to
Ministry of Education.

In July, 2021, the Prime Minister stated that
National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR)
and National Education Technology Forum
(NETF) would be working to make digital and
economic framework across the country.

Let us look at the few other initiatives started by
Government of India in education sector.
Academic Bank of Credit: This aims to pro-
vide multiple entry and exit options for stu-
dents in Higher education and also the first year
Engineering Programmes in Regional Languages
and Guidelines for Internationalization of Higher
Education.

Vidya Pravesh: The initiative is a three-month
play-based school preparation module for Grade
1 students.

Indian Sign Language: The Indian Sign

Language has been launched as a subject at the ©

secondary level.

NISHTHA 2.0: This is an integrated programme
of teacher training designed by NCERT.

SAFAL (Structured Assessment For Analyzing
Learning Levels): SAFAL is a competency-based
assessment framework, which has been launched
for Grades 3, 5 and 8 in CBSE schools.

Artificial Intelligence Website: A website dedi-
cated to Artificial Intelligence has also been
launched.

45. (b): Curriculum revision means to modify the existing
curriculum using data from the review. Review and
revision are important because they enable teachers
to consider the ways curriculum interacts with actual
students in a real teaching learning environment. The
vision and mission also undergo a change. The social,
political, economic and above all the philosophical
environment are always at a change so as to make
teaching learning process more effective. Thus, there
are different stakeholders. The demands of industry
also change, so that the curriculum produces more
outcome-based citizens.

Read the given passage and answer the questions
that follow:

Marie Curie was a Polish-born physicist and chem-
ist and one of the most famous scientists of her time.

Together with her husband, Pierre, she discovered
radium, an element widely used for treating can.
cer, and studied uranium and other radioactive
substances. Pierre and Marie’s amicable collabora.
- tion later helped to unlock the secrets of the atom,
Together with her husband Pierre, she was awarded
the Noble Prize for Physics in 1903.

Marie was born in Warsaw, Poland on 7 November
1867, the daughter of a Physics teacher. At an early
age, she displayed a brilliant mind and a blithe per-
sonality. Her great exuberance for learning prompted
her to continue with her studies after high school. She
became disgruntled, however, when she learned that
the university in Warsaw was closed to women. Deter-
mined to receive a higher education, she defiantly left
Poland and in 1891 entered the Sorbonne, a French
University, where she earned her master’s degree and
doctorate in Physics.

Marie was fortunate to have studied at the Sorbonne
with some of the greatest scientists of her day, one of
whom was Pierre Curie. Marie and Pierre were mar-
ried in 1895 and spent many productive years work-
ing together in the physics laboratory. A short time
after they discovered radium, Pierre was killed by a
horse-drawn wagon in 1906. Marie was stunned by
the horrible misfortune and endured heartbreaking
anguish. Despondently she recalled their close rela-
tionship and the joy that they had shared in scientific
research. The fact that that she had two young daugh-
ters to raise by herself greatly increased her distress.

Curie’s feeling of desolation finally began to fade when
she was asked to succeed her husband as a Physics
professor at the Sorbonne. She was the first woman to
be given a professorship at the world-famous univer-
sity. She received her second Noble Prize in Chemistry
for isolating radium, in 1911. Curie’s eldest daughter,
Irene, was herself a scientist and winner of the Noble
Prize for Chemistry.

Although Marie Curie eventually suffered a fatal ill-
ness from her long term exposure to radium, she
never became disillusioned about her work. Regard-
less of the consequences, she had dedicated herself to
science and to revealing the mysteries of the physical
world.
46, At what age did Marie Curie receive her first Nobel
prize?
(a) 36 years
(b) 56 years
47. After how many years of her marriage did Marie Curie
lose her husband?
(a) 11 years
(c) 28 years

(c) 44 years

(b) 39 years

HINTS AND SOLUTIONS

1. (c): The percentage of children who were not over-
weight in 2016 = 100-30 = 70%
Their number = 70/100 x 7500 = 5250
The percentage of children who were not overweight
in 2017 = 100-28 = 72%
Their number = 72/100 x 10500 = 7560
The total number = 5250 + 7560 = 12810
Thus, (c) is the correct answer.
2. (d): For the year 2019

Number of overweight men = 16% of 33000
16/100 x 33000 = 5280

Number of overweight women = 30% of 27000
30/100 x 27000 = 8100

Number of overweight children = 30% of 8000
30/100 x 8000 = 2400

The total of above three = 5280 + 8100 + 2400
15780

Their average = 15780 / 3 = 5260
Thus (d) is the right answer.

3. (b): If we assume that total number of men in 2021
was 100

Then the number of overweight men = 37.5

The number of not overweight men = 100 - 37.5 =
62.5

The required percentage = 37.5 / 62.5 x 100=3/5
xX 100 = 60%

Thus, (b) is the correct answer

4. (a): For the year 2018

The number of overweight women = 25% of 30000 =
25/100 x 30000 = 7500

The number of overweight children = 35% of 6000 =
35/100 x 6000 = 2100

The total of overweight men and women = 7500 +
2100 = 9600

The number of overweight men = 30% of 31500 =
30/100 x 31500 = 9450

The required difference = 9600 - 9450 = 150

lI

5. (d): The required ratio between overweight women
in 2018 and number of overweight men in 2020

= 25% of 30000 : 12% of 35000
= 750: 420

=25:14

Thus, (d) is the correct answer.

6. (b): Central Processing Unit (CPU): This part of a.

_ computer is comprised with digital circuits called
arithmetic logic units (ALU) that are capable of per-
forming billions of arithmetic and logic operations
every second.

ALU is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and
logic operations. This makes the fundamental build-
ing block of the CPU of a system. The modern CPUs
contain powerful and complex ALUs.

Control Unit (CU) - Modern CPUs contain a CU, in
addition to ALUs. CU tells the ALU what operation is
to be performed on the data. ALU stores the result in
an output register. CU moves the data between these
registers, the ALU, and memory.

Process Registers — ALUs load data from input regis-
ters. A register is a small amount of storage available
as part of a CPU.

The information in a computer is stored and manipu-
lated in the form of binary numbers, i.e. 0 and 1 which
are managed by Transistor switches which are open or
closed.

CPU. Black lines indicate data flow, whereas red lines
indicate control flow. Arrows indicate the direction of
flow.

7. (c): Bioaccumulation describes the accumulation and
enrichment of contaminants in organisms, relative to
that in the environment. Bioaccumulation is the net
result of all uptake and loss processes. Uptakes are

. respiratory and dietary. Loss happens by egestion,
passive diffusion, metabolism, transfer to offspring
and growth.

8. (b): ‘Leaves are Green’ and ‘Green is Good’ are coded
by 467 and 485, respectively. The word Green is there
in both sentences and so is 4. Thus, ‘Green’ is indi-

cated by 4........... (1)

Similarly, in ‘Leaves are Green’ and ‘They are play-
ing’, coded by 467 and 639 respectively, the word
‘are’ is common. Their codes also have 6 in com-

Comparing (1) and (2) and Leaves are Green with
each other, we can say that leaves are indicated by 7.

Thus, (b) is the right answer.

. (d): There are different phases of human learning:

1. Cognitive - knowing, or head
2. Affective - emotions, feelings, or heart and

3. Psychomotor - doing, or kinesthetic, tactile, hap-
tic or hand/body

Bloom’s Cognitive Taxonomy in 1956 had remained
an essential element in teacher training. The updated
version was done by Anderson and Krathwohl in
2001. Affective skills were added in 1961 by David
Krathwohl.

Apply - Executing, Implementing

Analyze - Differentiating, Organizing, Attributing

. (c): Inaspreadsheet application, whenever a cell with

a formula is copied over to another cell, any cell refer-
ences in the formula will shift as per the relative shift
in the references of the copied cell and its destination.

The above behaviour can be explicitly disabled by
using the ‘$’ character before the column letter or row
number or both in the cell references in a formula.
We can take a look at what happens to the formula in
cells C3 and D2, when they are copied over from C2.

Example 1 - C2 contain the formula ‘= A2 + B2’

1. C3 will get the formula ‘= A3 + B3’
2. D2 will get the formula ‘= B2 + C2’

Example 2 - C2 contain the formula ‘= $A2 + B$2’
1. C3 will get the formula ‘= $A3 + B$2’
2. D2 will get the formula ‘= $A2 + C$2’

In the above example, the column A in the first refer-
ence and row number 2 in the second reference were
made absolute using the ‘$’ sign in the original for-
mula of cell C2. Thus, when C2 was copied over to
C3 and D2, the absolute part of both cell references
didn’t change in the formula.

In the given question, the value of the formula in cell
C4 is ‘= $A$3 + B2’. When this formula is copied over
to the cell C5, its value would become ‘= $A$3 + B3’,
as per the behaviour laid out above. Thus, value of C5
comes out to be 7.

11. (d): Learning allows us to make sense of the world

12.

13.

around us, the world inside of us, and where we fit
within the world. The life and society have become
very complex, the situations are diverse, we have to
deal with new situations every time. Thus, engage-

‘ment of students in different activities is very

important so that there is wholesome development
of personality. Education helps us get exposure to
new ideas and concepts.
(b):
A. Emphasize your interpretation approach indi-
cates that we may be highly subjective. It is not
relevant as we have to deal with open and diverse
society. The globalization has happened all
around. This type of approach also indicates the
feeling of ‘ethnocentrism’.

B. Forgetting your own culture means that we as a
culture are not participating so that establishing
contact with others may not be fruitful.

C. An ecosystem of mutual respect creates the feel-
ing of trust so that one culture can communicate
better with other cultures.

D. Knowing the cultural context of other people pro-
motes the feeling of ‘cultural relativism’, so that
we emphasize that every culture is equally impor-
tant. This helps in better communication with
other cultures.

E. Stating facts means that we believe in transpar-
ency and trustworthiness. We are not hiding
anything.

Thus, (b) is the correct answer.

(c): Ignoratio elenchi, is also called as ‘ignorance
of the refutation’. Refute means overthrow by argu-
ment, evidence, or prove to be false or incorrect or
controvert. It is broadly defined as any incorrect



=== Page 24 ===

argument which reaches an evidentially irrelevant
conclusion. Historically, the fallacy is also more
NARROWLY defined as a counterargument to an
argument which does not attempt to prove the con-
tradictory of what was intended to be proved.

In this statement, hunger of knowledge and hunger
of food are narrowly linked, without any substantial
value. Practically, it functions as a ‘catch-all’ category.
The Traditional Form of Ignoratio Elenchi (fallacy of

irrelevancy) is occurring here whenever the conclu-_

sion of an argument is irrelevant to its premises. The
fallacy of non sequitur is often identified with this
version.

14. (a): Both statements are true.

Statement 1 - Here, we can speak about three mod-
els of communication — linear, transactional and
interactive.

The linear model is transmission of communication -
mostly one way communication. So, called as trans-
mission model of communication.

Transactional Model takes into account social and
relational aspects and thus social context.

Interactive Models talk about channel (the way mes-
sages are sent and received), field of experience, phys-
ical context and psychological context. We can take
the examples of social media, interactive and online
marketing, user generated contents, chat rooms etc.
for interactive communication. We always look for
immediate feedback. Here, the communication is
a process where participants alternate positions as
sender and receiver and generate meaning by send-
ing messages and receiving feedback within physical
and psychological contexts.

1. The continuous feedback is the main element in
interactive communication. We are quickly able
to understand if a message is received or under-
stood. WhatsApp may be taken as an example.

2. There are continuous updates and communica-
tion with audiences.

3. There is more transparency in our interactive
communication.

4. There are additional alignment opportunities.
That was it seems to be extrovert as well.

5. Wecan share information with large audiences.

For statement 2 - The interested candidates may look

for Bloom Taxonomy once again that comes for digital
iconic communication.

15. (c): Internal validity is concerned with correctly con-

cluding that an independent variable and not some
extraneous variable is responsible for a change in the
‘dependent variable.

External validity refers to the generalizability and
also to randomisation of the treatment/condition
outcomes.

A. Randomisation - We need unbiased and objec-

tive in our research, and randomisation helps in
that. In simple terms, randomization eliminates
predictability. It follows the theory of probability,
This removes the possibility of any kind of human
interruption by the researcher. Randomization
eliminates accidental bias, including selection
bias.

Assume that a teacher has to select 10 students
out of 100 for a research purpose, they can be
any ten. Everyone in the class stands 1/100
chance of selection which are equal for anyone.
This equal chance of being selected is called as
randomisation.

B. Generalisation — It means that results of a
research study are applicable to the outer world.
That is called as the external validity.

Cc. Maturation -— The processes within subjects act
as a function of the passage of time. This happens
when study is conducted on people which are
base of research findings. If that element changes
over a period of time, it threatens the internal
validity of the research.

D. History — This refers to any event other than
the ‘independent variable’. History--the specific
events which occur between the first and second
measurement.

E. Instrumentation - The reliability of the instru- —
ment used to gauge the dependent variable or
manipulate the independent variable may change
in the course of an experiment. Thus, internal
validity may be threatened.

Both A and B facilitate the objectivity, unbiasedness
and validity of research. The question is about the
threat to internal validity in research. In this case,
these factors also matter for future questions.

1. Testing - first test affecting the subsequent tests

2. Statistical regression - candidates with extreme
scores, for example, choosing the poorest or the
most intelligent students in the class

3. Experimental mortality - that is the loss of
subjects

4. Selection of subjects - the biases which may
result in selection of comparison groups.
Randomisation can help in minimisation of this
effect.

When the sample size is small, randomization may
lead to Simpson Paradox. Similarly, the students can
study John Henry effect for additional knowledge



=== Page 25 ===
that is not conducive to internal validity.

The NET aspirants may remember the following
aspects which apply on external validity for future
questions.

1. Reactive or interaction effect of testing —

2. Interaction effects of selection biases and the
experimental variable

3. Reactive effects of experimental arrangements

4. Multiple treatment interference

. (a): All these universities are actually ancient uni-
versities. India is one of the oldest civilizations in the
world. It was a centre for higher learning in ancient
times. India contributed greatly to the field of Math-
ematics, Astrology, Astronomy, and other sciences.
Vedic science was so advanced that it could be com-
pared with the present day’s scientific inventions.

Taxila university was one of the oldest universities of
the world but that was not completely centralized.
The government has tried to revive the concept of
Nalanda University in Bihar.

. (c): With video conferencing we can conduct meet-
ings in two or more locations by audio and video trans-
mission. VC specifically uses web cameras, display
devices, microphones (for voice communication),
high-speed Internet connectivity and personal com-
puters. With VC, those who participate in the meeting
can see, hear and speak to one another, regardless of
their geographical location. This is useful, can be used
both in home and business.

During recent times, the availability of cloud-based
services has facilitated the to — do video conferenc-
ing with minimal upfront investment. Now there is
advantage of rapidly emerging Artificial Intelligence
(Al) powered features to improve both the audio and
video performance.

. (b): Let the original number of students = X

Average age = Total age / Number of students

Total original age = 15X years

New total age = 15X +.5(12.5) = 15X + 62.5 years =
15X + 125/2

New number of students = X + 5

New average age = 15 years — 6 months = 14.5 years
= 29/2 years

New average age = 29/2 = (15X + 125/2) / (X + 5)
29/2 (X + 5) = 15K + 125/2

29X + 145 = 30X 4+ 125

X= 145-125 = 20

Thus, the original number of students was 20.
Thus (2) is the correct answer.

(c): Assertion (A): According to government sources,
courses offered through SWAYAM (Study Webs of
Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds) are fully
recognized and eligible for credit transfer as per the
UGC (Credit Framework for Online Learning Courses
through Study Webs of Active Learning for Young
Aspiring Minds) Regulations, 2021. These regula-
tions, now facilitate an institution to allow upto 40%
of the total courses being offered in a particular pro-
gramme in a semester, through the online learning
courses offered through the SWAYAM platform. The
credits/marks obtained by the candidate enrolled in
universities for SWAYAM Certificate will be counted in
the transcript of the candidate, only if the University
has adopted MOOCs (Massive Open Online Course)
offered on SWAYAM Platform for Credit Transfer as
per the UGC (Credit Framework for Online Learning
Courses through Study Webs of Active Learning for
Young Aspiring Minds) Regulations, 2021.

Reason (R): SWAYAM is a part of MOOC. SWAYAM is
India’s own MOOCs platform, which offers free online
courses on almost all the discipline to students/
learners. The objective is to ensure access to the best
teaching learning resources to all, including the most
disadvantaged. The courses delivered on SWAYAM
are expected to reduce the digital divide by providing
access to best content to all. These courses are devel-
oped by reputed teachers in the country and available
free of cost. By integrating SWAYAM MOOCs with
conventional education the learning outcomes of the
students are expected to improve in coming days.

(a): Statement 1 - The agenda of sustainable devel-
opment is being carried forward with the help of
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which aim
to bring peace and prosperity to all people by 2030.
They started in the year 2015. This Agenda is a plan of
action for people, planet and prosperity. It also seeks
to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom. Ear-
lier there were Millennium Development Goals which
were set for a period between 2000 to 2015.

There are the 17 SDGs which are an urgent call for
action by all countries - developed and developing.
In simple terms, sustainable development means
integrating the economic, social and environmental
objectives of society, in order to maximise human
well-being in the present, without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their needs.

Statement 2 - Anthropogenic model is the root cause
for taking sustainable development agenda more seri-
ously. Anthropogenic activities is the human interrup-
tion in nature for the sake of development to make the
human life comfortable but these activities bring mis-
ery also in the form of pollution, hazards etc. We need
to have a look at the following diagram.

(b): According to www.swayam.gov.in - SWAYAM
conducts programmes through a platform that facil-
itates hosting of all the courses, taught in the class-
rooms from Class 9 till post-graduation to be accessed
by anyone, anywhere at any time. All the courses are
interactive, prepared by the best teachers in the coun-
try and are available, free of cost to any learner. More
than 1,000 specially chosen faculty and teachers from
across the country have participated in preparing
these courses.

The courses hosted on SWAYAM are in 4 quadrants

1. video lecture

2. specially prepared reading material that can be
downloaded/printed

3. self-assessment tests through tests and quizzes
and

4. an online discussion forum for clearing the
doubts. Steps have been taken to enrich the learn-
ing experience by using audio-video and multi-
media and state of the art pedagogy / technology.

For future questions - In order to ensure that best
quality content is produced and delivered, nine
National Coordinators have been appointed. They are
the following

1. AICTE (Ail India Council for Technical Education)

for self-paced and international courses

* 2. NPTEL (National Programme on Technology
Enhanced Learning) for Engineering

23.

24.

3. UGC (University Grants Commission) for non
technical post-graduation education

4. CEC(Consortium for Educational Communication)
for under-graduate education

5. NCERT (National Council of Educational
Research and Training) for school education

6. NIOS (National Institute of Open Schooling) for
school education

7. IGNOU (Indira Gandhi National Open University)
for out-of-school students

8. IIMB (indian Institute of Management,
Bangalore) for management studies

9. NITTTR (National Institute of Technical Teachers

(b): The fallacy of false cause (non causa pro causa) ©
mislocates the cause of one phenomenon in another
that is only seemingly related. The example taken in
the question statement are very much natural. The
moon is able to shine during the night as it gets light
from sun that is reflected back.

(b):. Hermeneutics is the art of understanding and
interpretation of texts, specifically religious ones.
Hermeneutics is philosophical and theological in
nature. The history of hermeneutics stretches across
epochs, methods and all the disciplines in the human-
ities, social sciences, and even the natural sciences. It
can be identified with four major strands: conserva-
tive, critical, radical, and moderate.

Sociologyis linked with society, groups and social insti-
tutions. Anthropology is the study of human beings
in its entirety.-Economics deals with wealth related
issues in the form of micro and macro- economics.



=== Page 27 ===
25.

26.

(d): Anthropogenic means human interruption in
environment for the sake of development. It is basi-
cally based on environment possibilism so that
humans are to determine which way the environment
should go. Earlier there was concept of environmen-
tal determinism that said that ultimately the environ-
ment should decide its own way.

We need to look at all the events.

Cyclones —- They are linked with sea water tem-
perature and pressure conditions. The more about
cyclones has been discussed in the earlier paper. The
frequency of cyclones has increased during recent
decades.

Nuclear Disasters - In a major nuclear disaster, a
reactor core is damaged and significant amounts of
radioactive isotopes are released which may result
in loss of lakhs of lives. The major such examples are
Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and Fukushima nuclear
disaster in 2011. The largest nuclear power plant in
Europe, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, is
located in Ukraine, and has been a major flashpoint
for nuclear disaster.

Floods — The frequency of floods has increased during
the recenttimes as the natural way of water has been
disrupted due to concretization of natural resources
in the form of buildings, roads, factories etc. Defor-
estation has happened in a big way. There are more
and more flash floods which cause more destruction.
Voleanoes — They erupt from within the earth as per
the temperature and pressure conditions of the earth,
so anthropogenic activities do not play any role in it.
Forest Fires ~ That is basically burning of forest trees
on a massive scale.

(a): Let’s discuss the main aspects of communication
and feedback.

Communication is the main source of interaction
between people by which they-share their ideas,
and thoughts with each other. Communication is
important in every aspect of life. The communica-
tion can be verbal, nonverbal or through by the use

- of sign language or body language. Feedback can be

referred as ‘fed-back’. Feedback means that response
is generated.

Feedback can be in the form of non-verbal cues pro-
vided by the receiver. Thus, feedback fulfils the basic
objective of two-way communication. The importance
of feedback can be gauzed from the following facts.
1. The element of feedback should always be there
to make the communication effective.

Feedback is effective listening.

Feedback can motivate.

Feedback can improve performance.

Feedback is a tool for continued learning.

Vb wWN

27,

28.

The feedback can be of following types:

j. Negative feedback: It reflects about mistakes,
errors during the process of communication, the
areas which have not been understood properly
and improvements required. —

2. Positive feedback: There is proper understand-

. ing of the message conveyed by sender.

3. Negative feedforward: These are basically cor-
rective comments about future behaviour of the
work and communication.

4. Positive feedforward: These affirm about the
future events.

(b): The question papers are made with the perspec-
tive of evaluation and assessment of candidates.
Objectivity - This can be taken as the main element
of a good question paper. They should be constructed
for the sake of qualifying an exam or the ranking of
candidates.

Subjectivity - This means that question paper setter
may be biased so that a particular set of candidates
get benefited from this.

Reliability — This refers to the consistency of a meas-
ure (whether the results can be reproduced under the
same conditions).

Validition — This refers to the accuracy of a measure
(whether the results really do represent what they are
supposed to measure).

From a research perspective, objectivity, reliability
and validity are important characteristics.

(a): Material Fallacies

There are five characteristics of a valid middle term;

they are as following:

1. Paksadharmata - The must be present in the
minor term. For example, smoke must be present
in the hill.

2. Sapaksasattva - It must be present in all positive
instances in which the major terms are present.
For example, the smoke must be present in the
kitchen where fire exists.

3. Vipaksasattva - It must be absent in all nega-
tive instances in which the major terms is absent.
For example smoke must be absent in the lake in
which fire does not exist.

4. Abadhita - It must be non-incompatible with the
minor term. For example, it must not prove the
coolness of fire.

5. Aviruddha - It must be qualified by the absence
of counteracting reasons which lead to a contra-
dictory conclusion. For example, ‘the fact of being
caused’ should not be used to prove the ‘eternal-
ity’ of sound.

Whenever, one of these characteristics is violated, the
fallacies take its place. It also says that the validity of



=== Page 28 ===
an inference depends on the validity of hetu or rea-
son. It is because of this fact that Naiyayikas consider
fallacies of inference as fallacies of the reason (hetv-
abhasa). Fallacies of inference thus are all MATERIAL
fallacies.

Fallacies of reason are of five types — Asiddha, Savyab-
hichara, Satpratipaksha, Badhita and Virudha. They
have been discussed as the last topic in Unit 6 of Pear-
son book.

Material fallacies are also known as fallacies of
presumption, because the premises ‘presume’ too
much—they either covertly assume the conclusion or
avoid the issue in view.

Reason — The Nyaya system is formal and is deduc-
tive-inductive can be understood through the follow-
ing example

(For such fallacies, we can refer to the last topic of
discussion in Unit 6.)

. (d): This question is quite similar to question number
26 in the previously solved pervious year paper. This
is the basic information

All Birds are
Mammals |
No Birds are

Affirmat

Universal

Particular O Some S are Some Birds are
Negative not P Not Mammals

Now look at the question statement — ‘Some plants

are not carnivorous’, that is basically O — type. This is

given to be false.

A. ‘some plants are carnivorous’ denotes I-type -
given to be True in question.

B. ‘some plants are carnivorous’ again denotes I-
type — given to be False.

C. No plants are carnivorous E-type — given to be

False
D. All plants are carnivorous denotes A-type — given
to be True

If O-type is false, then looking horizontally, we can
say that
I-type is True — that denotes that option A is a part of
answer.

30

31

°

Similarly E as False, that is option C is a part of answer,
Aas True, that is option D is also part of answer.

That means that A, C and D are part of answer. Thus
overall, (d) is the answer.

(a): Statement I - Qualitative data is powerful as the
most of this is to be collected from human resources
whose behaviour is always complex and dynamic.
Even the social context is so dynamic and changeable.
The behavioural context may even change from one
point of time to another. Qualitative data is basically
non numeric, and it holds conceptual information.
We use their feedback or response to capture their
themes and patterns. The answering research ques-
tions is difficult. Thus, the whole scene is based on
sensitive social, historical and temporal (time based)
context.

Statement II - Obtaining right kind of information
in a set of complex situations through customer inter-
views, surveys, and feedback. Context sensitivity
takes the surroundings into consideration while plan-
ning for the research. It takes into account community
values and assets.

We can look at the following types of approaches to
deal with the qualitative data so that we get the right
kind of information. This may be useful for the future
questions.

1. Content analysis —- This element examines and
quantifies the presence of certain words, subjects,
and concepts in text, image, video, or audio mes-
sages. The method transforms qualitative input
into quantitative data to help you make reliable
conclusions. This can be used for quantitative
data as well.

2. Thematic analysis — This can only be applied to
qualitative data, and focuses on identifying pat-
terns and ‘themes’. This can be done with innova-
tive tools such as Dovetail and Thematic.

3. Narrative analysis - This method used to inter-
pret research participants’ stories—things like
testimonials, case studies, interviews, and other
text or visual data.

4. Grounded theory analysis — This is a method of
conducting qualitative research to develop theo-
ries by examining real-world data.

5. Discourse analysis — This is the act of research-
ing the underlying meaning of qualitative data. It
involves the observation of texts, audio, and vid-
eos to study the relationships between the infor-
mation and its context.

(c): Assertion — Cyclones cause an amazing rise in
the sea level. Cyclones are composite phenomena,
consisting of winds, multiple storm waves, storm

‘
i
i



=== Page 29 ===
32.

33.

34.

surges (which generally last from several hours up to
a day) and inland flooding generated by heavy rain-
fall. This inland flooding often causes more fatalities
than the wind. Cyclones generally cause massive
erosion or deposition — both long- and cross-shore.
The forestations and green belts such as mangroves
usually protect us from the damage.

Reason ~ There are four stages of a cyclone - Forma-
tive Stage, Immature Stage, Mature Stage and Decay-
ing Stage.

A landfall happens when the centre of the storm
moves across the coast. It often carries heavy winds,
lashing rains, increasing sea level that can pose threat
to people living in the neighbouring region.

Once a cyclone makes landfall, it gets separated from
its ocean energy sources. When tropical cyclones
reach a land surface, they begin to lose their energy
and die out. This is because they are no longer receiv-
ing heat energy and moisture from the ocean, which
is needed to drive them.

(a): The National Council for Technical Educa-
tion was enacted in 1993 and was set up in 1995.
According to Government sources - the main objec-
tive of the NCTE is to achieve planned and coordi-
nated development of the teacher education system
throughout the country, the regulation and proper
maintenance of Norms and Standards in the teacher
education system and for matters connected there-
with. It includes the whole gamut of teacher educa-
tion programmes including research and training of
persons for equipping them to teach at pre-primary,
primary, secondary and senior secondary stages in
schools, and non-formal education, part-time edu-
cation, adult education and distance (correspond-
ence) education courses.

(a): Earth is known as ‘Water Planet’, as our planet

has more water than land.

1. In reality, less than three percent of Earth’s water
is fresh water, and most of that three percent is
inaccessible.

2. Over 68 percent of the FRESH WATER on Earth is
found in ice and snow (including glaciers).

3. Almost 30 percent of FRESH WATER is found in
ground water.

3. Only about 0.3 percent of FRESH WATER is found
in the surface water of lakes, rivers, and swamps.

4. In totality, more than 99 percent of Earth’s water
is unusable by humans and many other living
things.

As the question is in the form of increasing quantity,

(a) is the correct answer.

(c): Historical research is basically a descriptive study,
which mostly is a qualitative study.

The problem identification is the first thing that
should be done in any research. So, this can be taken
as the rnain objective.

Analytical synthesis means first probing all the
aspects of research study and then integrating them
in a desirable manner.

Universal Generalisation is an act of reasoning that
involves drawing broad inferences from particular
observations. It is widely-acknowledged as a qual-
ity standard in quantitative research. The chances of
generalisation are limited in qualitative research.

35. (ce):

Energy is the golden thread that connects economic
growth, increased social equity, and environmental
sustainability that allows the world to thrive. The
indicator for Energy Intensity is in terms of total pri-
mary energy supply and GDP at PPP.

Under target number 7 of Sustainable Development

Goals, we need to double the global rate of improve-
ment in energy efficiency by the year 2030.

36. (d): Phenomenology - This is a qualitative research

approach that seeks to understand and describe the
universal essence of a phenomenon. The approach
investigates the everyday experiences: of human
beings while suspending the researchers’ precon-
ceived assumptions about the phenomenon.

Ethnography ~- In this. qualitative research, a
researcher or an ethnographer study a particular
social/cultural group with the aim to understand it
better. They actively participate in the group in order
to gain an insider’s perspective of the group. He may
try to get the equivalent experience that is similar to
the group members. There are experiences relating
to process, participation, data collection, interviews,
and the analysis of documents and artifacts.

Ethnomethodology — This is the study of how social
order is produced in and through processes of social
interaction. It generally seeks to provide an alterna-
tive to mainstream sociological approaches.

Symbolic interactionism — This counsels us that a
complex social situation like triangulated research
involves much more than simply forging a rational
design among fairly like-minded colleagues, since
participants must work hard to create a working,
shared understanding of their research.

37. (d): According to Government sources - DigiLocker

is a flagship initiative of Ministry of Electronics & IT
(MeitY) under Digital India programme. DigiLocker
aims at ‘Digital Empowerment of citizen by providing
access to authentic digital documents to citizen’s digi-
tal document wallet. The issued documents in Dig-

iLocker system are deemed to be at par with original
physical documents as per Rule 9A of the Information
Technology (Preservation and Retention of Informa-
tion by Intermediaries providing Digital Locker facili-
ties) Rules, 2016 notified on February 8, 2017 vide
G.S.R. 711(E).

Benefits to Citizens

j. Important Documents Anytime, Anywhere!

2. Authentic Documents, Legally at Par with
Originals.

3. Digital Document Exchange with the consent of
the citizen.

4. Faster service Delivery- Government Benefits,
Employment, Financial Inclusion, Education,
Health.

Benefits to Agencies

Reduced Administrative Overhead: Aimed at the
concept of paperless governance. It reduces the
administrative overhead by minimizing the use of
paper and curtailing the verification process.

Digital Transformation: Provides trusted issued doc-
uments. Issued Documents available via DigiLocker
are fetched in real-time directly from the issuing
agency.

Secure Document Gateway: Acts as a secure docu-
ment exchange platform like payment gateway
between trusted issuer and trusted Requester/Verifier
with the consent of the citizen. ,

Real Time Verification: Provides a verification mod-
ule enabling government agencies to verify data
directly from issuers after obtaining user consent.

. (a); We will use the formula: N3 + 1 where N is 1, 2,

3,4, ccececeee ees
BP+i=2
2?+2=10
3? + 3 = 30
43 + 4 = 68
5?+5 = 130
6? + 6 = 222
73 + 7 = 350

Thus, (a) is the correct answer.

(c): The natural ability to live or work together in

harmony because of well-matched characteristics is

called as compatibility between individuals.

(a) Stewardship is an ethical value that embodies
the responsible planning and management of
resources.

40.

41.

(b) Interest in media for two individuals may not
develop in compatibility. Between two individu-
als, one may be interested in football matches,
and other one in serials.

(c) Empathy is shown in how much compassion and
understanding we can give to another. Sympathy
is more of a feeling of pity for another. Empathy
is our ability to understand how someone feels
while sympathy is our relief in not having the
same problems. ,

(d) External influence may help in temporary asso-
ciation, and not in compatibility.
(b): Non Conventional Learning Programmes-

The education system in which teaching-learning
activities is offered other than the on-campus with
fixed time classrooms. For examples, evening learn-

ing, distance learning, vocational studies, skill-based —

courses, online learning, etc.

Non-conventional education is inspired by the P.H.
Coombs, and Ahmed who has worked on non-formal
education for the poor.

Characteristics of Non-conventional learning

e Learners oriented

¢ No fixed curriculum

* Cost-effective

e Linked to employment

e Continuous

e For improvement of Quality

Target groups of non-conventional education are
unemployed youths, the school dropped out, under-
privileged group, women and girls, Tribal and Minor-
ity population. This type of education is also for
literacy programmes.

(b): Let the number of birds on Tree A = A

And birds of Tree B = B

In first situation — if two birds shift from B to A, then
birds on A and B will be equal.

B-2=A+2

A-B=-4...... (1) .

In second situation — If 2 birds shift from A to B, then
birds on B will be double than those on A. Here, we

are doubling the birds on A so that both on A and B
are equal.

2(A-2) =B+2
2A-4=B+2
2A-B=2+4=6



=== Page 31 ===
Deducting 2 from 1

A-B-(2A-B) =-4-6

-1A = -10

A=10

Putting A = 10 in equation (1)

10-B = -4

-B = -4-10

B= 14

Now, A=10, B= 14, thus (b) is the answer.
The question can be solved directly from the answer
by adding and reducing the values.

2. (d): Grapevine communication is basically informal
in nature so that more and more people feel comforta-
ble in it. They get connected in it, they feel connected
to informal groups where they express themselves.
Thus, informal communication boosts the morale of
the employees.

In the grapevine, employees discuss various issues.
The anxieties of the employees are also expressed.

The formal communication moves in a set direction,
so employees are bound by rules and regulations.

3. (b): Basically, criterion of valid knowledge is called as
pramana. The inference of one proposition from two
premises is called as syllogism. Any error of reason-
ing is called as fallacy. In nyaya system, it is called as
hetvabhasa.

The aspects A and B have been discussed in an earlier

question.

C. hetu (causation) is missing, (it may seem more
like inductive).

D. Linga paramarsa: The Nyaya syllogism has five
terms. Among them, middle term works as a
bridge between the major and the minor terms.
Therefore, the middle term has main responsibil-
ity to prove a syllogism valid or invalid. How a
middle term is related to major term is lingapara-
marsha. There are five characteristics of a middle
term:

1. Paksadharmata - it must be present in the minor
term. For example, smoke must be present in the
hill.

2. Sapaksasattva - It must be present in all positive
instances in which the major terms are present.
For example, the smoke must be present in the
kitchen where fire exists.

3. Vipaksasattva - It must be absent in all negative

instances in which the major terms are absent.

For example smoke must be absent in the lake in

which fire does not exist.

2.35

4. Abadhita - It must be non-incompatible with the
minor term. For example, it must not prove the
coolness of fire.

5. Aviruddha - It must be qualified by the absence
of counteracting reasons which lead to a contra-
dictory conclusion. For example, ‘the fact of being
caused’ should not be used to prove the ‘eternal-
ity’ of sound.

The above five are linked with Hetvabhasa or types
of it. In Indian logic a fallacy is called hetvahasa. It
means that middle term appears to be a reason but is
not a valid reason. All fallacies are material fallacies.
We have mentioned the five characteristics of a valid
middle term. When these are violated, we have falla-
cies. Five kinds of fallacies are recognised.

1. Assiddha or sadhyasama - This is the fallacy of

unproved middle.
2. Savyabhicara - This is the fallacy of irregular
middle.

3. Satpratipaksa - Here the middle term is contra-
dicted by another middle term.

4. Badhita - It is the non-inferentially contradicted
middle.

5. Viruddha - It is the contradictory middle.

44. (ce): Malware is actually worrisome, it is any pro-
gram or file that is intentionally harmful to a com-
puter, network or server. Malware comes in so many
variants, there are numerous methods to infect
computer systems. The malware includes computer
viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware and
spyware.

45. (c):

A. Montessori Method: This was developed by
Dr. Maria Montessori (1907) is based on the
idea of self-education. The child does not sit still
and idle to the lessons taught by the teacher,
here, in this system, the child educates himself
or herself, but with the teacher as a guide. The
child uses hands-on materials and specially
prepared classrooms to develop both intellect
and character. This type of self-actualization of
students is called “normalization.” This classroom
system is suitable in theory for all ages but mostly
practiced by preschoolers and kindergartners.
There is respect for feelings of child, the way
he/she wants to educate matters.

B. Integral Education, as envisioned by the Mother
and Sri Aurobindo, regards the child as a grow-
ing soul and helps him to bring out all that is
best, most powerful, most innate and living in his
nature. It helps the child develop all facets of his



=== Page 32 ===
personality and awaken his latent possibilities so

that he acquires

—astrong, supple, healthy, beautiful body

—a sensitive, emotionally refined, energetic
personality

- a wide-ranging, lively intelligence and will

-—the subtler spiritual qualities that unify and
harmonise the being around the child’s inmost
Truth or Soul.

The focus and emphasis in Integral Education (IE)
is not just information and skills acquisition but
also self-development, triggered from within the
child and supported and nourished by teachers and

parents. Every experience becomes a learning tool for
the child in its growth. IE helps the child to integrate
with its true Self, its surroundings, its society, its
country and humanity; in other words, to become the
complete being, the integral being that the child is
meant to be.

Read the passage carefully and answer the questions
46-50:
Leadership studies are an emergent discipline, and the
concept of leadership will continue to change. Leadership
lore is defined as an influence relationship among lead-
ers and followers who want real change and outcomes
that reflect their shared purpose. Leadership involves
influence. It occurs among people; those people who
intentionally desire significant changes, and the changes
reflect purpose shared by the leaders and their followers.
Influence means that the relationship among people
is not passive; however, also part of this definition is that
influence is multidirectional. It does not use orders or
threats to make somebody do something. The basic cul-
tural values in America make it easiest to think of leader-
ship as something a leader does to a follower. However,
leadership has an effect in both directions. In most orga-
nizations, superiors influence subordinates, but subordi-
nates also influence superiors. The people involved in the
relationship want real and important changes- leadership

involves creating change, not maintaining what normally
happens. In addition, the changes sought are not dictated
by leaders, but reflect purposes that leaders and followers
share. Moreover, change is toward an outcome that the

_ leaders and follower both want; a desired future or shared

purpose that motivates them toward this more preferable
outcome. An important aspect of leadership is influencing
others to come together around a common vision. Thus,
leadership involves the influence of people to bring about
change toward a desirable future.

HINTS AND SOLUTIONS

Questions 1 to 5 are from Data Interpretation

1.

(a)
Exports by country S during 2017-2020 = 28 + 28 +
21 + 32 = 109

Exports by country T during 2017-2020 = 31 + 33 +
23 +28 = 115

Thus, required ratio of exports between S and T =
109/115

- (d)

As per question, the profit percentage increase by dif-
ferent countries between 2019 and 2020 is to be cal-
culated first.

For Country P

Profit in 2019 = 36-28 = 8

Profit in 2020 = 32-22 = 10

Percentage increase = (10-8) /8x100 =2/8x100
= 25%

For Country Q

Profit in 2019 = 37-29 = 8

Profit in 2020 = 34-26=8

Percentage increase = (8-8) /8x 100 = 0/8x 100
= 0%

For Country R

Profit in 2019 = 36-32 = 4

Profit in 2020 = 34-28 = 6

Percentage increase = (6-4) /4x 100 = 2/4x 100
= 50%

As per question, the profit percentage increase by dif-
ferent countries between 2019 and 2020

For Country S

Profit in 2019 = 21-16=5

Profit in 2020 = 32-23 =9

Percentage increase = (9-5) /5x 100 = 4/5x100
= 80%

For Country T

Profit in 2019 = 23-12 = 11

Profit in 2020 = 28-21 =7

Percentage increase = (7-11) /11x100 = Reduction
Thus, country S has shown the maximum increase in profit.

. (b)

As.every figure is to be divided by 5 (number of years)
to calculate average imports, we may get the answer

_ directly by total as well, and thus save time.

The total imports during different years are:
Imports during 2017 = 25 + 28 + 24 + 22+ 26 =

© 125

Imports during 2018 = 24+ 26+ 28+ 18+ 16=
112
Imports during 2019 = 28 + 29+ 324+ 164+12=
117
Imports during 2020 = 22 + 26+ 28+ 23+ 21=
120

Thus, the minimum average imports were in the year
2018. Thus, the answer is (b).

- (d)

As every figure is to be divided by 5 (number of years)
to calculate average exports, we may get the answer
directly by total as well, and thus save time.

The total exports during different years are:

Exports during 2017 = 30 + 26 + 32+ 28+ 31 =
147

Exports during 2018 = 32 + 31+ 25+ 28+ 33 =
149

Export during 2019 = 36+ 37 + 36+ 21+ 23=153
Export during 2020 = 32 + 34 + 34+ 32 + 28 = 160

The maximum average exports were in the year 2020.
Thus, the answer is (d}.

. (b)

The average exports by country P = 30 + 32 + 36 +
32 = 1830/4 = 32.5

The average imports by country P = 25 + 24 + 28 +
22 = 99/4 = 24.75

Difference = 32.5 — 24.75 = 7.75

. (b) ICT

ASCII Code:

Computers work in binary code. Information is coded
using Os and 1s. Each 0 or 1 is called a bit. In the early
years of computer development, different computer
companies applied the binary system in their own
way.

Eventually, a set of standards was developed. Com-
puter manufactures agreed to use one code called
the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information
Interchange). ASCII is an 8-bit code. That is, it uses
eight bits to represent a letter or a punctuation mark.
Eight bits are called a byte. A binary code with eight
digits, such as 1101 1101,, can be stored in one byte
of computer memory.

7. (b) Logical Reasoning
The knowledge through has been classified into

1. svartha — for oneself — one’s own inferential knowl-
edge, through linking it with major and minor premises.

2. parartha — through justification of middle term —
inferential knowledge for another.

3. Pararthanumana — If the motive is for demon-
strating the truth of the conclusion to others it is called
as Pararthanumana. Here, conclusion is arrived at
through justification of the middle term that leads to
it. Aman having inferred the existence of fire in a hill
lays it down as a thesis and proves it as a conclusion
following from the major and minor premises and
their combination into a third premise. The latter has
a five membered syllogism viz., pratijna, hetu, udaha-
rana, upanaya and nigamana.

1*'member ~ Pratijna (preposition) — the hill is fiery
2™4 member — Hetu (reason) — because of smoke

3™ member ~ Udaharana (example) — wherever
smoke exists, fire also exists as in kitchen.

4% member — Upanaya (application / subsumptive
correlative)--— there is smoke on the hill.

5" member — Nigamana (conclusion) — Hence, the
hill is fiery

Apart from above five, the few of the old Naiyayikas
speaks of other five members of syllogism:

° Jijnasa — on the desire to know the truth.
¢ Samsaya — doubt about real nature of a thing.

¢ Shakyaprapti — the capacity of the pramanas to
lead to true knowledge.

¢ Prayojana — the purpose of making an inference

e Samshaya vyudasa — the removal of all doubts the
truth of an inference.

Though Vatsyayana disagreed with the first five and
stated them as irrelevant.

. (b) Research Aptitude

Statement II is the solution for Statement I. For this
purpose, we conduct exploratory study that is more
useful in qualitative research.

In Statement II, there is list of steps in exploratory study.

Research is a continuous process that needs improve-
ment with the passage of time, thus it is non—
exhaustive. Exploratory research mostly deals with
qualitative data. Most of the researchers work on
existing theories or formulations and build on them.
Some researchers are motivated to work on a problem
that has not been studied very clearly to establish pri-
. orities, develop operational definitions and improv-
ing the final research design.

2.43

Much time is spent on exploring the problem so
that better insights are built for the future. It usually
doesn’t lead to a conclusive result. It starts on a gen-
eral idea and we try to specify the related i issues with
the topic of the research.

Exploratory research is inexpensive, highly interactive
and open-ended in nature. There is usually no prior
relevant information available from past researchers.
Since there is no standard for carrying out explor-
atory research, it is usually flexible and scattered.

- (c) Logical Reasoning

This question pertains to irregular behaviour of ‘Mid-
dle Term’. We can solve other questions, linked directly
with Indian philosophy as in the following manner.

The fallacies in Anumana that can be termed as hetv-
abhasha may occur due to the following:

(i) Asiddha: This fallacy occurs due to unproved
hetu. It is also called as Paksadharmata.

(a) Ashrayasiddha: If Paksha (minor term) itself is
unreal, then there cannot be locus of the hetu. For
example, The sky—lotus is fragrant, because it is a
lotus like any other lotus.

(b) Svarupasiddha: It is not possible that Hetu exist in
paksa. For example, sound is a quality, because itis visible.
(c) Vyapyatvasiddha: This is termed as ‘conditional
hetu’. For example, ‘wherever there is fire, there is
smoke’. The presence of smoke is because of wet fuel.

(ii) Savyabhichara: This is termed as the fallacy of
irregular hetu.

(a) Sadharana: Here, the hetu is considered too
wide. It is present in both sapaksa and vipaksa. ‘The
hill has fire because it is knowable’,

(b) Asadharana: Here, the hetu is considered too
narrow. It is present only in the Paksha. It is not pres-
ent in the Sapaksa and in the Vipaksha. For example,
‘sound is eternal because it is audible’.

(c) Anupasamhari:

(iii) Satpratipaksa: In this case, one hetu is contra-
dicted by another hetu. In case, both have equal force,
then nothing should follow. For example, ‘sound
is eternal, because it is audible’, and ‘sound is non—
eternal, because it is produced’, The word, ‘audible’
is counterbalanced by ‘produced’, Here, ‘audible’ and
‘produced’ carry the equal force.

(iv) Badhita: Here, the another proof (as defined by
perception) definitely contradicts and disproves the
middle term (hetu). For example, ‘fire is cold because
it is a substance’.

(v) Viruddha: Here, the virudha, instead of proving
something it is proving the opposite. For example,
‘sound is eternal because it is produced’.

(b) Higher Education System

New Education Policy, 2020 proposes a single regula-
tor for higher education institutions across the coun-
try, that will be called as Higher Education Council of
India (HECD). It will have four verticals for its various
roles.

(i) National Higher Education Regulatory Coun-
cil (NHERC): It will function as the common, single
point regulator for the higher education sector includ-
ing teacher education. It however excludes medical
and legal education.

(ii) National Accreditation Council (NAC) — a
‘meta—accrediting body’): It will be based primarily on
basic norms, public self-disclosure, good governance,
and outcomes. It will be carried out by independent
accrediting institutions supervised and overseen by
NAC.

Giii) Higher Education Grants Council (HEGC): It
will look into funding and financing of colleges and
universities.

(iv) General Education Council (GEC): It will frame
expected learning outcomes for higher education
programmes, also referred to as ‘graduate attributes’.
GEC will formulate a National Higher Education
Qualification Framework (NHEQF).

(b) People, Development and Environment

Here, we have taken a broad view to deal with future
questions. Since 1972, United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP) has been the global authority
to set the environmental agenda, the concept of ‘sus-
tainable development’ for future generations and an
authoritative advocate for the global environment.
UNEP is headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya. It has 193
Member States and representatives from civil society,
businesses, etc. through the UN Environment Assem-
bly, the world’s highest-level decision-making body
on the environment.

UNEP’s Medium—Term Strategy (MTS) articulates its
role in delivering the promises of the ‘2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development and the United Nations
Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)
as well as its outcome document, “The Future We
Want.”

Through its campaigns, particularly ‘World Environ-
ment Day’ (June 5), UNEP raises awareness and advo-
cates for effective environmental action. The Day was
established in 1972 by the UN at ‘Stockholm Con-
ference on the Human Environment’ (5-16 June,

1972). This day is connected with the launch of

‘UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030’.

A step further, UNEP can be further linked with
UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC), Conference of Parties (COPs), Kyoto Pro-

- tocol, Paris Agreement and COP26 Glasgow meeting

asking for Zero Emissions. World seems to have set
Year 2050 as the target year for Zero Emissions and
India has set Year 2070 for its own emissions during
Glasgow COP26 Meeting.

(c) Research Aptitude

Reflexivity: Research should be classified as a “Mis-
sion’, the researchers get in this mission and their own
personalities become part of it. Conducting qualitative
research, such as fieldwork, changes a researcher in
many ways. Through reflexivity, researchers acknowl-
edge the changes brought about in themselves as a
result of the research process and how these changes
have affected the research process. Thus, this reflexiv-
ity is an iterative and empowering process. Reflexiv-
ity should be recognized as a significant part of the
research findings. Thus, it is an analytic attention to
the researcher’s role in qualitative research”, it is both
a concept and a process. As a concept, it refers to a
certain level of consciousness.

There are the few basic principles in the linked quali-
tative research:

(i) Feminist principle

(ii) Rights—based research: the respect of human
rights of participants during the research process.

(iii) Participatory research principles: It recognizes
that people have expert knowledge and deep insight
into their own lives and communities,

(c) Communication / Teaching Aptitude

This question is linked with feedback in the classroom
to make it effective communication. A teacher should
be proficient in all four modes of communication — lis-
tening, speaking, reading, and writing — and should
know how to utilize this proficiency effectively in an
educational institute environment. Being able to do
this has been proven to impact the success students
achieve in their academic lives, as well as the teach-
er’s own Career success.

(a) Logical Reasoning
If ‘all men are mortal’ is true, then ..

To deal with such questions, we need to take help
from ‘square of opposition’.

Contradictories: Contradictory propositions cannot
be simultaneously true and false. If one is true, the
other is necessarily false and vice versa. That is, if ‘A’
is true, then ‘O’ is false; ‘E’ is false.
