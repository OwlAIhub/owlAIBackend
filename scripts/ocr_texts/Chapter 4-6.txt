In a classroom, the contents are delivered to the learners
through the process of communication. The word ‘com-
munication’ derives from the Latin word ‘communicare,’
which means ‘to share,’ emphasizing the notion of making
things common. As we are living in a complicated world,
we need to take a ‘diverse’ perspective of communica-
tion. Oxford University Press defines communication in
precise, comprehensive, and academically oriented man-
ner. They emphasize the exchange of information, ideas,
or feelings between people through speaking, writing, or
using some other medium.

Little’s definitions are known for being concise and
accessible, for them communication is defined as the
act of conveying information and ideas between indi-
viduals, whether through verbal, written, or non-verbal
means.

The ‘technical definition’ of communication covers
the transmission and reception of signals or messages
through a medium, such as spoken words, written text,
or visual images to share the information. Psychological
definition focus on the use of mutually understood signs,
symbols, and semiotic rules. Digital communication focus
on digital formats such as email, and social media tools.
Interpersonal communication covers two or more people.
Business definitions include company, customers, stake-
holders, or the public. Above all, human beings are social
animals, they have diverse set of dynamic needs. So is the
. diversity in our communications.

At its highest level, communication involves building
strong, trusting relationships with individuals whose per-
spectives differ significantly from our own. We have an
innate impulse to communicate with each other for the
betterment of society and personal development.

The Basic Aspects of Communication: Théy are as
follows.

1, Prioritizing our Senses in Communication: Com-
munication goes beyond words; it involves our bodily
gestures, facial expressions, and eye contact. Listen-
ing is equally vital in this world, as everyone desires
to be heard, often seeking feedback.

2. Signs and Symbols in Communication:
Communication is a complex system that utilizes
signs and symbols.

Signs: A ‘sign’ is an object or figure representing a
specific reality, such as the red colorsignaling ‘stop’
in traffic. On the other hand, a ‘symbol’ conveys an
abstract idea linked to societal conventions. For
example, a red rose symbolizes love and affection.
Symbols: as Vygotsky posited, are acquired in social
contexts, internalized, and used to share meaning
with others. They serve as cognitive tools for con-
structing our understanding of the world. The study
of word relationships is known as ‘syntactics.’

3. Effective Communication: Feedback is an essential
element of effective communication as we always

seek clarity. Effective communication is the clear
and successful exchange of information or ideas
that leads to mutual understanding and desired out...
comes. It relies on key elements such as active lis.
tening, empathy, non-verbal cues, timely responses, _
adaptability, respect, conciseness, and goal-oriented
interactions.

4, Modern Age Communication: Today’s communica. |
tion is marked by speed, efficiency, and the ability
to transcend physical and geographical boundar.
ies. Communication occupies 70% or more of our ©
time spent. This prominently includes Social Media
(Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram), Video
Conferencing (Zoom, Skype, Google Meet), Mass
Media, Blogging and Vlogging, Virtual Reality (VR)
and Augmented Reality (AR), Podcasting, discussed |
in Unit 8.

Key Features of Communication

1. Continuous and Dynamic: Communication is an
ongoing, action-driven process with specific objectives,

2. All-Pervasive: Information flows in various direc-
tions within an organization, including top-down,
bottom-up, diagonal, and horizontal channels.

3. Two-way Process: Effective communication includes.
a feedback loop to ensure understanding and
acknowledgment.

4. Context and Relationship: The way a message is
delivered, including content and tone, significantly
influences its effectiveness, with emotions and feel- |
ings often affecting grammar.

5. Symmetry and Complementary: Cormunication
exchanges can be based on either similarity (symme-
try) or differences (complementary), depending on
characteristics.

6. Common Language: Using a shared language
enhances mutual understanding and communication
effectiveness.

7, Meeting of Minds: Effective communication relies on
the recipient comprehending the intended message.

8. Substance of the Message: A message’s significance
depends on the recipient’s interest-in the. subject
matter.

9, Gestures as Communication: Communication
extends beyond words to include non-verbal elements
like gestures, facial expressions, and body language.

10. Different Types of Communication:
Communication can be formal or informal, verbal or
non-verbal, each with its unique characteristics and
contexts.

11. Always Within a Context: Communication takes
place within a framework encompassing physical,
social, psychological, and temporal dimensions that
influence its meaning and impact.

Viacro FuNcTIONS OF COMMUNICATION

1

Emotive Function: They used to convey emotions
and inner states of mind, such as expressions like ‘Oh
My God!’ or ‘Oh no!’

- Directive Function: They to influence the behaviour

of others, typically through requests or commands,
like ‘Fetch me a glass of water, please.’

Phatic Function: They primarily serve to establish,
acknowledge, or reinforce social relations and to ensure
the channel of communication is functioning, e.g.,
‘Hello, is it Ram?’ or ‘Can you hear me, Mrs. Girdhar?’
Poetic Function: This focus on the aesthetic and
artistic aspects of language, emphasizing the mes-
sage itself, like the use of euphony for pleasant speech
sounds, for instance, ‘Asoka The Great.’

Referential Function: They are used to convey infor-
mation and facts, essentially referring to the literal
meaning of the message.

Metalinguistic Function: They focus on the language
code itself, often used in discussions about language,
grammar, or dictionaries.

Contextual Function: They set the tone and creates a
particular context for communication, such as ‘Right!
Let’s start the meeting now.’

Heuristic Function: Language is employed to gain
knowledge, explore, and learn about the environment.
It often involves asking questions and seeking answers.

Additional Functions

1.

2.

Denotation: Denotes the literal, dictionary definition
of a word, without emotional or associative meanings.
Connotation: Refers to the emotional or associa-
tive meanings and suggestions connected to a word,
alongside its denotative meaning.

Simile: Compares two dissimilar objects using words
like ‘as’ or ‘like,’ creating a comparison, e.g., ‘my boy-
friend is like a watermelon in the summer.’
Metaphor: Compares two dissimilar objects without
using ‘as’ or ‘like,’ implying a direct resemblance, e.g.,
‘my boyfriend is an angel.’

These functions help us understand the various purposes
and nuances of communication in different contexts.

EVOLUTION OF COMMUNICATION

The communication evolution is connected with the pro-
gress of mankind, related technologies and by transcend-
ing physical or geographical boundaries. It impacted
speed, efficiency and ability of communication. Now
there is globalization of communication.

Prehistoric Communication

° Non-verbal communication: facial expressions, ges-
tures, body language, and vocalizations.

° Cave paintingson cave wails: often depicting animals,
hunting scenes, and other aspects of prehistoric life.

® Petroglyphs: These are images carved into rock
surfaces.

Ancient Communication -

© Writing: use of symbols to represent words and ideas.
The first writing systems were developed in Mesopota-
mia and Egypt around 3500 sc.

¢ Cuneiform is one of the earliest known writing systems,
originating in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq)
around 3200 scz. Cuneiform consists of wedge- -shaped
characters or symbols made by i impressing a stylus into
clay tablets.

® Hieroglyphics is an ancient Egyptian writing system
with its roots dating back to around 3200 scr. Hiero-
glyphics are pictorial characters that represent objects,
concepts, and sounds. They are often displayed in a
combination of images and symbols.

° Smoke signals: technique to send messages over long
distances by creating smoke with fires.

° Carrier pigeons: These birds were used to carry mes-
sages between people.

Medieval Communication

° Printing press: mass-production of books and other
printed materials, which resulted in dramatic increase
in literacy rates.
The name of Johannes Gutenberg’s invention of the
printing press in the 15th century can be associated
with this.

° Postal service: This government-run organization
delivered letters and other mail to people throughout
the world.

Modern Communication

° Telegraph: This invention allowed people to send mes-
sages over long distances using electrical signals.

° Telephone: This invention allowed people to communi-
cate with each other in real time over long distances. We

can associate the name of Alexander Graham Bell’s with
the invention of the telephone in the late 19th century,
° Radio: This invention allowed people to broadcast mes-
sages to a wide audience.
° Television: This invention allowed people to watch
moving images and hear sound transmitted over long
distances.
° Computers: These machines have revolutionized com.
munication by making it possible to send and receive mes-
sages, information, and data instantly over long distances,

During the 21st century, the technologies have made it _
possible for people to communicate with each other in
new and innovative manners through the internet, social
media and mobile devices. These have been discussed in
detail in

eighth unit of ICT.

PERSPECTIVES ON COMMUNICATION

Here is a brief overview of each perspective that reflects
some evolution of communication also:

° Mechanistic viewpoint: The communication is precise
and flawless transmission of a message from the sender
to the receiver. It focuses on the technical and structural
aspects of the message exchange.

° Psychological aspect: This perspective views com-

munication as going beyond the message itself to

encompass the receiver’s emotional response when
interpreting the message. It recognizes the profound’
impact that emotions and psychological factors have on
effective communication.

Social constructionist perspective: This perceives

communication as a product of interactants collabora-

tively sharing and creating meaning from messages. It
contrasts with the ‘transmission model,’ which portrays |
communication as a mechanical, computer-like process.

Systemic outlook: The communication is a dynamic

system in which individuals interact through symbols

to generate and interpret meanings. New messages
are formed through a process called ‘throughput,’ and
they evolve as they travel through the communication
network,
Critical approach: The communication is a source of
power dynamics and potential oppression of individuals
and social groups. Examining communication through
this lens provides a framework for understanding how
communication is shaped within the boundaries of spe-
cific theories, shedding light on issues related to power,
social structures, and inequalities.

TRANSMISSION OR LINEAR Mopet

This model defines communication as a ‘one-way process’,
where a message is sent and received. It’s often referred
to as a pipeline or container model, emphasizing a lack of
feedback.

Aristotle Model (300 BC)

Aristotle’s ancient model of communication, while being
simple, this offers timeless insights into effective commu-
nication, particularly in persuasive contexts like public
speaking, seminars, and lectures. It has the following ele-
ments.

1. Sender, speaker or ‘rhetor’: Being ‘rhetoric’ is the art
of persuasion. They begin the communication. Their
role is to convey a message to the audience, with the
purpose to persuade, inform, or entertain. So, their
effectiveness depends on their ability to present their
message in a clear, engaging, and convincing manner.

2. Message: The message is the core content deliv-
ered by the sender. Its effectiveness is determined
by its clarity, organization, relevance, and persua-
sive power. Clarity means easily understandable and
thus avoiding any ambiguity or confusion. ‘Persuasive
Power’ means that message is compelling, capable of
influencing or engaging the audience. Being relevant

Advanced Schramm Model

Various communication models serve as essential tools
for evaluating and enhancing the flow of information
over time. They also provide guidance for future com:
munication practices. These models offer a mechanistic
perspective on human communication, focusing on the
flow of information as a primarily one-way transmission
process. Analyzing the relationships among differen;
variables is crucial for improving communication effec.
tiveness.

Alex Fish has introduced three key communication
models:

Leagan’s Model _

Barnlund’s Transactional Model
of Communication

1955 Rogers and ee Model
1953 Becker’ s Mosaic Model
1957 = Constitutive Metamodel
1967 Frank Dance’s Helical Model

means that message addresses the interests, needs, or
concerns of audience.

3. Audience (listener or rhetorician): They interpret,
understand, and respond to the message, thus they
play a crucial role in the success of communicator or
say overall communication process. Aristotle empha-
sized the importance of tailoring the message to the
specific needs and interests of the audience.

Aristotle also introduced three persuasive techniques to
enhance communication effectiveness:

1. Ethos: Credibility of the speaker, building trust and
authority. /

2. Pathos: Emotional appeal to connect and persuade
the audience.

3. Logos: Logical reasoning using facts and rational

arguments. |

Overall, Aristotle’s model is basic, linear and it doesn’t
account for the complexities of modern, multi-channel,
and interactive communication. The focus is on audience,
and it fits into traditional or contemporary settings.

Lasswell’s Model (1948)

This model views communication as the transmission of
a message with a measurable impact on the receiver’s
behaviour. This model is also known as the ‘Lasswell

Shannon-Weaver model of Communication (1949):

This model provided us a visual model of communica-
tion in context of electronic media (telegraphed com-
munication). It is also known as ‘Mathematical Model of
Communication’.

These are the following three main aspects in communi-
cation:

1. Technical Aspect: This ensures the accurate transmis-
sion and reception of the message.

2. Semantic Aspect: This ensures the clarity and correct
interpretation of the message’s meaning.

3. Effectiveness Aspect: This ensures the message has
the desired impact or influence on the receiver.

Noise: This refers to any external or internal interference
that disrupts the clarity and effectiveness of the message
transmission and reception. This can include physical dis-
turbances, like background sounds, as well as psychologi-
cal factors, such as misinterpretations or preconceived
notions.

Norbert Wiener addition of feedback changed the
model from a linear to a cyclical model, which more accu-
rately reflects the nature of human communication.

{a) Entropy: Entropy is a measure of the degree of dis-
order, unpredictability, or randomness in a message

1. Negative Entropy: This represents a higher
degree of order in communication. It indicates
that the message is well-structured and lacks dis-
order or randomness. In other words, a message
with low entropy is highly organized.

actual effect of the message on the receiver?

Two Points to be noted down:

.° ‘Who’ and ‘To whom’ denotes situation depending upon
human sciences.

e ‘Says what’ and ‘With what effects’ denotes physical
sciences.

These communication models play a critical role in
assessing information flow and promoting more effective
communication practices, making them valuable tools for
communication analysis and improvement.

Received

Figure 4.2 Shannon-weaver Information Model

2. Positive Entropy: This signifies growing disorder,
confusion or uncertainty in the message. It means
that the information is becoming less structured
and more random. Higher entropy can lead to
signaling errors, making it crucial to maintain the
desired level of entropy.

3. Relative Entropy: This is the ratio of the actual
entropy of a message to the maximum possible
entropy. It helps assess how close a message is to
the highest level of disorder or randomness.

A balance between order and randomness is impor-

tant for effective communication.

(b) Redundancy: The extra and unnecessary informa-
tion in a message makes communication less efficient.
‘High Redundancy’ means there’s too much repeated .
and unnecessary stuff in a message, which can be con-
fusing. So we need to avoid redundancy by using key
information and simple language. For example, we
may say ‘midnight’ instead of ‘twelve midnight.’

(c) Channel capacity: This means the maximum amount
of information that can be transmitted through a com-
munication channel in a given unit of time. Beyond
this capacity, communication may experience errors
or degradation in quality. This helps to minimize
errors and ensure information is accurately transmit-
ted. Channel capacity is more applicable in interper-
sonal communication, where the focus is on one-on-
one interactions.

Berlo’s S-M-C-R model Bold (1960)

This model initially is a Sender-Receiver model, has been
expanded to include Source, Message, Channel, and
Receiver (S-M-C-R Model). This model portrays commu-
nication as a linear process without feedback or the con-
sideration of noise or barriers.

Inreractive MopeL. of ComMUNICATION

The term ‘interactive’ in communication denotes a two-
way process in which both the sender and receiver actively
participate. This dynamic occurs because feedback is inte-
gral to the process, serving to clarify messages, confirm
understanding, or offer additional information. Essen-
tially, interactive model represents two-way, non-linear
communication. Because of interactive exchanges, feed-
back and specific contexts of being cultural, social and
physical, this is also called as the convergence model.

Field of Experience: Communication styles differ based
on cultural backgrounds and personal experiences. Peo-
ple interpret messages through the lens of their own expe-
riences, influenced by culture and social context. Misun-
. derstandings can occur when these differences aren’t
acknowledged, making awareness crucial in diverse inter-
actions.

Example: An American, accustomed to direct communi-
cation, may find a Japanese person’s indirect approach
evasive, while the Japanese might perceive the Ameri-
can’s bluntness as rude. This can lead to misunderstand-
ings due to their differing communication styles.

Noise: This, in the form of interference or distractions,
can disrupt the communication process, but it is consid-
ered an external factor rather than an integral part of
communication.

Figure 4.4 Schramm Communication Model

Types oF Interactive MopeLs

Osgood-Schramm Circular Model (1954):

This model makes an addition to Shannon and Weaver's
model. This is built upon the shared roles of sender and
receiver in effective communication which may be termed
as reciprocal roles. Due to continuity of such roles, a feed-
back loop is created. It considers the elements such as the
field of experience, encoding and decoding, redundancy,
feedback, and noise. This model is more straightforward
and easier to comprehend, making it versatile for various
communication scenarios.

Schramm’s Advanced Model of Communication
(1997):

This model provided a more sophisticated and compre-
hensive framework. This acknowledges communication
through various channels, including verbal,- nonverbal,
and technological means,

° There is inclusion of noise sources like environmental
factors and cultural differences which disrupt mes-
sage encoding and decoding. The individual back-
grounds and perspectives influencing message inter-
pretation.

° There is inclusion of ‘Feedback Loop’ for effective
communication.

° This considers media effects, cultural contexts, and
social dynamics in communication.

on societal dynamics, beyond just the direct influence of
mass media.

Gatekeepers: Gatekeepers in communication decide what
information reaches the public. They include news editors,

‘social media influencers, and PR professionals, controlling

and shaping the news and information flow. The name of

Kurt Lewin is also associated with gatekeepers.

LEE Er z 2s

Opinion Leaders: These are influential figures in their
ommunities, like celebrities, politicians, and experts.
They shape public opinion and others’ behaviors.

q{wo-Step Flow of Communication: In Katz’s model,
information reaches the public in two steps. First, media
ives information to opinion leaders, who then share it
with their networks.

Other personality, Daniel Katz, a psychologist known for
is theory on managerial skills. In 1955, identified three
ritical skills for effective leadership and management:
echnical, human, and conceptual skills.

Frank Dance’s Helical Model (1967)

Dance’s model views communication as a circular and grow-
ing process, represented by a helical spiral. It challenges the
eparation of linearity and circularity in communication.

Newcomb’s Model (1953)

Newcomb’s model shows three parts: the sender, receiver,

nd society, highlighting how communication keeps soci-

ty balanced.

° This model is used to study different types of commu-
nication, like changing attitudes, persuading, resolv-
ing conflicts, building relationships, and more.

This model builds on Newcomb’s Model. This looks at
‘gatekeepers, environment, culture, and personal factors
which offer different viewpoints on communication and
make it better. It helps understand mass communication
in society and culture.

Watzlawick Model (1967)
There are five basic axioms:

1. Even when we are silent or trying to avoid commu-
nication, we are still communicating something. For
example, if we are sitting in a meeting with our arms
crossed and a frown on our face, we are communicat-
ing that we are unhappy or disinterested.

2. Every communication has a content and a relation-
ship dimension.

3. The nature of a relationship is determined by the
punctuation of the sequences of communication
between the participants.

4. Human communication is both digital and analog.
Digital communication: words, written language,
numbers, symbols
Analog communication: tone of voice, facial expres-
sions, body language, gestures, eye contact, proximity

5. All communication is either symmetrical or
complementary.

The success of this model focus on the integration of
internal realities (mainly physical and social contexts),
individual experiences, nonverbal cues, field of experi-
ence, group dynamics. :

| Robert T. Craig’s Metamodel (1999): Craig has
| given ‘Communication As a Field Model’. This met-
amodel is beyond linear, interactive and transac-
tional. This has adopted an integrated approach.

| Craig model views communication as a dynamic
| process in which participants actively shape the
| meaning of messages. It is also considered to be an
| interactive model, this helps in the understanding
| of other models. He has given us the seven tradi-
tions of communication:

1. Rhetorical: The practical art of discourse

2. Semiotic: The mediation by signs

3. Phenomenological: The experience of dia-
logue with others

4. Cybernetic: The flow of information

5. Socio-psychological: The interaction of
individuals

6. Socio-cultural: The production and reproduc-
tion of the social order ,

7. Critical: A process in which all assumptions

can be challenged

Suirt TOWARDS TRANSACTIONAL MopeLs

The shift began in the mid-20th century. The transition
from interactive to transactional communication models
has occurred across various fields such as technology, psy-
chology, and education, as outlined below:

1. Role of Technology: Transactional models became
prominent with the technologies, with internet also
added to it. This facilitated direct communication and
reflecting global cultural shifts.

2. Impact on Education: This change is evident in edu-

. cation, with a greater focus on interactive learning
and joint content creation.

3. Psychological Approach: Interactive models in psy-
chology mostly focused on stimulus-response, view-
ing individuals as separate. In contrast, transactional
models see communication as a dynamic, collabora-
tive process.

THE TRANSACTIONAL MopeL

This model emphasize the dynamic, reciprocal, and
context-dependent nature of communication. The main
points are as follows:

1. Simultaneous Sending and Receiving: Unlike earlier
models, the transactional model gives equal treatment
to all the parties in the communication process. They
are considered as ‘sirnultaneous’ senders and receivers,
engaging in a constant exchange of messages.

2. Dynamic and Continuous: Communication is viewed
as an ongoing, ever-changing process influenced by the
interactions and relationships between communicators.

3. Shared Field of Experience: Effective communica-
tion in the transactional model depends on the over-
lapping experiences, backgrounds, and perceptions
of the communicators, which shape understanding
and meaning.

4. Context-Dependent: The communication is influ-
enced by the surrounding context, including social,
cultural, and environmental factors.

5. Feedback and Interaction: Feedback is integral and
continuous, allowing for constant adjustment and
mutual influence within the communication process.

6. Co-Creation of Meaning: Meaning is not simply
transmitted from sender to receiver but is collabora-
tively constructed through interaction.

7. Influence of Noise: The model considers both exter-
nal noise (physical disturbances) and internal noise
(psychological or emotional barriers) that can affect
the communication process.

Leagan’s Model (1961)

This model designed for ‘extension education,’ has the fol-
lowing points:

1. Skilled Communicator: The successful communica-
tor can effectively convey a useful message.

2. Proper Channel: This ensures that the message reaches
the intended audience effectively,

3. Effective Treatment: This is required to resonate |
with the audience and generate the desired response.

4. Audience: Understanding the audience and their
~ needs is central to effective communication.

5. Audience Response: The ultimate goal is to elicit the
desired response from the audience. These elements.

are key to Leagan’s model for extension education,

Barnlund’s Transactional Model (1970)

This refers to the following.

1. Cues: Cues are signs or indicators that play-a cru.
cial role in communication. They are used to conve

meaning and influence actions. They are basically of :

two types: .

¢ Public Cues: These are external and can include
elements from the physical or environmental sur.
roundings. For instance, a stop sign on the road is
a public cue.

° Private Cues: These are related to a person’s
senses and can be both verbal (e.g., spoken
words) and non-verbal (e.g., facial expressions,
body language, or tone of voice).

Speech Act: Speech acts are crucial because they 20
beyond the mere transmission of information; they
have the power to create change, influence behav-
iour, and shape relationships. Here, individuals use
language or gestures to perform an action, such as
making a request, giving an order, asking a question,
or making a promise.

° Filters: Filters in communication are factors that _

influence how individuals perceive and respond
to messages. The messages are same but their
perception by different people is different, that
depends uopn the unique backgrounds, experi-
ences, beliefs and perspectives of people. Their
understanding is essential for ensuring effective
communication. For example, even though the
teacher says the same thing, students can under-
stand and react differently because of their own
thoughts and experiences.

3. Noise: As discussed, noise is a common cause in com-
munication that interrupts the smooth exchange of
messages. Noise can come in different forms such
as physical noise (distractions such as loud sounds),
semantic noise (misunderstanding words or phrases)
and psychological noise (when feelings and emotions
makes the message less clear).

4. Shared Field Experience: This means that commu-
nicators have common ground or shared context that
helps them understand each other. The exchange of
messages is simultaneous.

This is considered as the best systematic transactional
model.

more focused on the content and construction of mes-
sages rather than the process of communication itself.

We communicate with each other in different manners
that totally depends’ upon the message and context in
which it is being forwarded. The choice and style of chan-
nel also affects communication.

CLASSIFICATION ON THE Basis OF RELATIONSHIP

Intrapersonal Communication stands out with the fol-
lowing key points:

1. Individual Scope: Intrapersonal communication
primarily occurs within an individual, encompassing
activities like self-talk, self-listening, and self-relat-
ing.

2. Reflection and Contemplation: It involves personal
reflection, meditation, contemplation, and even
prayer, serving as a channel for introspection and
self-exploration.

3. Internal Thought Formulation: Intrapersonal com-
munication involves the internal conceptualization
and formulation of thoughts and ideas before they
are externally expressed. Common examples include
muttering phrases like ‘Oh my god,’ ‘Oh no,’ ‘Wow,’
and ‘Thank god’ as part of self-dialogue.

INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION

Interpersonal Communication is characterized by the fol-
lowing significant points:

1. Dyadic Communication: It’s also referred to as
dyadic communication, involving two individuals in
face-to-face routine communication.

2. Universal and Face-to-Face: It’s a widespread form of
communication that occurs between two people and
encompasses both sending and receiving messages.

3. Formal and Informal: Interpersonal communication
can be either formal or informal, encompassing both
verbal and non-verbal elements.

4. Versatile Mediums: It can take place anywhere and
utilizes words, sounds, facial expressions, gestures,
and postures for expression.

5. Immediate Feedback: It offers immediate feedback
enhancing its effectiveness. :
6. Emotional Appeal: Due to the proximity between
sender and receiver, interpersonal communication
carries an emotional appeal, motivating, encourag.
ing, and facilitating effective coordination.
7. Relational Dependence: The effectiveness of interpey.
sonal communication hinges on the mutual relationship
between communicators, their status, roles, and skills.
8. Scope for Grapevine: It has a broader scope for infor.
mal communication or grapevine.

Interpersonal communication can further be categorized
into formal settings such as meetings and conferences ang _
informal settings like private discussions with family oy |
friends.

Oral Communication

Oral communication involves spoken words in. various
forms, like face-to-face conversations, speeches, phone
calls, videos, radio, TV, and internet voice chats. Key fac-

tors affecting oral communication include: :

1. Pitch and Volume: Pitch, the highness or lowness of |
tone, and volume, the loudness of speech, influence
how a message is received. Variations in pitch can add’
interest, while a monotonous voice can bore or con-
vey different emotions.

2. Rate: The speed of speech delivery is impor
tant. Regular, rhythmic speech appears confident,
while irregular speech may indicate uncertainty or
frustration.

3. Clarity and Articulation: Proper pronunciation and
clear delivery are essential for effective communica-
tion. Clarity depends on both pronunciation and the
communicator’s thought clarity.

Paralanguage includes these aspects of pitch, volume, |
rate, and clarity in oral communication. It also benefits
from spontaneity, naturalness, a wide vocabulary, and
support from non-verbal cues.

However, oral communication is temporary, as spoken
words vanish, and it may be subject to cultural misunder-
standings due to non-verbal cues. -

Written Communication

This involves using written words and symbols, such as
printed or handwritten text, along with visual aids like
pictures and graphs to make the message clear. It depends
the writer’s skills, style, and grammar knowledge.

There are two sides to written communication: inter-
nal and external. Internally, it’s about memos, reports,
emails, and documents that help communication within
an organization. Externally, it covers emails, websites, let-
ters, contracts, and more, which help communicate with
others outside the organization.

The benefits of written communication are that we
can edit messages before sending them, creating a per-

anent record for reference. It also ensures the receiver
fully understands the message and allows for appropriate
feedback. But it can lack immediate responses and some-
times takes longer than speaking. In real life, we often use

Mnemonics: Aids for Better Memory

Mnemonics are memory-enhancing tools used to learn
and remember words, numbers, facts, and more in
arious situations. These tools are particularly helpful
or recalling longer lists, such as characteristics, steps,
stages, or parts of something. Research by Gerald R.
Miller in 1967 showed that mnemonics can significantly
Mprove recall. They can even assist in remembering
words and numbers. For example, the acronym BRASS
an help remember the steps for shooting a rifle: Breath,
elax, Aim, Sight, Squeeze. Mnemonics are valuable for
ote-taking as well.

» Non-verbal Communication

‘on-verbal communication encompasses the transmis-
lon of messages through non-verbal channels, including
acial expressions, gestures, posture, and body language,
's well as the use of social cues, kinesics, distance, physi-
al environments, appearance, sounds, and touch.

both written and spoken communication to meet differ-

4.13

Types of non-verbal communication can be categorized
as follows:

‘1. Facial Expression: Facial expressions convey various
emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise,
and fear. For instance, a smiling face or an expression
that matches what is being said can enhance commu-
nication.

Posture: Postures represent different positions of

the body and can reflect confidence and feelings.

Maintaining a relaxed posture, straight shoulders,

sitting upright, and keeping hands by the sides when

standing are recommended.

3. Gestures or Body Language: Gestures involve
bodily movements, particularly involving the hands
or head, to express ideas or meanings. Examples
include waving, pointing, or using hand gestures
while speaking. Different gestures may indicate ask-
ing a question, displaying anxiety (like biting nails),
or greetings. It’s advisable to avoid pointing at peo-
ple with fingers or bending the head while listening
or greeting.

4. Touch: Communication through touch includes
actions such as shaking hands and patting on the back
to convey approval or reward.

5. Space: Maintaining physical distance between indi-
viduals during communication is essential.

6. Eye Contact: The way people look at someone can
convey their level of interest, anger, or other emotions.

7. Paralanguage: This aspect involves how people
speak, encompassing the tone, speed, and volume
of their speech. Speaking too fast may indicate hap-
piness, excitement, or nervousness, while speaking
slowly may suggest seriousness or sadness.

ad

Non-verbal communication can be further categorized
into two main groups: static and dynamic features. Here’s
a breakdown:

Static Features

° Distance: The physical distance between individuals
can convey messages related to attraction, status, or the
intensity of the exchange.

* Orientation: How people present themselves, whether
face-to-face, side-to-side, or back-to-back, can signify
cooperation, competition, or other aspects of their
interaction.

° Physical Contact: Actions like shaking hands, touch-
ing, hugging, or patting on the back can indicate inti-
macy or a sense of attraction.

¢ Posture: The way individuals position themselves is a
significant aspect of non-verbal communication.

Dynamic Features

° Facial Expressions: Expressions like smiles, frowns,
raised eyebrows, yawns, and sneers convey emotional
information and are continuously monitored during
interactions.

° Gestures: Hand movements and gestures are com-
monly used during conversations. While some gestures



=== Page 14 ===
414

have universal meanings, many are individually learned
and idiosyncratic.

° Eye Contact: A crucial element of social communica-
tion, eye contact can convey emotions, signal conver-
sation cues, or indicate aversion. The frequency of eye
contact can suggest interest or boredom.

Visual Communication: Enhancing Ideas
Through Images

Visual communication is the use of visual aids to con-
vey ideas and information in formats that can be seen or
read. It encompasses two-dimensional images, including
signs, typography, drawings, graphic design, illustrations,
colors, and electronic resources.

Eight Types of Non-verbal Communication

Non-verbal communication comprises eight distinct
types, each with its own set of non-verbal signals that can
enhance loyalty and rapport in interpersonal interactions:

1. Proxemics: Proxemics refers to the use of personal
and physical space to convey non-verbal messages
related to intimacy, affection, aggression, or domi-
nance. The spatial relationships between individuals
can significantly affect communication.

2. Paralinguistic: Paralinguistic elements are the non-
verbal aspects of speech that complement the spoken
words. These include the timing, pace, tone, loud-
ness, pitch, volume, rate, quality, intonation, inflec-
tion, and vocalized pauses in one’s speech.

3. Kinesics: Kinesics involves various body signals that
amplify the meaning of communication. These sig-
nals include gestures, eye contact, facial expressions,
posture, locomotion, and haptics (touch). The inter-
pretation of these signals can vary across cultures.
Haptics: Haptics pertains to the way touch is used
to communicate. Different reactions may arise from
unsolicited touch, and cultural norms play a role in
determining acceptable touch behaviours. Examples
include a gentle touch on the forearm, a two-handed
handshake, or a slight kiss on the cheek.

5. Phonemics: Phonemics is a linguistic aspect of non-

>

verbal communication, focusing on the distinctions -

made by sounds in a particular language. Phonemes
are the units of sound that differentiate one word
from another within a language.

6. Dress and Appearance: The meaning conveyed
through dress and appearance varies depending on
the situation and context. Clothing and grooming
choices can send both intended and unintended mes-
sages to those receiving the communication.

7. Chromatics: Chromatics involve communication
through the use of colour. colours of clothing, prod-
ucts, or gifts can convey specific messages to the
recipients, whether consciously or subconsciously.

8. Iconic: Iconic systems are employed to represent
words or linguistic concepts through symbols or
icons. Examples. include different types of ‘emoti-
cons’ used to convey ideas and emotions in written
communication.

Codes: In communication, codes are consistent rules for
replacing a piece of information, such as a letter, word, or
phrase, with a selected equivalent. Codes are used to con-
vey messages efficiently and can vary between different
forms of communication.

Communication Impact: As per Mehrabian

According to Mehrabian, communication can be broken
down into three aspects:

° Words contribute 7%.
° Tone of voice makes up 38%.
° Body language accounts for 55%.

These percentages are often referred to as the 7/38/55
rule, and they are also known as the ‘3 V’s’ - Verbal, Vocal,
and Visual. In practice, effective communication com-
bines both spoken and non-verbal elements.

Attention Factors in Teaching

In teaching, getting a student’s attention is seen as the first
step towards positive development and fostering interest.
Research has revealed that people seek attention in the
following proportions:

* Seeing: 87%

° Hearing: 7%

° Smell: 3.5%

® Touch: 1.5%

This means that visual elements are particularly crucial
for grabbing attention

CLASSIFICATION: BASED ON Purpose AND STYLE

These can also be taken as the main categories of com-
munication.

Formal Communication .

Formal communication is characterized by the structured
flow of official information through predefined channels
and routes within an organization. Several key points
about formal communication include:

1. Controlled Flow: Formal communication is controlled
and regulated, requiring deliberate efforts to ensure
accurate and appropriate information exchange. This
structured approach helps maintain order and consis-
tency in organizational communication.



=== Page 15 ===
415

9, Hierarchical Structure: It typically follows a hierar-
chical structure and a chain of command. Information
primarily flows from senior to lower-level employees.
This ensures that each employee knows their role and
responsibilities within the organization.

3, Obligation to Follow Channels: Employees are
obligated to follow formal communication chan-
nels when performing their duties. This adherence
to established protocols is essential for maintaining

_ order and avoiding confusion.

4. Communication Tools: Formal communication

utilizes a variety of tools and methods to transmit

information. These may include memos, intranet
platforms, meetings, conferences, formal one-on-one
interactions, bulletin boards, handouts, letters, pre-

cules for sentations, speeches, notice boards, organizational
word, or blogs, emails, and more.

1 to con. Examples: Specific examples of formal communica-
lifferent tion include a department head conveying information

to their team through a memo, an organization’s top
management addressing employees in a formal meet-
ing, or a principal communicating with an assistant
professor through the head of the department (HoD).

In essence, formal communication is a structured and
controlled mode of information exchange that plays a
crucial role in maintaining order and ensuring that rel-
evant information is disseminated through established
_ channels within an organization.

_ points about informal communication include:
1

Context: Informal communication typically takes
place within informal group conversations, often
among employees who share social relations. It is
not constrained by formal structures or predefined
channels.

. Characteristics: Informal communication is charac-

terized by being free, multi-dimensional, diverse, and
quicker compared to formal communication. It is a
more natural and relational mode of communication.

- Lack of Predefined Routes: Unlike formal commu-

nication, informal communication does not follow
predefined channels or communication routes. It is
spontaneous and occurs as needed.

- Absence of Paper Trail: Informal communica-

tion does not leave a paper trail. It relies on verbal
exchanges, making it less documented compared to
formal communication.

» Ways of Informal Communication: Informal com-

munication can take various forms, including:

° Grapevine: Often originating from employees’
social relations, the grapevine is an informal and
unofficial communication system within the organ-
ization. It involves the casual exchange of informa-
tion among employees.

° Gossip: In this form, one person plays a central role
by seeking and sharing information with others,
leading to informal discussions and exchanges.

* Single Strand: In single strand communication,
each person communicates with the next in a linear
sequence, creating a chain of informal information
exchange.

° Cluster Networks: In this scenario, a person
receives information and passes it on to their clus-
ter network of contacts or may keep the information
within their network. Each individual in a cluster
network can further transmit the information.

¢ Probability Chain: This form of informal commu-
nication involves individuals randomly sharing the
same piece of information with other individuals.
The information spreads through the organization
in an unpredictable manner.

Overall, informal communication is a flexible and
organic mode of information exchange that complements
the formal communication structures within an organiza-
tion. It allows for quick, diverse, and often more personal
interactions among employees.

CLASSIFICATION ON THE BASIS OF DIRECTION

Vertical Communication

1. This is basically formal communication.
2. This can be upwards (bottom-up) and
downwards(top—bottom).

Lateral or Horizontal Communication

1. Involves communication with peers and colleagues at
the same hierarchical level.

2. Can encompass both formal and informal
communication.

3. Is highly effective and not hindered by a chain of com-
mand, promoting teamwork.

4. Varies in intensity depending on an organization’s
culture and structure.

Diagonal Communication

1. Hierarchy Bypass: Diagonal communication elimi-
nates hierarchical boundaries, allowing information to
flow freely across different positions and status levels.

2. Relationship Building: It helps foster relationships
and bonding between superiors and subordinates,
promoting better collaboration and understanding
within the organization.

Communication Network

1. Chain Network: This type follows a formal chain of
command where members communicate with each
other in a predetermined sequence, resembling a
bureaucratic organization.

2. Wheel Network (STAR Network): In this network,
information flows. from one central member to the
rest. It’s akin to a star, where all communication is
channeled through a central supervisor, which can be
less effective for team communication.



=== Page 16 ===
4.16

3. Circle Network: Members communicate informally
with adjacent members based on shared experiences,
beliefs, expertise, background, or office location. It
often operates autonomously.

4. All-Channel Network: Found in teams, this network
exhibits high intensity and frequency of interaction
among members. Information flows in all directions,
with no formal leader, and any member can initiate
communication.

Mass media refers to various forms of communication and
information dissemination, such as newspapers, television,
radio, magazines, and the internet, designed to reach and
influence a large and diverse audience simultaneously. It
plays a crucial role in sharing news, entertainment, adver-
tising, and educational content on a broad scale.

° Mass communication has three key characteristics:

1. Alarge and heterogeneous audience
2. An institutional or group source
3. The use of mechanisms to reproduce information.

It involves mediated communication through channels
known as mass media.
° The concept of mass media gained popularity in the
20th century, driven by advancements in technology
that allowed the widespread duplication of material.
Mass media encompasses various forms such as radio,
television, newspapers, magazines, the Internet, social
media, podcasting, and blogging.
° Mainstream Media (MSM) refers to media outlets
aligned with the prevailing direction of influence in
the culture at large. The media is often regarded as the
‘Fourth Pillar of Democracy’.
° The four pillars of democracy are: Judiciary, Executive,
Legislature and Media (Press).

the transmission model but places more emphasis
on external interpretation by observers than on the
intended purposes of senders and receivers.
Attention-gaining Model: This model focuses on
attracting and retaining audiences. Audiences often
see media as a form of escape and diversion. It stands
in contrast to the previous two models. Media culture
and practice must establish strong connections with
the goal of holding attention, with attention mea-
sured by time allocation and intensity of involvement.

Evolution of Mass Media

_1. Evolution of mass media in India from the 15th cen-
tury to the 21st century, categorized as the ‘seven
mass Media Pillars’ which include print, recordings,
cinema, radio, television, the internet, and mobile
phones.

The Internet and mobile phones are collectively
referred to as ‘digital media,’

- Digitization of the news industry has led to the rapid
dissemination of news and images from around the
world.

The categories of electronic and print media include
broadcasting, various types of discs or tape, film, inter-
net (blogs and podcasts), publishing (newspapers, books,
magazines), and computer games.

Mass Meoia Functions sy Haro_p Lassweie

1. Surveillance: Mass media serves as the ears, eyes,
and voice of the audience, informing and influencing
thoughts, attitudes, and actions. For instance, adver-
tisements introduce consumers to new products.

2. Correlation: Mass media plays a role in shaping pub-
lic opinion, contributing to the creation of societal
consensus on important issues.

3. Admission of Social Inheritance: Mass media has
assumed the function of transmitting social inheri-
tance, which was previously carried out by parents,
teachers, and other elders. It provides frames of refer-
ence for society and serves as a medium for transmit-
ting knowledge and values.

Additional functions of mass media include:

1. Cultivating perceptions and shaping public opinion.
2. Agenda setting, influencing the political agenda.

3. Establishing a connection between the government
and the public.

4. Bridging the knowledge gap by providing information.

Recall of Few Mass Media Linked Popular Terms

* Gatekeepers are individuals working in mass media
responsible for deciding what gets printed, produced,
or broadcasted.

Entropy is the tendency of a communication system to
move from a state of order to disorder, often associated
with highly infiuential media.

New Wave is an experimental style of film-making char-
acterized by its lack of an elaborate plot, chronological
continuity, and theatrical elements.

Prime Time refers to the period when mass media has
its largest audience.

Yellow Journalism is sensationalized journalism that
uses shocking headlines to attract attention, even if it
lacks real news and facts,

° Alternative Media, a type of mass media, often has a
smaller audience than mainstream media but uses tech-
nology to reach many people.

Participatory Media allows individuals to create con-
tent without traditional editorial structures, often ena-
bled by technology.

Embedded Journalists are journalists inserted into
military units by governments to provide first hand
reports.

Multimedia is an integrated system that seamlessly
combines data, text, images, and sound in a digital
information environment.

Public Relations plays a role in informing, resolving
conflicts, and improving understanding between indi-
viduals and groups.

Impact of Mass Media on Society

1. Mass media serves as an educational tool by inform-
ing people about the world beyond their immediate
surroundings.

2. It plays a crucial role in accountability, including con-
cepts like advocacy and surveillance.

‘3. Mass media contributes to the promotion of cultural
diversity.

Main THeortes ofr Mass Mepia

Hypodermic or Bullet Theory

¢ This suggests mass media can have a direct and power-
ful influence on passive audiences.

e Audiences can be manipulated by media messages that
are perceived as magic bullets.

Psychological or Individual Difference Theory

° Individual personality variables result in different reac-
tions to media stimuli.

° Selective exposure and selective perception are impor-
tant factors.

° Selective exposure refers to people seeking informa-
tion in line with their established beliefs, while selective
perception involves interpreting messages to suit their
preferences.

Cognitive Dissonance Theory

° This dissonance arises from contradictory thoughts.

People seek balanced beliefs to avoid cognitive
dissonance.

¢ Perceptual differences based on social group status are
termed ‘standpoint theory.’

Personal Influence Theory

* Interpersonal relationships, not mass media, signifi-
cantly influence people.

° Opinion leaders play a crucial role in transmitting media
information to others.

fictional shows. They start thinking and believing things
they see on TV.

¢ Mean World Syndrome: If we watch a TV loaded with
violence and crime, we might start thinking the world is
more dangerous and violent than it actually is.
Mainstreaming: When many people watch TV, they all
start to think similar things, no matter where they come
from or who they are. They become homogeneous.

° Agenda Setting Theory emphasizes media’s role in
shaping what people think about.

actively engage with media based on their preferences
and previously held beliefs.

¢ Dependency Theory recognizes factors that prevent
media from exercising arbitrary control.

° Spiral of Silence Theory explains how people modify
their views to avoid isolation, and it emphasizes the
importance of free expression.

° Diffusion of Innovation Theory focuses on the com-
munication process for new ideas.

Normative Theories of Mass Media

e Authoritarian Theory advocates media subordination
to state power and ruling class interests, often involving
advance censorship and punishment for deviation.

Free Press Theory, also called Libertarian Theory,
is based on the principle of individual freedom of
expression.

° Social Responsibility Theory suggests that the free
market fails to fulfill certain societal obligations, and the
media should serve information, social, and moral needs.

¢Communist Media Theory envisions media under
the control of the working class, ruling out private
ownership.

¢ Development Communication Theory emphasizes
the use of communication for development tasks in line
with national policy.

° Democratic-Participant Media Theory supports
decentralized, small-scale, and horizontally structured
media over centralized, state-controlled, and highly
professionalized media.

Mass Society Theory

° This emphasizes the interdependence of institutions
exercising power in society.

° Suggests that mass media are integrated into the sources
of social power and authority.

¢ Views media as both the cause and maintainer of mass
society.

Political Economic Media Theory

¢ This is linked to Marxist theory.
° Focuses on the economic structure of the media rather
than its ideological content.

Hegemony Theory

¢ This focus less on the economic system and more on
ideology.

¢ Highlights the degree of independence of ideology from
the economic base.

pact of Mass Media on Society

Denis McQuail’s perspective on mass media and society:
He proposed that mass media play a dual role as both
shapers and reflectors of society.

The impact of mass media should be understood in the
context of a tradition-bound social structure.

Bernard Beralson and Monis Janowitz’s perspective on
the effects of communication: They describe the effects
as diverse, encompassing short-term and long-term,
manifest and latent, strong and weak, and covering var-
ous aspects of communication content. These effects
can be psychological, political, economic, or sociologi-
cal, and they influence opinions, values, information
evels, skills, taste, and behavior.

The growth of mass communication has made it pos-
ible to access more information than ever before, and
nformation has become a valuable commodity in a
omplex society.

Mass media are not only sources of entertainment but
ulso providers of information, recognizing and catering
0 people’s information needs.

Mass communication channels include print journal-

Group ComMuNICATION

There are many cultural concepts discussed here, they
are considered as part of group communication because
they can have a significant impact on how groups interact

and communicate. The main aspects have been discussed
below:

° Commonality and Diversity: People belong to vari-
ous groups simultaneously, such as those based on
educational, professional, economic, and religious
affiliations, each with unique characteristics. A group of
people from different cultures may have different com-
munication styles.

° Group Characteristics: Groups vary in terms of

dependence, acceptance, attraction, volition, innate
membership, pressure, change, flexibility, and lead-
ership. Group members from different cultures may
also have different values and beliefs.
For example, people from individualistic cultures
may place a high value on self-expression, while peo-
ple from collectivistic cultures may place a high value
on group harmony. This can lead to conflict if group
members do not understand and respect each other's
values and beliefs.

LeapersHip Ro.es in Group CommuNIcATION

Leadership can be considered as the part of group commu-
nication. Leadership is the process of influencing others to
achieve a common goal. It is a complex and multifaceted
activity that can be carried out in a variety of ways.

There are two main types of leadership roles:

° Task-oriented Roles: These roles focus on complet-
ing the task at hand. They involve initiating discus-
sion, giving and receiving information, elaborating and
clarifying, orienting and summarizing, and testing for
consensus.

° Maintenance Roles: These roles focus on maintaining

the group and its members. They involve compromis-
ing, supporting and encouraging, gatekeeping, stand-
ard-setting and testing.

Leadership Types: Leadership can be democratic,
authoritarian, or laissez-faire.

(a) Democratic Leadership: This involves the leader
consulting with group members and seeking their
input before making decisions. It is a collaborative
and inclusive approach that can lead to better deci-
sion-making and increased group commitment.

(b) Authoritarian Leadership: This involves the leader

~ making decisions without consulting with group
members. It is a top-down approach that can be effec-
tive in situations where quick decisions need to be
made or where there is a need for a clear direction.

However, it can also lead to resentment and frustra-

tion among group members if it is not used judiciously.

(c) Laissez-faire Leadership: The leader provides little
or no guidance to group members. It is a hands-off
approach that can be effective with creative and com-
mitted people who are able to self-manage. However,
it can also lead to chaos and disorganization if it is not
used carefully.

e Group Dynamics: Interaction within a group
is influenced by factors like age, gender, educa-
tion, and various societal, linguistic, and cultural
differences.

e Group Size and Efficiency: An optimal group size
typically ranges from 5 to 7 members for effective
interaction and information sharing.

e Committees and Conferences: Groups can func-
tion through committees (small, specific-purpose
groups) or conferences (larger, more formal
gatherings).

e Effective Communication: Group communication
is considered effective as it facilitates direct interac-
tion among members, contributing to attitude and
belief changes.

e Primary and Secondary Groups: Group classifica-
tion is divided into primary groups, characterized
by intimate, personal relations and face-to-face
interaction, and secondary groups, featuring for-
mal, impersonal, and status-based relationships.

Some Specific Communication Barriers in Groups:
Though the main types of barriers have been discussed
separately. Group members from different cultures may
also have different communication barriers. For example,
people from different cultures may have different lan-
guages, accents, and non-verbal communication styles.
This can make it difficult for group members to under-
stand each other and communicate effectively. In general,
the main barriers to group communication are as follows:

e Ethnocentrism: The belief that one’s own culture is
superior to all others. Someone from USA claiming that
American culture is the best culture in the world. We in
India claims ourselves as Jagat Guru.

» Stereotyping: Generalizations about groups of people

that are often oversimplified and inaccurate. For exam.
ple, all people from China are good at math.

° Prejudice: There may be negative attitudes or feelings
towards a group of people based on stereotypes. For
example, a teacher may have the feeling that a student
from rural background (or even) gender are naughty.

e Discrimination: Unequal treatment of a group of peo.
ple based on stereotypes or prejudice. For example, an
immigrant may be denied as job as s/he is from other
country or race. ‘White man’s burden’ is a classic exam-
ple of discrimination when Europeans colonized other
parts of the world.

The Strategies to Deal with such Communication
Barriers

e Assimilation: This means adopting the cultural values,
beliefs, and behaviours of the ‘dominant culture’. How-
ever, it can also lead to the loss of one’s own cultural
identity.

e Accommodation: This means adapting one’s commu-
nication style and behaviour to the ‘other culture’. This
can be difficult and time-consuming to adapt a new
culture.

° Separation: This means maintaining one’s own cul-
tural identity and avoiding contact with the dominant
culture. This preserves own cultural heritage. However,
it can also lead to isolation and marginalization.

Important Aspects of Group Communication: These
technical aspects are related with group communication,

e Group Cohesion: The degree to which members of a
group are united and feel a sense of belonging to the
group.

¢ Group Norms: The shared beliefs and expectations of
group members about how they should behave in the
group. _

e Group Roles: The different roles that group members
play within the group, such as leader, facilitator, and
recorder.

e Group Dynamics: The processes and interactions that
occur within a group.

¢ Groupthink: A psychological phenomenon that occurs
when a group makes a decision that is irrational or
flawed because the group members are afraid to dissent
or challenge the group’s consensus.

° Social loafing: The tendency for individuals to put in
less effort when working in a group than when working
alone.

Grapevine Communication: This is actually informal
communication. This is a type of informal communica-
tion that occurs within groups. It is based on word-of-
mouth and personal relationships, thus sometimes it
becomes notorious for its speed and accuracy, this com-
munication can be used to spread information quickly,
but it has the risk of spreading rumours and gossip. This
term originated during World War II.



=== Page 21 ===
The four types of grapevine communication are as
‘ollows:

, Single strand chain: This is the simplest type of grape-
_yine communication - where one person telling the
jnformation to another person, who then tells it to
another person, and so on.

, Gossip chain: In addition to single strand chain, this
involves the information being told to multiple people
_at once.

probability chain: This is less structured, and it involves
the information being spread to whoever is willing to
listen.

Cluster chain: This is the most complex, that involves
the information being spread to a select group of people.

or example, if a manager wants to announce a new com-

pany policy, they can use the grapevine to spread the word

to all employees quickly, but any negative grapevine such

company going bankrupt can make people anxious and
ring down group morale and productivity.

ErHNOCENTRISM VERSUS CuLTURAL RELATIVISM

Ethnocentrism is the belief that one’s own culture is supe-
rior and serves as the primary standard for evaluating
other cultures. It often leads to the judgment of other cul.
tures based on one’s own cultural norms.

_ Cultural relativism, on the other hand, acknowledges
the equal validity of all cultures and suggests that it’s
inappropriate to impose one’s own cultural values on oth-
ers. This perspective encompasses a wide range of human
teractions, beliefs, values, and practices.

Political leanings can influence these viewpoints, with
onservatives often leaning toward ethnocentrism, and
iberals tending to embrace cultural relativism. However,
many people fall between these two extremes, recogniz-
ng the need to transition from ethnocentrism to a more
‘thno-relativistic perspective for a more inclusive and cul-
turally sensitive approach.

nalytical Thinking vs. Holistic Thinking

nalytical Thinking

1. This focuses on specific details and objects in the
foreground.

2. Emphasizes cause-and-effect relationships.

- Attributes success, like getting good marks, to indi-
vidual effort and hard work.

olistic Thinking

- This considers the interdependent relationships
between various elements.

2. Takes into account broader factors, such as the envi-
ronment and parental support.

- Associates success, like achieving good marks, with
a combination of individual effort, a supportive envi-
ronment, and external factors.

4. Holistic thinkers often embrace ambiguity and accept
that things can change over time.

High-context Versus Low-context Culture
’ High-context Culture

1. This is common in cultures like Eastern societies.

2. Relies on pre-existing knowledge of individuals.

3. Verbal messages can be seen as unnecessary or even
threatening. :

4. Communication is often indirect and implicit.

5. Being pleasant is important.

6. Primarily found in collectivist cultures.

Low-context Culture

1. This is mostly prevalent in Western cultures.

2. Relies on explicit, direct communication.

3. Verbal messages are considered essential for clarity.

4. Communication is typically straightforward and
explicit.

5. Being concise is valued.

6. Often seen in individualistic cultures.

Self-enhancement vs Self-effacement
Self-enhancem ent

1. This is prevelant in individualistic, low-context
cultures.

2. Focuses on promoting individual self-esteem and
self-efficacy.

3. Encourages individuals to express their abilities and
accomplishments.

4. Values self-confidence and assertiveness,

Self-effacement

1. Common in collectivistic cultures, particularly in
Eastern societies like Japan and China.

2. Emphasizes self-criticism and modesty.

3. Individuals are hesitant to discuss their own abilities.

Aims to maintain group harmony and avoid causing
offense.

Elaboration Versus Understating
Elaboration

1. This is preferred by cultures like the French, Arabs,
Latin Americans, and Africans.

2. Involves a style of communication that includes ver-
bal exaggeration.

3. Over-assertion, exemplified by practices in Saudi
Arabia.

Understating

1. This is commonly practiced in cultures such as Chinese.

2. Utilizes silence, pauses, and understatements in
conversations.

3. Silence is used as an initial reaction in conflicts,
allowing time for emotional calm and better conflict
management strategies.

The Ways to improve intercultural communication:

1. Self-awareness and monitoring of one’s words and
actions.

2. Avoiding assumptions to avoid to prevent misunder-
standings, conflict, and discrimination.

3. Practicing transpection - the process of trying to
understand and empathize with people from differ-
ent cultures.

4. Gaining knowledge about different cultures.

5. Gaining experience in cross-cultural interactions.

The Internet serves as a platform for seeking common
values, understandings, and approaches to navigating a
world of diverse cultures.

Classroom Communication _
Process—Cole and Chan Mode

The Cole and Chan Model of Classroom Communication

outlines the essential aspects of teaching and learning |

within the classroom environment, this also focus upon
on the effective transfer of knowledge and cognitive
development. This model identifies five crucial stages in
the communication process:

FORMULATION OF IVIESSAGE

Formulating a message is a critical step in the commu-
nication process, influencing both the message and its

reception. For example,the teacher prepares and organ- |

izes the information to be conveyed in a clear and struc-
tured manner.

Several key points highlight the importance of this
stage:

1. Medium shapes the message: The choice of

communication medium, such as verbal, writ-
ten, nonverbal, or visual, can significantly impact
the message’s. sender, audience, and effects. It is
important to consider the medium when formulat-

ing a message to ensure that it is communicated |

effectively.

decide.

Figure 4



=== Page 23 ===
Message originates from an idea: Every com-
munication begins with an idea or message that
the sender wants to transmit to the audience. The
sender may want to inform, persuade, or entertain
the audience.

Nature of the message: Messages can be verbal
or nonverbal. Verbal messages are communicated
through spoken or written words. Nonverbal mes-
sages are communicated through body language,
facial expressions, and tone of voice.

Attributes of an effective communicator: Effective
- communicators have certain attributes, such as
the ability to think quickly, organize thoughts, and
express themselves clearly. They are also able to
adapt their communication style to the audience and
situation.

Teacher’s role in message formulation: Educators
play a vital role in formulating messages for students.
They need to conceptualize ideas, arrange them
coherently, and consider the curriculum content to
ensure that their communication is meaningful and
organized.

e audience, purpose, tone ( formal, informal, friendly,
or serious) and style (direct or indirect) are important to

Message Encoding
aoice of Message encoding is a crucial step in the communica-
al, writ- on process, involving the transformation of ideas into a
y impact form that can be effectively transmitted. For example, the
cts. It is teacher translates their knowledge into a format suitable

for teaching, ensuring clarity and understanding.
Several key points emphasize the importance of mes-
Sage encoding:

ormulat-
unicated

4.23

1. Message Formulation: Before encoding, there is an
internal process of shaping, sorting, and clarifying
ideas. The goal of this formulation is to create a clear
and meaningful message, ensuring that the intended
message is well-structured.

2. Conversion of Ideas: Encoding is the process of con-
verting these formulated ideas into a format suitable
for transmission to receivers. It involves translating
thoughts, information, or intentions into a communi-
cable form.

‘3. Choice of Medium: The communicator not only cre-
ates the message but also selects the medium for its
delivery. This decision includes choosing whether to
communicate through speech, writing, signaling, or
gestures.

4. Consideration of Receiver: Effective encoding
requires the communicator to consider the abilities
and preferences of the receiver. The choice of media
should be based on what the recipient can compre-
hend best. For instance, using written communication
may not be suitable for an illiterate audience, making
oral communication a more effective choice.
Role of Teachers: In educational settings, teachers
encode their ideas differently depending on the
curriculum requirements. They are responsible
for using appropriate symbolic forms for each sub-
ject and teaching students how to use these forms
effectively.

y

Message Transmission

Message transmission is a crucial step in communication;
and it’s all about how the message is sent. For example,
The teacher delivers the message using various methods,
aiming for effective communication.

Here’s what you need to know:

1. Choosing the Right Way: At this stage, the sender
decides on the best method to deliver their message.
This means selecting the right channel or way of pre-
senting the message.

2. What’s a Channel: A ‘channel’ is like the delivery
truck for your message. It’s how your message gets
from you to the other person. There are many options,
like speaking, writing, using body language, or even
mass media like TV. Teachers, for example, might use
films or hands-on demonstrations to teach the same
thing. They can use different channels to make sure
everyone understands.

1. Understanding these points helps make sure your
message gets across effectively by choosing the
right delivery method.

Messace DecopinG AND INTERPRETATION

Message decoding and interpretation involve the receiver
making sense of the message sent by the communicator,
For example, students receive and decode the message,
actively engaging with the content to understand the
intended meaning.



=== Page 24 ===
4.24

Here are the key points:

1. Active Interpretation: Decoding isn’t a passive pro-
cess. The receiver actively interprets the message
based on their background knowledge and the com-
munication context. Language itself doesn’t have
meaning; it’s the decoder who gives it meaning.

2. Background Knowledge: Having relevant back-
ground information and familiarity with the language
used makes decoding and understanding the message
easier.

3. Listening, Reading, and Thinking: The receiver’s
ability to listen, read, and think is crucial for effective
decoding. Without these skills, they won’t be able to
receive and interpret messages as intended.

4. Receiver’s Significance: In the communication pro-
cess, the receiver plays a vital role. Effective commu-
nication relies on the receiver’s ability to accurately
decode and interpret the message.

Feedback and Evaluation

Feedback and evaluation are essential aspects of the com-
munication process. For example, students provide feed-
back, enabling the teacher to assess the effectiveness of
communication and make necessary adjustments.

The key points are as follows:

1. Feedback Definition: Feedback is the response or
acknowledgment provided by the receiver to the com-
municator’s message. It’s a critical part of the commu-
nication process and is often considered a motor func-
tion. :

2. Receiver’s Reaction: It involves the receiver react-
ing to the messages they receive and conveying their
response back to the sender.

3. Adapting Messages: Effective communicators
encourage feedback and use it to adjust the content
and presentation of their messages. Feedback helps in
refining communication.

4. Teacher-Student Dynamics: Teachers should be
attuned to the various ways students convey reactions
to messages. Skilled teachers can control feedback to
enhance the ongoing communication process without
unnecessary interference.

5. Non-Verbal Feedback: Feedback can be conveyed
through non-verbal cues like facial expressions,
gestures, or seeking clarification. This continuous
interaction between the communicator and receiver
shapes and refines the message.

6. Evaluation: Feedback offers an opportunity to evalu-
ate the effectiveness of a communication. It helps in
assessing what works and what doesn’t, facilitating
the improvement of the message.

7. Interactive Model in Classroom: In the classroom
setting, feedback plays a significant role in the inter-
action between teachers and students. This dynamic
model involves constant role changes and bidirec-
tional communication.

Effective feedback and evaluation are crucial for refining
and enhancing the quality of communication.

Noise

Noise can significantly disrupt effective communication
Here are important points about noise in communication:

1. Definition: Noise is any interruption or interfereng
that can occur at any stage of the communication pro
cess, rendering it ineffective.

2. Environmental Noise: External factors in the enyj
ronment, like traffic noise, loudspeakers, or back.
ground chatter, can disrupt message reception. Poorly
lit rooms can also contribute to environmental noise,

3. Other Forms of Noise: Noise isn’t limited to exter.
nal factors. Poor handwriting, strong accents, or
soft speech can also act as barriers to effective
communication.

Categories of Noise

® Physiological Noise: Distractions caused by physic
factors like hunger, fatigue, illness, or medication.

° Physical Noise: Direct interference from the physical
environment, such as traffic noise, inadequate lighting,
and other external factors.

Psychological Noise: Internal factors like preoccu-
pation with personal issues, prejudice, or defensive-
ness that affect how individuals interpret and convey.
messages.

Semantic Noise: Occurs when words themselves are
not mutually understood, such as when technical jargon
or unclear language is used.

To ensure smooth and effective communication, it is cru-.
cial to identify and reduce or eliminate noise as much as
possible. Noise can hinder the clarity and understanding
of messages, making it essential to address and minimize _
its impact.

cIPLES OF ErrectiveE CLASSROOM

MUNICATION

jveness of classroom communication depends on five
‘actors, namely teacher, student, message, instruc-

methods and media, and learning environment.

e principles of effective classroom communication

peen discussed under the following four headings:

rinciples for selection of instructional methods and
media — . . .

principles for creating conducive learning
environment

ciples for Teachers

effective classroom communication, teachers should
sess the following qualities:

ton. Develop a realistic self-concept and a perception of
their surroundings.

Develop proficiency in the subject matter - ‘Live as if
you were to die tomorrow; Learn as if you were to live
forever’.

Understanding of the learners, considering their indi-
_ vidual characteristics and learning styles.

_ Effective communication skills, both verbal and
non-verbal.

_ Knowledge about pedagogy and andragogy for sound
_ teaching and learning principles.

Adopt a flexible approach to modify instructions
based on student needs.

Maintain objectivity and impartiality by treating all
students equally without bias.

inciples For Message Design

effective message design in classroom communica-
on, consider the following characteristics:

Clear and specified objectives that are SMART (Spe-
cific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-framed).
Content should be relevant to the defined objectives.
Proper sequencing of content, moving from simple to
complex, easy to difficult, concrete to abstract, known
to unknown, and from observation to reasoning.

Use simple and comprehensible language that stu-
dents can understand, avoiding technical jargon.
Employ appropriate and standardized symbols.
Include relevant exercises of varying difficulty levels
to engage learners.

Utilize examples and non-examples from everyday
life and the working world to demonstrate the appli-
cability of content in different contexts and enhance
transferability.

inciples For Selection of Instructional Methods
and Media

When selecting instructional methods-and media for
effective classroom communication, consider the follow-

4.25

1. Choose methods and media that are relevant to the
objectives, content, and context, and appropriate for
the learners’ level.

2. Use a variety of methods and media to address indi-
vidual differences among learners and prevent
monotony.

3. Assess the quality of media, considering visibility, leg-
ibility, finish, colour, and printing.

4. Integrate media into teaching and learning, ensuring
it is not used in isolation. For instance, follow up the
use of media with discussions or quick assessments to
reinforce understanding.

Principles For Creating Conducive Learning
Environment

When creating a conducive learning environment, con-
sider the following principles:

1. Avoid overcrowded classes to allow for individual
attention to each student.

2. Ensure proper seating arrangements for optimal

classroom ambiance, lighting, and ventilation.

Establish a positive rapport between the teacher and

students, respecting their individuality.

Encourage cooperation and healthy competition

among students through group activities and pairing

students with varying abilities.

5. Implement a feedback mechanism that allows for
communication between teachers and students.

6. Promote experimentation and innovation in the
classroom.

7. Provide reinforcement for desired communica-
tion behaviors through praise, rewards, and social
recognition.

8. Create a non-threatening environment, ensuring stu-
dents are informed about schedules and expectations
to reduce anxiety.

the audience at their convenience and doesn’t require
simultaneous presence, such as printed materials or
recorded audio or video.

Examples are the following:

1. Printed Materials: Reading a book, newspaper, or
magazine at any time.

2. Recorded Audio: Listening to a podcast or pre-
recorded music.

video event for later viewing, allowing the audi-
ence to watch it at a different time than the original
broadcast.

4, Surveillance: The core function of mass communica-
tion, involving the dissemination of information about
societal processes, issues, events, and developments.

5, Convergence: The integration of computing, tele-
communications, and media in a digital environment,
leading to significant changes in mass media and
communication.

Six Different Types of Interpersonal Power of
Communication

These are six different types of interpersonal power in
communication, often observed in leadership positions
like teaching:

1. Expert Power: Based on possessing valuable, unique
knowledge.

2, Referent Power: Derived from empathizing and
relating to others’ thoughts and feelings.

3, Information Power: Involves presenting information
logically and coherently.

4, Legitimate Power: Comes from formal titles like
CEO, parent, or teacher.

5, Reward Power: Encourages compliance through
offering tangible rewards.

6. Coercive Power: Enforces compliance by using pun-
ishment for noncompliance.

Barriers can completely prevent communication, filter
some of it, or distort its meaning. Communication doesn’t
break down but transforms; for example, ignoring some-
one communicates a desire not to talk.

tion by making people react based on preconceived
» Notions.

Linguistic Anb CutruraL Barriers IN
COMMUNICATION

1. Semantic Barriers: These occur when people from
different cultures or languages disagree on the mean-
ings of words, making it difficult to establish a com-
mon understanding. It’s particularly common when
individuals speak different languages.

High-context and Low-context Cultures: High-
context cultures rely heavily on non-verbal cues and
shared situational understanding to communicate,
while low-context cultures use explicit verbal com-
munication. Understanding these cultural differences
is crucial for effective communication.
Cross-cultural Communication: This field of study
examines how people from diverse cultural back-
grounds communicate both similarly and differently.
It explores the strategies and challenges of communi-
cation across cultures.

MECHANICAL BARRIERS

Mechanical barriers in communication, found in both
interpersonal and mass communication, can hinder the
message’s smooth transmission:



=== Page 28 ===
4.28

e Nature of Mechanical Barriers: These barriers can
lead to difficulties in receiving a message, resulting in
either partial message loss or distortion. They may stem
from issues with communication facilities.

e Channel Noise: This term describes disturbances in
the physical transmission of messages, such as radio
disruptions, TV screen blurriness, ink smudging in
print media, inaudibility in telephone calls, or device
malfunctions.

e Cultural and Social Factors: Mechanical barriers are
not solely technical; they can also be influenced by cul-
tural, social, and language factors, customs, beliefs,
motives, or even illiteracy.

In workplace communication, several barriers can affect
effective communication:

1. Language Barrier: The same message may be inter-
preted differently by different individuals due to vari-
ations in language comprehension, vocabulary, and
dialects.

2. Perceptual Biases: Perceptual biases, including ste-
reotyping, projection, and self-fulfilling prophecies,
can distort how people perceive and understand
messages. Stereotyping involves assuming that indi-
viduals from a particular group possess specific traits,
even when this may not be the case.

3. Impersonal Relationships: Prior experiences with
a communicator can influence how individuals
perceive messages. Communication from a higher
authority may be perceived differently than commu-
nication from a colleague or subordinate.

4, Cultural Differences: Effective communication
requires an understanding of the fundamental

motives, values, assumptions, and aspirations operat-.

ing within different cultures. These cultural variations
can impact how messages are conveyed and received,
necessitating cultural sensitivity in communication
practices.

ORGANIZATIONAL BARRIERS

Organizational barriers in communication arise as organ-
izations develop and can be attributed to various condi-
tions:

1. Size of the Organization: Larger organizations tend
to face more communication challenges due to their
scale and complexity.

2, Physical Distance Between Employees:
Geographically dispersed teams or remote work
arrangements can hinder effective communication.

3. Specialization of Jobs and Activities: Highly spe-
cialized roles may lead to jargon and difficulties in
conveying information across functions.

4, Organizational Culture: The culture within an
organization greatly impacts the freedom and trust
among employees and, consequently, the flow of
communication.

5. Organizational Rules and Regulations: Strict poli.
cies and procedures may create bureaucratic obstg_
cles that impede open communication.

6. Power Structure: The hierarchy and power dynamicg
- in an organization can affect how freely information
flows between different levels of employees.

7. Complexity in Organizational Structure: A complex
organizational structure with numerous departments
and reporting lines can introduce layers that hinder
communication.

8. Inadequate Facilities and Opportunities: A lack of
appropriate communication tools or spaces for inter.
action can act as barriers.

9, Lack of Cooperation Between Seniors and
Subordinates: A lack of cooperation between leaders
and their teams can stifle effective communication
and create mistrust

PuysicaL BARRIERS

The geographic distance between the sender and
receiver(s) can be taken as the most pertinent example of
physical barrier in communication.

Four Types of Powers in Communication

1. Expressing Yourself: Communication begins from.
the moment we enter the world. It involves conveying."
your thoughts, ideas, and emotions effectively.

2, Listening and Responding: Effective communica-
tion is a two-way process. Actively listening to others
and providing thoughtful responses is a crucial power

_ in communication.

3. Regulating Attention and Intention: Emotional
intelligence plays a significant role in communic
tion. Understanding and controlling your emotional
responses and intentions canimprove communication.

4. Understanding and Responding to People in Their |
‘Style’: Recognizing that people have different com-
munication styles and adapting your approach to
suit their preferences enhances the effectiveness of
communication.

Physical Barriers in Communication

1. Competing Stimulus: Other distractions, such as.
background conversations or traffic noise, can com-
pete with the message being conveyed, making it
challenging to focus on the communication.

2. Environmental Stress: Uncomfortable environmen-
tal conditions like high temperatures or poor ventila-
tion can disrupt communication.

3. Subjective Stress: Personal factors like sleeplessness,
illness, drug effects, and mood swings can affect one’s
ability to engage in effective communication.

4, Receiver’s Unfamiliarity with Medium: When the
recipient is not familiar with the communication
medium being used, it can act as a barrier to under- «
standing and effective interaction.

itrict ow TO Overcome BARRIERS IN
HC obs MUNICATION

overcome barriers in communication, supervisors and
< yng nagers should take the following steps:
ormat :

Regulate the Flow of Information: Ensure that
Acom jnformation flows smoothly and is not impeded by
oartme “umnecessary obstacles.

Feedback: Encourage feedback to confirm that the
message was received and understood as intended.
Use Simple Language: Communicate in a clear and
straightforward manner, using language that is easily
understood. :

Consider the Recipient’s Level of Knowledge:
Tailor your communication to the recipient’s level of
knowledge, educational qualifications, and fluency in
their language. Whenever possible, use the recipient’s
mother tongue.

_ Listen Carefully: Actively listen to what others are
saying. Be patient, ask questions for clarification,
eliminate distractions, and focus entirely on the
speaker.

Control Emotions: Emotions such as anger or frus-
tration can distort the message. It’s best to postpone
communication until emotions are under control.
Observe Non-verbal Cues or Body Language: Pay
attention to non-verbal cues and body language dur-
ing oral communication to ensure that the message
aligns with the receiver’s understanding.

OMMUNICATIONS THROUGH EMOTICONS

moticons are visual representations of emotions in writ-
n communication. They are used to convey feelings and
pressions and are often seen in computer-related con-
versations.

Key points about emoticons:

Origin: The term ‘emoticon’ is derived from a com-
bination of ‘emotion’ and ‘icon.’ The first emoticons,
like the smiley face (:-)) and frowny face :-(, were cre-
ated by Scott E. Fahlman in 1982 to indicate humour
in computer systems.

. Functions: Emoticons serve several functions, such as
conveying a positive attitude, adding humour or indi-
cating irony, and softening or strengthening speech
acts in written interaction.

Difference from Emoji: Emoticons are created using
ASCII symbols, while emojis are pictographs repre-
senting faces, objects, and symbols. Emojis are a more
recent invention.

. Usage: Emoticons are commonly used in chat soft-
ware, and they help supplement and organize inter-
personal written communication. They are often
used to convey emotions and tone that might be
missing in text.

. Studies: Research on emoticons has shown that they
are used more frequently by women, and their use can
vary based on the context of the communication.

4.28

Emoticons are considered semiotic resources in written
communication, allowing individuals to modify speech,
provide context to discourse, and enhance social relation-
ships through text-based conversations.

SPEECH ACT AND POLITENESS THEORY

Speech act theory and politeness theory are two impor-
tant concepts in linguistics, and they help us understand
different aspects of language and communication.

Key points about these theories:

1. Speech Act Theory:

e Speech act theory deals with the idea that speaking
is not just conveying information but also perform-
ing actions. It distinguishes between constatives
(descriptive statements that can be true or false)
and performatives (utterances that realize a social
action).

e Utterances have three acts: locutionary (making
a meaningful utterance), illocutionary (making
requests, offers, jokes, promises), and perlocution-
ary (the effect on the audience).

e There are five main categories of speech acts: Direc-
tives (requests), Expressives (thanking), Repre-
sentatives (assertions), Commissives (promises),
and Declarations (appointments).

2. Politeness Theory:

° Politeness theory, developed by Penelope Brown
and Stephen C. Levinson, is concerned with behav-
ing in a socially acceptable manner with proper
manners and etiquette.

e Hedging is a key aspect of politeness theory.
Hedges are expressions that modify the speech
act rather than the logical form of the utterance.
They can be strengtheners (emphasizing the con-
tent) or softeners (softening the content) and
indicate the speaker’s commitment to what they
are saying.

These theories help us understand not only the linguistic
aspects of communication but also the social and cultural
dimensions, including how language is used to perform
various acts and maintain politeness in interactions.

OBJECTIVES

5.2

Reasoning, one of the highest orders of thinking, is
the stepwise thinking and mental recognition of cause
and effect relationships. It involves productive think-
ing in which insight and past experiences are required.
Reasoning is a factor of intelligence. It is a procéss in
which pre-knowledge, experiences, insight and under-
standing of relationship are used to solve problems. The
ability to reason is closely related to intelligence. It goes in
the direction given to the learner, that is, it is always goal-
oriented. It is creative and reflective in nature. Reasoning
ability develops gradually. It means that experiences are
also helpful in developing reasoning power along with
intelligence. There may be more than one logic to draw
an inference—reasoning is multi-dimensional.

Numerous philosophical mathematicians and psychol-
ogists have given the following six steps for reasoning:

TYPES OF REASONING

Aristotle gave an extended, systematic treatment of the
methods of human reasoning. The three methods were
deductive, inductive and abductive reasonings (Fig. 5.1).

1. Deductive reasoning: Deductive reasoning is also
known as analytical reasoning as it deals with objects
by looking at its component parts. Formal logic has
been described as the science of deduction. The con-
cept of syllogism has been explained in Chapter 6.

2. Inductive reasoning: Inductive reasoning is also
known as ‘synthetic reasoning’ and deals with a class
of objects by looking at the common properties of
each object in the class. The study of inductive rea-
soning is generally carried out within a field known
as ‘informal logic’ or ‘critical thinking’.

3. Abductive reasoning: Abductive reasoning is con-
sidered as the third form of reasoning. It is somewhat
similar to inductive reasoning. It takes its clues from
the term ‘guessing’, since conclusions drawn here are

based on probabilities. Here, it is presumed that the
most plausible conclusion is also the correct one.

Figure 5.1 Reasoning and its Types
Example:

Major premise: The container is filled with yellow peb-
bles.

Minor premise: Bobby has a yellow pebble in his hand.

Conclusion: The yellow pebble in Bobby’s hand was
taken out of the container.

By abductive reasoning, the possibility that Bobby
took the yellow pebble from the container. is reason-
able, though it is purely based on speculation. Anyone
could have given the yellow pebble to Bobby, or prob-
ably Bobby could have bought a yellow pebble at a retail
store. Therefore, abducing that Bobby took the yellow
pebble, from the observation of ‘the yellow pebble—filled
container’, may lead to a false conclusion. Unlike deduc-
tive and inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning is not
commonly used for psychometric testing.
Here, we can discuss other forms of reasoning as well.

HypPoTHETICAL Sy.Locism (Mopus Ponens)

A syllogism is simply a three-line argument that consists
of exactly two premises and a conclusion. A hypothetical
syllogism is a syllogism that includes at least one hypo-
thetical or conditional (if-then) premise. This is why
such type of deductive reasoning is also known as condi-
tional reasoning. This pattern of reasoning is also known
as modus ponens. The four varieties of modus ponens are
as follows.

Chain Argument

Chain arguments consist of three conditional statements
that are linked together. Here is an example of a chain
argument.

If I do not appear in the exam, then I will fail in
graduation.

If I fail in graduation, then I will lose my time and
money.

Therefore, if I do not appear in exam, I will lose my
time and money.

Modus Toliens

Here is
These are sometimes called ‘denying the consequences’ Here, |
because they consist of one conditional premise, a second or entire

premise that denies (asserts to be false) the consequences



=== Page 33 ===
he conditional and a conclusion that denies to be the
ecedent of the conditional. Here is an example of
dus tollens argument.

¢ we are in Manchester, then we are in Gujarat.

We are not in Gujarat.

Therefore, we are not in Manchester.

nying the Antecedent Argument

uch arguments, the first premise denies (i.e. asserts to
alse) the antecedent of the conditional and a conclu-
denies the consequent of the conditional.

Here is an example. ;

f we are in Chandigarh, then we are in the North.

We are not in Chandigarh.

Therefore, we are not in the North.

We can notice that the premises in the above—men-
oned examples are true and the conclusion is false.
he pattern of reasoning of this argument is not logically
and.

is pattern of reasoning is also faulty and affirms the
nsequent.

For example, if we are on Venus, then we are in the
lar system.

‘We are in the solar system.

Therefore, we are on Venus.

Such pattern of reasoning has true premises and a false
nclusion; it is clear that affirming the consequent is not
gically reliable.

ATEGORICAL SYLLOGISM

ey have been discussed in Unit 6 also. Here, the state-
nts of the premises begin typically with ‘all’, ‘none’
‘some’, and the conclusion starts with ‘therefore’ or

well.

Argument from Definition

ns are

an argument from definition, the conclusion is pre-
nted as being true by definition.

Nand is a cardiologist. Therefore, Nand is a doctor.

A straightforward relationship between the cardiolo-
st and the doctor (two elements) is observed here. The
nclusion of valid deductive reasoning contains no more

formation than the premise.
ments

chain | Argument by Elimination

An argument by elimination seeks to logically rule out vari-
Ous possibilities until only a single possibility remains. It is
like attempting questions in an examination.

‘ail in
e and
se my Argument Based on Mathematics
The main aim of mathematics is to develop the reasoning
ower of humanity.

Here is an example.

Here, the conclusion is claimed to depend largely
¢ entirely on some mathematical calculation or

ances’
acond
ences

measurement (perhaps in conjunction with one or more
non-mathematical premises).

Twelve is greater than eight.

Eight is greater than four.

Therefore, twelve is greater than four.

Let us discuss the inductive reasoning in more detail.
The statement or proposition is based on general
observations and experiences; such reasoning is called
inductive reasoning. There is a strong contrast with
deductive reasoning. Even in the strongest cases of
inductive reasoning, the truth of the premises does not
guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Rather, the con-
clusion of an inductive argument follows some degree
of probability. There may be more information in the
conclusion of an inductive reasoning than that already
contained in the premises. Thus, this method of reason-
ing is applicative.

In inductive reasoning, a statement in one particu-
lar case will be true in all other cases in the same serial
order. It may be applied generally to all such cases. Here,
one can formulate a generalized statement or principle
and conclusions on the basis of certain facts and specific
examples.

Once we have discussed inductive reasoning, we
can now discuss six common patterns of inductive
reasoning:

1. Inductive generalization: It is an argument in which
a generalization is claimed to be probably true based
on the information about some members of a class. All
inductive generalizations claim that their conclusions
are probable rather than certain.

2. Predictive argument: It is a statement about what
may or will happen in the future; here a prediction is
defended with reasons. It is among the most common
patterns of inductive reasoning. Here is an example: It
has rained in Mumbai every June since weather records
have been maintained. Therefore, it will probably rain
in Mumbai next June.

Nothing in the future is absolutely certain; argu-
ments containing predictions are usually inductive.

3. Argument from authority: The conclusion is sup-
ported by presumed authority or witness who has
said that the conclusion is true. We can never be abso-
lutely certain that a presumed authority or witness is
accurate or reliable.

4. Causal argument: One of the most basic, most com-
mon and most important kinds of knowledge we seek
is the knowledge of cause and effect. A causal argu-
ment asserts or denies that something is the cause of
something else. :

5. Statistical argument: A statistical argument rests
on statistical evidence, that is, evidence that some
percentage of some group has some particular
characteristics.

6. Argument from analogy: An analogy is a compari-
son of two or more things that are claimed to be alike
in some relevant respect.

Towards the end, we can say that inductive reasoning is
informative because the conclusion of an inductive rea-
soning contains more information than is already con-
tained in the premises.

Other Reasoning Types

We are using verbal and non-verbal symbols to communi-
cate with others. There are five types of reasoning, which
are explained as follows:

1. Verbal reasoning: Normally, we communicate with
others by language, and the language is a vehicle for
reasoning. So reasoning without language or words
and symbols is not possible. In verbal reasoning, we
use linguistic symbols such as words. Some verbal
reasoning ability tests are available.

2. Non-verbal reasoning: In competitive examinations,
we observe that a part of the written paper consists of
reasoning, containing ome figures, graphs and draw-
ings which can measure the non-verbal reasoning
ability of the contestant.

3. Reasoning as propositions: It is often difficult to
determine whether a long and complex argument is
valid or invalid just by reading. The logical process of
analysis of the parts of whole arguments and symbol-
izing them to determine the validity of arguments is
known as propositional reasoning.

Here is an example.
Ifa=4,b=7,a+c=b, thenc=?
4+c=7.

Therefore, c= 3.

4. Automated reasoning: It is basically an area of com-
puter science. It understands different aspects of rea-
soning to allow the creation of computer software to
reason completely or almost completely automati-
cally. Sometimes, it is usually considered a subfield
of artificial intelligence, but it also has strong con-
nections to theoretical computer science and even
philosophy.

5. Brain’s centre of reasoning: The left hemisphere
is dominant for most people; it controls written and
spoken languages and mathematical calculations.
The prefrontal cortex is the farthest forward area in
the brain and is an associated area of the frontal lobe.
The left hemisphere of the brain is said to be analyti-
cal, logical, mathematical and concerned with cause
and effect related to scientific thinking.

A series may consist of a number series or a letter series.
There are several such series, such as finding the missing
numbers, replacing the wrong numbers, finding the miss-
ing letters and finding the wrong group of numbers or let-
ters, to name a few.

LetTerR Series

In this type of problem, a series of letters of the English
alphabet will be given which follow a pattern or a
sequence. The letter series mainly consists of skipping the
letters.

To solve these types of problems, assign numbers
1-26 to the letters of English alphabet as shown below.
In some cases, it is useful to assign the numbers in a
reverse order.

Concept of ‘EJOTY’
letters E J 0
Position 5 10 15 20 25

The candidates can determine the relative positions of
various alphabets by just remembering the word ‘EJOTY’.
Various types of letter series are given as follows:

° First alphabetical half: A to M > 1-13
° Second alphabetical half: N to Z > 14-26

Tables 5.1 and 5.2 show both the forward and the
backward place values of the English alphabet. A very
important fact about the position of any letter is that the
sum of forward position and reverse position for any let-
ter is always constant and equal to 27. For example, the
sum of both positions of H is (8 + 19 = 27), and for W is
(23+ 4=27).

Example 18: 8, E, H, K,N,...

(a) P (b) O (c) Q (d)R
Solution: the series is +3. The missing letter is N+ 3 =Q.
Therefore, (c) is the correct answer.

Alternative solution: Skip two letters to get the next
letter, that is, skip O and P after N to get Q. The missing

letter is Q.
Example 19: B, D,G,1,L,N,...
(a) N (b) O (c) P (d) Q

Solution: This series is formed by moving +2 and +3 for
each pair of letters starting from left. Thus, the missing
letter is N+3=Q. :

Therefore, (d) is the correct answer.

Alternative solution: Skip one and two letters
alternately to get the next letter, that is, skip two letters O
and P after N to get Q.

Example 20: 8, C, E, G, K, ...

(a) M (b) N (c) O (d) P

Solution: B = 2, .... K = 11 according to the alphabet

The codes are based on various principles or patterns such
hat the message can be easily deciphered at the other end.
hey have become an almost regular feature of NET Paper
Exam to judge the candidates’ intelligence and mental
bilities. They are required to encode and decode words
nd sentences after observing the pattern and principles
Involved. These questions can be broadly classified into
Iphabetical coding, numerical coding and mixed coding.

LPHABETICAL CopDING

Remembering the positions of different letters is nec-
€ssary to solve any question on alphabetical series. The
English language contains 26 alphabets and their varied
Positions are discussed in Tables 5.1-5.3.

mother logic and the third letters follow some other

57

In these types of questions, the letters of the alpha-
bet are exclusively used. These letters do not stand for
themselves but are allotted some artificial values based
on some logical pattern or analogy. By applying those
principles or observing the pattern involved, the candi-
dates are required to decode a coded word or encode a
word. This can be further classified into the following
categories.

Simple Analogical Letter Coding

These are also called arbitrary codes. There are two defi- .

nite principles or patterns involved. Codes are based on

the analogy of one example from which different codes

are formed.

Example 32: If‘BELONGINGS is coded as ‘TABLESTESP’,
then how will you code ‘LINEN’? .

(a) BTEAE (b) BTAEA
(c) BATEA (d) None of these
Solution

The coding is done as follows:

L Se a a
Codes” t A BL.

Accordingly, the code for LINEN is BTEAE.
Thus, the answer is (a).

Letter Copine on Speciric Pattern

First, the candidates are required to observe the specific
pattern involved and then proceed with encoding or
decoding as the case may be.

Example 33; If ‘POSTED’ is coded as ‘DETSOP’, then how
will you code ‘SPEED’?

(a) DEEPS
(c) DESEP

(b) DEESP
(d) SPEDE

Solution: By careful observation, we can say that the
letters have been written in the reverse order. Hence,
SPEED will be written DEEPS; therefore, (a) is the correct
answer.

Example 34: If‘GREET’ is coded as ‘FQDDS’, then ‘CDDO’
stands for

(a) EDDP (b) DEEP (c) PEED (d) EPED

Solution: Here, it is —1 for each letter of the word’
‘GREET’.



=== Page 38 ===
5.8

CDDO itself is a code. To find out what it stands for, we have
to add +1 to the alphabets to get back the original word.

Code ; Cc DD. oO
+1 +1 +1 +1
Word =D Bee EP

(b) is the correct answer.
Example 35: If ‘PAT’ is coded as ‘QRBCUV,, then how will
you code ‘GRACE’?

(a) HISTBCDEFG
(c) HISBTCDEFG

(b) HISTBCDEGF
(d) HISTBCEDFG

Solution: The pattern of coding is such that each letter
has been allotted the value of two letters following the
sequence, that is, A= BC, B= CD, C=DE, etc.

Hence, the word GRACE will be coded as ‘HISTBCDEFG’.
Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.

Example 36: If ‘EGHJKMKM’ is the code for ‘FILL, then
how will you decode ‘EGDFDFKM’?

(a) LEEF (b) FEEL (c) DEAL

(d) REEL

Solution: Refer to alphabet series in Table 5.1. Starting
from the L.H.S. pair; E is the antecedent of F and G is the
precedent of F. We get EG as code for F, HJ as code for I
and so on.

Similarly, EGDFDFKM is the code for FEEL. F is coded
as EG with its precedent and antecedent letters. Similarly,
is coded as HJ and Las KM. Hence, EGDFDFKM stands
for FEEL.

Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.

Copine with Numericar Dicits

Here, the numerical values (not necessarily according to
rank of letters in the alphabet series) can be assigned to
letters. The values are allotted based on some specific pat-
tern that has to be discerned by the candidate in order to
solve the problem.

Example 37: If ‘TRAIN’ is coded as 23456, then how will
you code ‘RAIN’?
(a) 3456 (b) 3546

(c) 2345 (d) 2456

Solution:

‘Word T RA IN
Code 2 3 4 5 6
These values have been assigned arbitrarily. The question

can be solved on the basis of the relationship established.
For RAIN, the code is 3456, so (a) is the correct answer.

Analogical Coding with Numerical Digits

Here, the letters are assigned numerical values on the
basis of the analogy of the example given in the question.

There is no set of principles or patterns involved. The can.
didates are required to study the given examples before
getting started with the exercise.

Example 38: If ‘SELDOM’ is coded as ‘1 2 43 6 5’, then
how will you code ‘MODE’?

(a) 3621 (c)5632 (d)6213

(b) 6231

Solution

On the basis of the analogical relationship established
between the letters and the numbers, we can code ‘MODE’
as 5632.

Therefore, (c) is the correct answer.

Coding with Specific Pattern
This is a pattern of coding that exhibits the natural cor-
relation of Arabic numbers with alphabetical letters. For
instance, alphabets A to Z are assigned the numeric codes
from 1 to 26, where each letter gets the assignment in the
pattern as follows: A=1, B= 2, C=3, ete.

The sequence is classified as follows:

1. Forward sequence: For example, A=1,B=2,...,. Y=
25,Z=26 ,

Example 39: If ‘PACE’ is code as 16-1~3-5, then how
will you code ‘RACE’?
(a) 18-1-3-5 (b) 16-1-3-5
(c) 16-3-5-1 (d) None of the above
By referring to Table 5.1, we can say that (a) is the
correct answer.

2. Backward sequence: For example, Z=1, Y=2,...,B
=25,A=26

Example 40: If ‘GREAT’ is coded as 20-9-22-26-7, then
how will you code ‘GATE’?

(a) 20-26-7-22  (b) 20~-26-6-22

(c) 26-20—-7-22 (d) 26-20-—22-7

By referring to Table 5.2, (a) is the correct answer.

3. Random sequence: The pattern can be established in
alternative ways, but in every case, a set pattern has to
be discovered by careful examination of the example
given in the question.

Example: Sometimes, A = 3, B = 4, Z = 28 might be
given, sometimes it might be given in the form such
asA=5,B=7,C=9 and soon.

Example 41: If ‘FRANCE’ is coded as 10-22-5-18-7-9,
then how will you code ‘INDIA’? .

(a) 13-18-8-13-5

(b) 13-17-6~12-4

In a certain code language, ‘do re me’ means ‘he is
late’, ‘fa me la’ means ‘she is early’ and ‘so ti do’ means
‘he leaves soon’. Which word in that language means
‘late’?

(a) la (b) do

(c) me _ (d) re

Explanation

do re me—he is late (i)
fa me la—she is early (ii)
so tido—he leaves soon (iii)

Comparing (i) and (ii), we can say that ‘me’ stands
for ‘is’.

Comparing (i) and (iii), we can say that ‘do’ stands
for ‘he’.

Substituting them in sentence (i), we can say that ‘re’
stands for ‘late”.

The following arrangement also helps in the

4, In a certain code, ‘247’ means ‘spread red carpet’,
‘256’ means ‘dust one carpet’ and ‘236’ means ‘one red
carpet’. Which digit in that code means ‘dust’?

(a) 2 (b) 3 (c) 5 (d) 6

Explanation

In the first statement, the common code digit is ‘2’. In
the second statement, the common word is ‘carpet’.
Thus, ‘2’ means ‘carpet’. In the second and third state-
ments, the common code digit is ‘6’ and the common

To draw a family tree:

1. First of all, identify the males and the females, and
then according to generation, put each member at the
appropriate position in the tree.

2. Draw the diagram with relationships among family
members using notations.

3. Once the diagram is filled, the candidate can answer
the given questions.

#xample 67: X and Y are brothers. C and D are sisters.
X’s son is D’s brother. How is Y related to C?

(a) Uncle (b) Grandfather
(c) Father (d) None of these
Explanation

+X <————» +Y

+Son -D -C

As per the statement and the family tree, X’s son, D and C
are siblings. Y is the uncle of C.

Thus, (a) is the correct answer.

Example 68: ‘A is the father of ‘C’, and ‘D’ is the son of ‘B’.

[NET June 2010]

(a) Brother

(c) Father-in-law

(b) Uncle
(d) Brother-in-law
Explanation

Family tree:

+E = -C +D

Hence, D is the brother-in-law of E.
Therefore, (d) is the correct answer.

Example 70: If B is the only child of C’s grandfather’s
only daughter, then how is C’s father related to B?

(a) Maternal uncle

(b) Father

(c) Paternal uncle

(d) Cannot be determined

Explanation

C’s grandfather

B Cc

As B is the only child, C cannot be the sister of B. On the
other hand, B’s mother is the only daughter of her par-
ents, so she can have a brother. Hence, C’s father is the
maternal uncle of B.

Thus, (a) is the correct answer.

1. At the time of sunrise, if a person stands facing the
east, then his/her shadow will be towards the west.

2. Atthe time of sunset, the shadow of an object is always
in the east.

3. If a person stands facing the north, at the time of sun-
rise, his/her shadow will be towards his/her left; and
at the time of sunset, it will be towards his/her right.

4. At 12 p.m., the rays of the sun are vertically down-
ward. Hence, there will be no shadow.

Explanation

The sitting arrangement is BA D CE F. Between A and E,
there are two members D and C.

Thus, (a) is the correct answer.

FRACTIONS

Basically, a fraction describes how a part of a group
relates to the whole group. Fractions represent complete
groups that have been fractured or broken apart in some
way. They help us understand how those pieces fit into the
original group.

When we look at a fraction, we look at the number that
represents the pieces (the fractured section) on the top of
the division line. Such a number on the top is called the
numerator. The number below the line represents how
many total parts are in the group. This number is called
the denominator. To easily tell these two parts of the frac-
tion apart, just remember that denominator and down
both start with the letter d.

ber written with a numerator and a denominator, in

which both are natural numbers, for example, —

3. Mixed number fraction: It is basically a whole num-
ber plus a proper fraction. For example:

4. Improper fractions: If we divide each whole unit

into thirds, say, and keep counting them, then we will

For example: — = 4—
example 5 DB

Divide the numerator by the denominator. Write the
quotient (4) and write the remainder (1) as the numera-
tor of the fraction, do not change the denominator.

Fractions can be added, subtracted, multiplied or
divided also.

A fraction in which there is no common factor, except
1, in its numerator and denominator is called a fraction in
the simplest or lowest form.

Fractions with same denominators are called like frac-
tions and if the denominators are different, then they are
called unlike fractions. ;

° Fractions can be compared by converting them into
like fractions and then arranging them in ascending
or descending order.

° Addition (or subtraction) of like fractions is mostly
done by adding (or subtracting) their numerators.
Addition (or subtraction) of unlike fractions can be
done by converting them into like fractions.

° Fractions with denominators 10,100, etc., can be
written in a form, using a decimal point called deci-
mal numbers or decimals.

¢ Decimal numbers can be compared by using the idea
of place value; then they can be arranged in ascend-
ing or descending order.

° Decimals can be added (or subtracted) by writing
them with equal number of decimal places.

° Many of our daily life problems can be solved by
converting different units of measurements, such as
money, length and weight, in the decimal form and
then adding (or subtracting) them.

Example 82: Eiffel Tower’s ath part is painted bronze.
4 th of the remaining part is painted maroon. Rest of the

Eiffel Tower has golden colour. If the height of this golden-
coloured part is 450 m, then what is Eiffel Tower’s height?

(a) 2,250 m (b) 1,250 m
(c) 1,000 m (d) 750m
Explanation

Let’s assume that length of Eiffel Tower is 100m.

: th of 100 = 20 mis bronze.

; th ofthe remaining = z thof (100-20) = 20 mis maroon.

Rest = 100 — 20 - 20 = 60 m is golden.
If golden part is 60m, then total height = 100 m
if golden part is 1m, then total height = 100 / 60m

If golden part is 450m, then total height = 100/60 x 450
= 750m

Therefore, the actual height of Eiffel tower is 750 mm.
(d) is the right answer.

Suppose a man covers a certain distance at x kmph
and an equal distance at y kmph. Then, the average speed

during the whole journey = a kmph (also covered
x+y

under the topic of Averages).

Note: Depending on the answer choices, the kmph can

Solution: Speed = =15 kmph

also be converted into m/s by multiplying by u .

Example 84: A man covers 20 km in 2% hours. Find the
distance covered in 9 hours.

Solution: Speed = DL = 20km
T “2
Distance covered in 9 hours=S x T=8x9=72km

hours = 8 km/h

Example 85: A car completes a journey in 4 hours, the
first half at a speed of 40 kmph and the second at 60
kmph. Find the total distance covered.

Solution: As the total journey is divided into equal parts,
the average speed can be calculated by the formula 2xy/
(x+y) =2 x 40 x 60/(40+60) = 48 kmph.

Distance = S x T= 48 x 4= 192 km.

Example 86: A student walks from his house at a speed
of 3 kmph and reaches the school 10 minutes late. If he
walks at a speed of 4 kmph, then he reaches the school 10
minutes earlier. What is the distance between his school
and his house?

Solution: Let the distance be x km.
Difference between timings of reaching the School at

different speeds = 10 + 10 = 20 minutes or 20 or = = hour.
According to question: 60

Ratio AND PROPORTION

Ratios can also be expressed as fractions. They represent
the basic relationship between two quantities. Proportions
are in comparison to the whole.

In a mixture of 20 1 of milk and 30 1 of water, the ratio
of milk and water is 2 : 3. This can be converted to fraction

Thus 100

of milk in the solution as 2 : 5 or . th.
As seen, 2 is nothing but 2 x 100 = 40%.

Example 93: what percentage of 180.50 is 36.1?

(a) 20 (b) 25
(c) 20.50 (d) None of these
Solution: Let’s consider x% of 180.5 = 36.1.
x% = 36.1

180.5

x= (36.1/180.5) x 100 = 20%

Example 94: A mixture contains milk and water in the
ratio of 8:3. On adding 3 litres of water, the ratio of milk
of water becomes 2:1. Find the quantities of milk and
water in the mixture.

(a) 20 and9
(c) 12and15
Solution:

Let the original quantities of milk and water be 8a and 3a.
After adding 3 L of water.

8a (3a + 3) = 2/1

8a = 6a + 6

2a=6;a=3

Hence, milk = 8 x3 = 24Land water = 3x3+3=12L
This can be verified as present ratio = 24L:12L=2:1
Hence (d) is the answer.

Example 95: If 30 men do a piece of work in 27 days, in
what time can 18 men do another piece of workthat is 3
times bigger? .

(a) 120 days
(c) 150 days
Solution:

We work on the principle of less men, more days and more
work, more days.

Given that 30 men do 1 piece of work in 27 days

Then, 1 men can do 1 piece of work in 27 x 30 days
There 18 men can do 3 pieces (times bigger) work in (27
x 30 x 3)/18 days

(b) 9 and 24
(d) 24 and 12

(b) 135 days
(d) 180 days

27x30x3
18x1
Hence (b) is the right answer.

.. the reqd. no. of days = =135 days

Example 96: If 15 men or 24 women or 36 boys do a
piece of work in 12 days, working 8 hrs a day, how many
men must be associated with 12 women and 6 boys to

do another piece of work 27 times as great in 30 days

working 6 hrs a day?
(a) 5 (b) 8

Solution:

We can make use of following reasoning.
(1) More days : less men.

(2) Less working hrs : more men.

(3) More work : more men.

Therefore, by the rule of three,

(c) 10 (d) 12

30 days : 12 days

6 hrs : Shrs ::15men: the reqd. no. of men

1lwork : 2--works
15x12x8x2.25

th d. no. of = =18
e reqd. no. of men 30x6x1

Now, we have, 24 women = 15 men
“12 women =7.5men
And also, 36 boys = 15men
.6 boys -2- 2-2, 5men
“.12 women + 6 boys = 7.5 + 2.5 = 10men
So, 18-10=8men must be associated.

Thus, (b) is the correct answer.

Example 97; A certain sum of money is divided among A,
B and C such that for each rupee A has 65 paise and C has
40 paise. If C’s share is €8, find the sum of money.

(a) %35 (b) 38 (c) 41 (d) 45
Solution:

Here A: B:C=100:65:40=20:13:8

Their Total = 20+ 13+8=41

As a of the whole sum = 8

“. the whole sum of money =% aoe = X41

Hence, (c) is the correct answer.

Example 98: How many one rupee, fifty paise coins and
twenty five paise coins are there if their numbers are

proportional to 25 , 3 and 4. Their total worth is $210.

(a) 105, 63 and 42
(c) 90, 63 and 42

(b) 63, 42 and 105
(d) 75, 63 and 42

Solution:

°:3:4=5:6:8

Here gt

Their proportional value =SxXL6x5 8x7 =5:3:2

Their Total = 5+3+2=10

.. the value of rupees = o of 210 = 7105
The value of fifty-paise coins = a of 210 = %63

The value of 25-paise coins = - of $210 = %42

Therefore, there are 105 rupees, 126 fifty-paise coins anq
168 twenty-five paise coin.
Hence, (a) is the correct answer.

Example 99: The contents of two vessels containing water

centage Calculations

t is said that India won 50% of the matches it played,
en neither does it mean that India won 50 matches nor
es it mean that India won 0.5 matches. It means that
ia played 100 matches and won 50 match.

Now assume that India.won 40% of matches that it
yed in 2015. We have to calculate how many matches
tually won, and for that, we ought to know the total
matches played, say, for example, 25 matches. Thus, if
ia had played a total of 25 matches, then it would have

yon 40% of 25 = i x 25 = 10 matches.

Percent in the simplest sense means per cent, that is,

=0.15.

, 15
yer hundred. For example, 15% = i00

1, To convert any per cent as a part or multiple of 1,
divide it by 100, Examples: 4% = 0.04, 40% = 0.4 and
400% = 4.

2. Conversely, to write any number in the percentage
form, multiply it with 100 and append a % symbol.
Example: 2 = 200%, 0.2 = 20%, 0.02 = 2% and 0.002
=0.2%.

s seen above, x% is nothing but a fraction with numera-
or x and denominator 100. Identifying certain percent-
ges in the reduced form of the fractions can be very use-
. For example, whenever we have to calculate 20%,

If we were to convert 3/8 to percentage, simply
ultiply its percentage equivalent of 1/8 by 3. Then, we
tan answer 3 x 12.5% = 37.5%.

ithe price of acommodity increases by 25%, then by how
much percentage, a household should decrease his con-
sumption so that his total expenditure remains the same?

(a) 15% (b) 18% (c) 20%  (d) 30%
Let both consumption and prices are 100 each.

Total expenditure = price x consumption = 100 x 100

If price increases, then consumption will come down as
we have to keep the total expenditure same.

100 x 100 = (100 - x) x (100 + 25)

x= 20%

Hence, (c) is the correct answer.

Alternatively, such problems can be solved by the follow-
ing methods also.

If the price of a commodity increases by r%, then the
reduction in consumption so as not to increase the expen-
diture, is

Example 102: If two litres of water is evaporated on boiling
from 8 litres of sugar solution containing 5% sugar, find
the percentage of sugar in the remaining solution?

(a) 65% (b) 8%
(c) 9% (d) 10%
Solution:

As sugar does not evaporate, its quantity will remain same
in the remaining solution, that is 8-2 =6 litres of solution.
5% of 8 = x% of 6

Thus, x= Gx8)
Thus, (a) = 6 2/3 % is the correct answer.

Short cut formula

Suppose a quantity (such as price or salary) increases or
decreases first by x%, and then by y%. What is the net

or requirement of the question, and one or both of these
quantities may increase or decrease.

Example 103; The price of a commodity increases first by
20% and then by 10%. What is the net increase in the price?

Solution: Let original price = 100

Price after first increase = 100 + 20= 120

Price after second increase = 120 + (10% of 120) = 132
Net increase = 132 — 100 = 32%

Direct formula = 20 + 10+ [(20 x 10)/100] =32%

Example 104; On allowing two successive discounts of
20% and 15%. The selling price of an article becomes
~3060. What is the marked price of the article? (September
2022)

(a) ¥4000 (b) 4100

(c) 4200 (d) ¥4500

Solution: Let Marked Price = X

After 1% 20% discount, the discounted price = 0.80X
After 2° 15% discount, the discounted price = (0.85)
(0.80)X that is given to be 3060.

So, (0.85) (0.80)X = 3060

X = (3060 x 100 x 100) / (85)(80) = Rs 4500

Thus, (d) is the correct answer.

Example 105: The price of acommodity is first increased
by 40% and then reduced by 20%. What is the net increase
or decrease in the price?

Solution: Let the original price = 100

Price after increase = 100 + 40 = 140

Price after decrease = 140 — (20% of 140) = 112

Net increase in price = 112 — 100 = 12%

Direct formula = 40 — 20 + [40 x (—20)]/100] = 12%

Example 106: A’s income is 70% of B’s income. B’s
income is 50% of C’s income. If C’s income is 1,00,000,
then what is A’s income?

Solution: B’s income = (=) xX 1,00,000 = %50,000

A’s income = (2) x 50,000= $35,000

Example 108: The income of X is 25% more than that
income of Y. Calculate by how much percent, the income
of Y is less than that of income of X? :

(a) 18% (b) 20% (c) 25% (d) 28%

Solution: In comparison questions, the quantity With
which comparison is being done should be taken a,

Let the income of Y=%100

The income of X=%100 + 25=%125
For sake of comparison, we have to make income of X ag

Difference =

Solution: Let maximum passing marks = 100

Actual marks obtained = 50 ;

Had he scored 50+ 10% of 50, that is, 55 marks, then he
would have scored passing marks. In this situation, the dif-
ference between the actual and passing marks is 5.

Actual difference = 15

5% of maximum marks = 15

Maximum marks = 15 x 100/5 = 300

Example 110: Ina basket of fruits, 60% are mangoes and
remaining are apples. In that, 25% of the apples are green
and the rest are red. Of the mangoes, 80% are red:‘and
the rest of the mangoes are green. What percentage of the _
green fruits are mangoes?

Solution: Let us assume that the total number of fruits is
100. Here, 60 are mangoes and 40 are apples.

Green apples = 25% of 40=10

Green mangoes = 20% of 60 = 12

Total number of green fruits = 10 + 12 = 22

Thus, required percentage = 12/22 x 100 =54.5%

| Solution: . ;
| When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Here, A’s speed ig
| 80 km/h and B’s speed is 40 km/h. So, their relative speed is 80 + 40=120 KMs / hour. This comes to 2 KMs per minute,
| The total time required to travel a total distance of 140 KMs = 140 / 2 = 70 minutes. If the total time to meet is 70
| mins, and 45 mins before they actually meet is mentioned, their actual traveling is 70 ~45 = 25 minutes.
Thus, the distance travelled in 25 mins = 2 x 25 = 50 KMs
| Thus, the distance A and B are yet to cover to meet each other = Total distance (in 70 mins) — distance they trav-
felled (in 25 mins) = 140 —50 = 90 KMs. Thus, (b) is the answer.
; 3. Amilkman buys 20 litres of milk from a dairy at a cost of 750 per litre. He also buys some mineral water at the |
rate of 20 per litre and mixes it in the milk. Then, he sells the adulterated milk at a rate of 260 per litre and
earns a profit of $400. How much water did he mix in the milk? [December 2023]
| Solution:
We know that Profit = Sales — Cost

Total cost = cost of milk + cost of water

Cost of milk = %50 x 20 = $1000

Assume that X litres of water has been added into milk.

The cost of water = %20x

The total cost = 71000 + €20x

After mix up, the quantity of adulterated mix is 20 + X litres.

Total Sales = %60 (20 + X)

Profit = %60 (20 + X) — (1000 + %20x) = %400

= %1200 + 60X - 1000 - 20x = %400

60X - 20X = 400 + 1000-1200 = 200

40X = 200; X = 200/40 = 5 litres

Thus, 5 litres of water was mixed in the milk.

ow, coming to gender distribution:
emales = 40% of total = 6,00,000 x 40/100 = 2,40,000
‘Males = 6,00,000 — 2,40,000 = 3,60,000

Number of male passes = 3,60,000 x 50/100 = 1,80,000

| rotal number of female passes = 2,40,000 - 1,80,000 = 60,000
Female pass percentage = (60,000 / 2,40,000) x 100 = 25%

Solution:
: oesume that the smallest even number = X, other higher even numbers are X + 2 and X + 4
The smallest odd number = X— 11, other numbers are X- 11 + 2and X-11+4ORareX-—9 and X—7
Their sum = X + (X +2) + (K+ 4) + (K-11) + (K-11 4 2) + (K-114+4 = 231
6X = 252; K = 42
The Largest even number = 42 + 4 = 46
The smallest odd number is K-11 = 42-11 = 31
The Largest odd number = 31 + 4 = 35
Their Total = 46 + 35 = 81, thus (a) is the correct answer.

separately for repairs. After paving ¥2106 as annual taxes on the rent, he realizes 10% annually on his invest-
ment. Find the monthly rent of the bouse. [March 2023]
(a) ¥10,000 (b) %9,080
(c) %9,030 (d) 9,500

Solution:

Annual return = (10/100) x 9.0 lakhs = %90,000 a
Let’s R be the monthly rental income. 15% of this income is spent on repairs, the person is left with 85%. He pays |.

Example 115: The cost price of the goods for a shopkeeper
was X. He marked them at a 20% higher price than the
Cost Price. Finally he sold the goods at 30% discount. Did
he earn a profit or incur a loss? How much?

(a) 5% Profit (b) 5.5% Profit
(c) 10% Profit (d) 16% Profit

Solution:

Let CP = =100

Marked Price = 20% more than CP

Loss%= x100=16%

Hence, the correct answer is (d).

Example 116: One shopkeeper was offering two
successive discount of 15% and 10% on an item while the
second one is offering flat 25% discount on the same item.
From which shopkeeper should I buy the item?

(a) First Shopkeeper

(b) Second Shopkeeper

(c) Any of them; both are same

(d) Data Insufficient

ADD = 15 +10=25

MULTIPLY 15x10 _

= 1.5
100 100

Single equivalent = 25 — 1.5 = 23.5%

The single equivalent discount offered by first shop-
keeper is 23.5%.

Second shopkeeper is offering it at 25%, which makes
the item cheaper for the buyer.

Hence, (b) is the correct answer.

Example 117: An umbrella was sold at a profit of 20%.
What is the selling price of the umbrella if the shopkeeper
procured it at a cost of 180?

(a) 210 (b) 216 (c) 230 (d) 236
Solution: Substituting values in the formula above, we get:

erefore, (b) is the correct answer.

Example 123: A merchant buys 30 kg of rice at ¥40/kg
and another 20 kg of rice at ¥30/kg. He mixes them and
ells half of the mixture at $36/kg. At what price should he
ell the remaining mixture to get an overall profit of 30%?

Solution: Total cost for the entire quantity of rice =
30 x 40) + (20 x 30) = 71800.

If his profit is 30%, then sales value = 1800 x (100+30)
%2340.
He sells 25 kg at §36/kg =%900. Therefore, to make the
aid amount of profit, he should sell the remaining 25 kg
frice at 2340 —%900 = %1440.

.. The selling price of 1 kg of rice for the remaining 25
$= 1440/25 =%57.6.

the second pen = (2) x 740 = 444.

xample 124: A dealer paid a car manufacturer 7135000
or a car. What should be the selling price of the car if
fter allowing a buyer 10% discount on the selling price,
e made a profit of 8% on his outlay?

a) %1,50,000 (b) %1,60,000
c) %1,62,000 (d) %1,52,500

37%

Solution:

Here, we have to make two kinds of assumptions.
Let CP of dealer = 100
Profit = 8

SP = 100 + 8 = %108

5.27

Let us make other assumption to calculate SP after dis-
count of 10.
Now SP = %100

_ Discount = 710

Net SP = $100 - Rs 10 = %90

If Net SP is 90 then SP = %100

If Net SP is 1 then SP = 100/90 %

If Net SP is 108 then SP = 100/90 x 108 = €120

As per question again

If CP is 100 then SP = $120

If CP is Rs 1,35,000 then SP = 120/100 x 1,35,000 =
= 1,62,000

Therefore, (c) is the correct answer.

Example 125: A man sells an article at a profit of 8%. If
the cost price were 10% less and the selling price €18 less,
then his profit would have been 15%, Find the cost price
of the article.

(a) %430 (b) 450

(c) %220 (d) %400

Solution: Let C.P. of the article = 100
Thus, old S.P. = 108
New C.P. = 90 ;
As the profit is 15%, so the new SP = 90 x (115/100) =
%103.5. : .
The difference in the two S.P. = 108-103.5 = 24.5.

If difference in S.P. is Rs 4.5, then C.P. = $100

If difference in S.P. is 18, then C.P. = (100/4.5) x 18 = =400.

Therefore, (d) is the correct answer.

Simpce InreRest

When we give some house for a rent, we get rent on it.
Similarly, when we lend money to a borrower, the bor-
rower is to pay an extra amount of money to the lender.
This extra money is known as the interest. If the interest
on a sum borrowed for a certain period is reckoned uni-
formly, then it is called simple interest or the flat rate.

Principal

The money borrowed or lent out for a certain period is
called the principal or the sum. It is denoted by P.
Simple Interest Calculations

Interest is the extra money that the borrower pays for using
the lender’s money. Simple interest is denoted by S.I.

Simple interest (S.I.) =P x R x T/100. Here, Rand T are
basically rate of interest and time.

Compounp INTEREST
Here, we are exploring some simple questions on compound
interest as per NTA-NET exam pattern. Compound interest
is basically an amount paid not only on the principal amount
but also on whatever interest has been paid already. In other
words, interest amount is also added to the original principal
amount and that earns interest on the total investment.
Interest accumulated over one period is applied to
~ the principal before calculating the interest for the next
period. Typical intervals are quarterly (four times a year),
monthly, daily and on a regular basis.

The formula for compound interest is given as follows:
Compound interest =A —P
where A is the amount to be available at the end of

R N
A= P| 1+——| period..

Example 126: How much time will it take for an amount

of %900 to yield %81 as interest at 4.5% per annum of

simple interest?

(a) 2 years

(c) 1 year

Solution: P=%900

S.1.=%81

T=?

R=4.5%

T= L00xSI _ 100x81
PR 900 x 4.5

Example 127: Find S.J. on %6250 at 14% per annum for

146 days.

Therefore, (a) is the correct answer.

(b) 3 years
(d) 4 years

(b) %450
(d) %650

S.1= =%350

Example 128: A certain sum of money amounts to $1008
in 2 years and to 1164 in 3 years. Find the sum and the
rate of interest. 2

(a) 800, 14%
(c) 800, 12%
Explanation

S.1. for 1S years = %(1164 — 1008) =%156

(b) 800, 13%
(d) 800, 19%

~ SL. for 2 years = *( 156% 5 x 2] =%208

Therefore, principal = ¥(1008 — 208) = %800.

. Therefore, (b) is the correct answer.

Now, P = 800, T= 2 and S.I. = 208.

Therefore, rate = (100xS.1.) _ ie x 208)
(PxT) (800 x 2)

Explanation

Let the sum be %. exi0x7)] (x x12%5)
en we can write: (100x2) | ( (100 x2) }
This can be written as: 7x/20 ~— 3x/10 = 40.
Therefore, we have x = ¥800.
Therefore, (d) is the correct answer.

Example 130: The simple interest accrued on a sum
of certain principal is 1200 in 4 years at the rate of
8% per annum. What would be the simple interes
accrued on thrice of that principle at the rate of 6%

per annum in 3 years? (October 2022)
(a) 2150 = (b) 2050 _~—s (c) %2025 (d) ¥2100
Explanation

First, we need to calculate the Principal.
Given that SI = 71200, Rate = 8% per annum, Time = 4.
years
Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal x Rate x Time) / 100
Principal = (SI x 100) / (Rate x Time)
= (1200 x 100) / (8 x 4)

= ¥3750

New situation:
Principal = Rs 3 x 3750, Rate = 6% per annum, Time =
3 years

New Simple Interest (SI) = (3 x 3750) x 6x 3/100
SI = (67500) / 100 SI = %2025

Thus (c) is the correct answer.

7 years at a simple interest. The sum is ;

(a) %1800 (b) 2000
(c) %1400 (d) ¥1250
Explanation

2500 in the fifth year and 3000 in the seventh year.
Therefore, in the gap of 2 years, 500 has increased.
=> For a year, 500/2 = 250.

Thus, there is per year increase of 250; then in 5 years
= 250x5=1250

Hence, the initial amount must be 2500 ~ 1250
= %1250.

Therefore, (d) is the correct answer.

AVERAGES

The arithmetic mean or simply ‘average’ or ‘mean’ of a
group of values is the sum of the values divided by the
total number of values. It is one of the measures of central

tendencies. It is denoted by X, where X is the variable,
such as height, weight and score.

Average of n observations =
n= Yx/n

Combined average: NX, +N, X, ++ +N X/(N, +N, +.
+N), where N,,N,, ..., N_ are the respective numbers
of observations in different groups and X,, X,, ..., X, are
the averages.

Suppose a man covers a certain distance at x kmph and
an equal distance at y kmph, or x and y are the speeds
in going to a station and coming back; then the average
speed during the whole journey is

2xy
x+y
Example 136: If a candidate scores 5, 15, 25, 10 and

15 marks in different subjects, then calculate the mean
marks scored by the candidate.

Example 137: The average age of 30 boys in a class is 15

years. If the age of the teacher is also included, then the

new average age becomes 16 years. What is the age of the
teacher?

Mean marks = 14

Solution: Here, average age = total age/number
Total age = Average age x Number
Total age = 15 x 30 = 450 years
New total age = 16 x 31 = 496

The new total age is higher because the age of the
teacher is also included in it.

Age of teacher = 496 ~ 450 = 46 years

Example 138: India scores 52 runs in the first 10 overs ~

in a 50 over one day cricket match against Pakistan. What
should be the run rate in the remaining 40 overs to reach
the target of 252 runs?

Solution: The score required in 40 overs = 252 — 52 =
200 runs
Average required run rate in 40 overs = 200/40=5

Example 139: The average monthly income of A and B is
%5050. The average monthly income of B and C is $6250
and the average monthly income of A and C is $5200. The
monthly income of A is

(a) 3500 = (b) T4000 _-~=—s (c) 24050 ~— (d) 5000

Solution: Total income of A and B = (5050 x 2) = $10,100
@
Total income of B and C = (6250 x 2) =%12,500 (ii)
Total income of A and C = (5200 x 2) = 10,400 (iii)
Adding (i), Gi) and (iii), we get 2(A+B+C) =33,000
Or A+B+C=16,500
But B + C = 12,500 from Equation (ii)
Hence, A= 16,500 — 12,500 = 4000
Therefore, (b) is the correct answer.
Example 140: A person divides his total route of journey
into two equal parts. The speeds for both the parts are
40 km/h and 30 km/h. Find his average speed during the
entire journey.
(a) 32 km/h (b) 34.3 km/h
(c) 36.3 km/h (d) 38 km/h

Solution: If x and y and z are two speeds during the
journey, we can use the following formula to calculate the
average speed =

2xy
(x+y)
Average speed = @ x40 x30)
(40 + 30)
= 2x40 30) 39) _ 34.3 km/hr

Hence, (b) is the correct answer.

Example 141: A train starts full of passengers. At the
first station, it drops one-third of these and takes in 96
more. At the next, it drops one-half of the new total and
takes in 12 more. On reaching the next station, there are
found to be 248 left. With how many passengers has the

train started with?
(a) 464 (b) 520

(c) 564 (d) 680

Solution: Let the train start with X passengers.

After dropping one-third and taking in 96 passengers, the
train has

x

x-2496=2*..96 _2x +288

 35+7

35x +42 = 42x — 42

x=12

Thus, the original expenditure of the mess = 35 x 12=%420
Hence (d) is the correct answer. :

Example 143: One third of a certain journey is covered
at the rate of 25 km/h, one fourth at the rate of 30 km/h,
and the rest at 50 km/h. Find the average speed of whole
journey.

(a) 34 km/h (b) 33 = km/h
(c) 35 km/h (d) 325 kan/h

Solution: Let the total journey be x km.

Then 3 km travelled at the speed of 25 km/h and t km

at 30 km/hr and the rest of distance (x — 5 -—

travelled at the speed of 50 km/h.
Total time taken during the journey of x km

In NET examination, usually one simple calendar ques-
tion is asked. We need to be familiar with a few concepts.

It is necessary to know the concept of ‘odd days’ to
solve calendar problems. We are supposed to find the day
of the week on a given date.

Odd days: In a given period, the number of days more
than the complete weeks is called odd days. ©

Leap year: A leap year has 366 days. Every year divisible
by 4 is a leap year, but not if it is a century. Only every
fourth century year is a leap year.

Examples: Each of the years, such as 1880, 1988, 2004,
2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, is a leap year.

Each of the years, such as 400, 800, 1200, 1600 and
2000, is a leap year, but 1700, 1800, 1900, and so on are
not leap years.

CouNTING oF Opp Days

01 January 0001 is assumed to be a Monday.

1 ordinary year = 365 days = 52 weeks + ‘1 day’. That 1
extra day is counted as odd day.

1 leap year = 366 days = (52 weeks + 2 days)
1 leap year has 2 odd days.
100 years = 76 ordinary years + 24 leap years
= (76 x 1+ 24 x 2) odd days = 124 odd days
= (17 weeks + 5 days).
It means 5 odd days.
Therefore, the number of odd days in 100 years is 5.
Number of odd days in 200 years = (5 x 2) = 10 days. If
further divided by 7, then it gives us 3 odd days.
Number of odd days in 300 years = (5 x 3) = 15 days,
which means ‘1 odd day’.
Number of odd days in 400 years = (5 x 4+ 1) =0 odd day

Similarly, each one of 800th year, 1200th year, 1600th
year, 2000th year, 2400th year, and so on has 0 odd day.

Day oF THE Week RELATED To Opp Days

We usually count days from Sunday.

For example, if as per our calculation the number
of ‘odd days’ is 2, then it means that the answer will be
Tuesday.

Example 147: What was the day of the week on 1 January

2001? [June 2009]
(a) Friday (b) Tuesday

(c) Sunday (d) Wednesday
Explanation

By the end of centuries 400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2400
and so on, there are no extra days left. It means that the
last year 2000 was Sunday.

As per convention, the week starts with Monday and
hence, the next day after last day of year 2000, that is,
1 January 2001, is Monday.

Therefore, (b) is the correct answer.

Example 148: 1 January 1995 was a Sunday. What
would be the day of the week on 1 January 1996?

[December 2009]
(a) Sunday (b) Monday
(c) Wednesday (d) Saturday
Explanation

There is an increase of 1 day (odd day) in the subsequent
year. In case of a leap year (if the day is after February),
there will be an increase of 2 days.

Although 1996 is a leap year, the day in question is
in January, so there will be an increase of 1 day. Thus,
1 January 1996 is Monday.

Therefore, (b) is the correct answer.

Example 149: On 12 January 1980, it was a Saturday.
The day of week on 12 January 1979 was a

(a) Thursday (b) Friday
(c) Saturday (d) Sunday

Explanation

Although 1980 is a leap year, it would not have any impact
on the calculation as the date in the question is in January
month (and before 28 February). Thus, it is assumed as a
normal year. There is a gain of 1 day in the next year.

However, here, we will do backward calculation, and
subtract 1 day from the year 1980. If it was Saturday, then
the same day in the previous year was to be Friday.

Therefore, (b) is the correct answer.

Example 150: If 1 October is Monday, then 1 November
will be

(a) Thursday (b) Friday
- (c) Sunday (d) Monday
Explanation

October has 31 days. 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29 dates of October
will be Mondays. Thus, 1 November will be a Thursday.

Therefore, (a) is the correct answer.

Example 151: If the first day of the month is Sunday,
then what date will be 3 days after the fourth Wednesday
in the month? [June 1998]

(a) 24 (b) 29 (c) 27 (d) 30

Explanation

First Wednesday of the month will be on 4th day of the
month, 2nd Wednesday will be on 11th, 3rd Wednesday
on 18th and 4th Wednesday on 25th. Now, 3 days afte,
25th, which means 25 + 4 = 29th day of the month.

Therefore, (b) is the correct answer.
Example 152: If the first day of the ordinary year (othe;

than the leap year) was Friday, then which was the la
day of that year?

(b) Thursday

(a) Wednesday
(c) Friday (d) Sunday
Explanation

An ordinary year has 365 days. Week starting with Friday
will end in Thursday. Hence, the 364th day (end of com:
plete 52 weeks) will be Thursday. The 365th day will be
Friday. Thus, the first and last days of an ordinary year
are same.

Therefore, (c) is the correct answer. a |
Solution:

Example 153: It was Monday on 1 January 2007. What.
was the day of the week on 1 January 2011?
(a) Sunday (b) Saturday

(c) Friday (d) Wednesday

Explanation

Odd days in 2007 = 1 (2007 is an ordinary year and we are
doing calculation from January 1)
Odd days in 2008 = 2 (2008 is a leap year)
Odd days in 2009 = 1 (ordinary year)
Odd days in 2010 = 1 (ordinary year)
Thus, 1 January 2011 will be Monday plus 5 days, that
is, Saturday.

Therefore, (b) is the correct answer.

Example 154: If the 4th Saturday of a month is the 22nd
day, then what day is the 13th day of the month?

(a) Tuesday (b) Wednesday
(c) Thursday (d) Friday
Explanation

The earlier 3 Saturdays are on 15th, 8th and Ist. If 15th is
Saturday, Thursday falls on 13th. Thus, 13th is Thursday.

Therefore, (c) is the correct answer.

Angle (between minute hour and hour hand) = [(11/2) M
— 30H)] where M shows minutes and H shows hours.

155. We assume that the hours hand is closer to 12 than
the minutes hand in a conventional clock. At which
of the following timings the angle between 10 am
and 11 am will the angle between the minutes hand
and hours hand be 3°
(a) 10:45 (b) 10:50 (c) 10:54 (d) 10:58

measure the angle from 12 in clockwise direction.

fagie made by hours hand = 10(360°/12) + x(30°/60)
2 10(30°) + x (1/2) = 300° + x/2 (1)
angle made by minutes hand = x(360°/60)
= x(6°) ..-(2)
jven that hours hand is nearer to 12 than minutes
and, i.e., hours hand crossed minutes hand.
fence, (1) - (2) = 3°
300°+ x/2 — 6x = 3°
=> -11x/2 = -297
wex= 54
ence, the time will be 10:54.
‘hus, the answer is option (c).

6. At which of the following timings the hands of the
» clock will show the mirror image of 4:10?
(a) 7:10 (b) 7:40 (c) 7:50 (d) 8:10

tion:

4:10

It should be 7:50.
So, the answer is option (c).

7:50

57.A and C are running on a circular track with the
speeds of 20m/s and 24m/s. A is running in the
clockwise direction and C is running in the anti-
clockwise direction. At how many distinct points
these two will meet on the circular track?

(a) 5 (b) 6 (c) 11 (d) 10

If two bodies are moving in opposite direction with
their speeds in the ratio a: b, the number is distinct
points at which they meet on a circular track = a + b.
Here, the ratio = 20:24 => 5:6

Therefore, number of distinct points = 5+6 = 11
So, the answer is option (c).

58. What is the angle made between the hour and min-
ute hands of a clock 30 minutes after they meet for
the third time in a day?

(a) 150 degrees (b) 165 degrees

(c) 180 degrees (d) can’t be calculated

In thirty minutes, the minute hand covers 180
degrees and hour hand covers 15 degrees. So, angle
between the hands is 165 degrees.

So, the answer is option B.

159. For how many times in a day do the minute and hour
hands of a clock overlap?
(a) 23 (b) 24 — (ec) 22

8 (d) Any number

5.33

Solution:
In twelve hours,.the hands overlap 11 times. So, ina

day, they overlap 22 times.
So, the answer is option C.

In NET Paper I examination, one or two questions are asked
about Venn diagrams almost every time. While the circles
or figures (also called sets) deal with individual data items,
the number shown in rectangle is the total number (rectan-
gle is also known as universal set).

There can be other shapes such as triangles and squares
to represent data. The following examples will help in better
understanding on how to solve questions on Venn diagrams.

The main aim of this section is to test your ability about
the relation between some items of a group by diagrams.
In these questions, some figures of circles and some words
are given. You have to choose a figure that represents the
given words.

Some critical examples are as follows:

1. If all the words are of different groups, then they will
be shown by the diagram as follows:

Dog, Cow and Horse

All these three are animals but of different groups,
and there is no relation between them. Hence, they
will be represented by three different circles.

2. If few words belong to acommon group: |
Cow, Horse and Mammals

Mammals

Co) (sm)

3. If one word belongs to a second group that further
belongs to the third group:

Gow, Mammais and Animal kingdom



=== Page 64 ===
§.34

Mammals

Animal kingdom

4. If there is some relation between two items and these
two items are completely related to a third item, then
they will be shown as follows:

Men, Brother and Father

Brother

Men

Some brothers may be fathers and vice versa.
Similarly, some fathers may not be bothers and vice
versa. But all the fathers and all the brothers belong
to the group men.

5. Two items are related to a third item to some extent but
not completely and the first two items are totally different:

Students, Boys and Girls

The boys and girls are different genders while some
boys may be students. Similarly, among girls, some
may be students.

6. All the three items are related to one another but to
some extent and not completely:

Boys, Students and Athletes

a

OX

Some boys may be students and vice versa.
Some boys may be athletes and vice versa.
Some students may be athletes and vice versa.

7. Two items are related to each other completely and the.

third item is entirely different from the first two:
Lions, Carnivorous and Cows

Carnivorous
animals

Alllions are carnivorous but no cowisa lion oracarnivore.

8. The first item is partially related to the second, but the -

third is entirely different from the first two:
Dogs, Flesh eaters and Cows

Flesh
eaters

Some dogs are flesh eaters but not all, whereas any |

dog or any flesh eater cannot be cow.

There can be many other situations too.

Now, we discuss Venn diagram to solve mathemati-
cal problems. This can be used as an easier approach
to solve problems, which can be practised by students
from non-mathematical background also.

Example 160: Ina class, there are:

(a) 8 students who play football and hockey.

(b) 7 students who do not play football'or hockey.
(c) 13 students who play hockey.

(d) 19 students who play football.

jd go inside the intersection because they need to be
th circles. The seven students who do not play either
e two games should go outside because they should
ein either of the circles.

Hi

There are 13 students who play hockey, so the numbers
he hockey circle should add up to 13.

There are 8 students in the intersection, so there are 5
o play hockey but not football.

imilarly, there are 19 students who play football.

The students who play football but not hockey must be
~8=11.

Thus, the total number of students in the class = 11+8
5+7=31.

here are 31 students in the class.

xample 161: In a class, there are 30 students.

) 21 students like Maths.

) 16 students like English.

) 6 students don’t like Maths or English. _

ow many students like both Maths and English?

§.35

The 6 students who do not like either of the two subjects
go outside because they should not be in either circles. We
know that the total in the Maths circle needs to be 21, but we
cannot put this in because we don’t know how many should
go inside the intersection (if they like both subjects) and

‘how many should go on the left (if they like only Maths).

Step II

21 in
total like

Maths

There are 30 students in the class, and if there are 6 stu-
dents outside the circles, then the other 3 sections must
add up to 24.

Furthermore, there are 21 students who like Maths, so
the middle and left sections must add up to 21. This leaves
3 on the right as 24-21=3.

Step III

6

There are 16 students who like English. Hence, the 2 parts
of the English circle should add up to 16 and so we can
find the number in the intersection by doing 16-3 = 13.

There are 21 students who like Maths. There are 8 (got by
21 — 13) who like Maths but not English. If we check all the
four facts given to us, then we can see that they are all true.

There are 13:'students who like both Maths and English.

162. Which of the following statement/s is/are correct?
[December 2021]
A. Yaman crosses a 600m long road in 5 minutes. His
speed is 7.2 km/hr
Vinod performs 2/15 of his total journey by train;
9/20 by bus and rest 10 km on cycle. His total
journey is 24 km
C... Anita can complete a work in 8 days. She can com-
plete 1/8 fraction of the work in two days.

Choose the correct answer from the options given below

(a) Aonly (b) B only
(c) Aand B only (d) Aand C only



=== Page 66 ===
5.36

Solution:

A. Yaman travels 600 m in 5 minutes, that means his
speed in m/s is
Speed (in m/s) = 600 m / 300 seconds = 2 m/s
Multiplying it by 18/5 will give us Km/hr
Speed (in Km/hr) = 2x 18/5 = 7.2 km/hr
B. Let’s assume that total journey = 1
Journey by train and bus = 2/15 + 9/20 = 35/60
= 7/12
Journey on cycle = 1—7/12 = 5/12
Let’s verify this: 5/12 of 24 Kms = 10 Kms
Thus, this statement is correct.
C. Anita’s 8 day’s work = 1
Her 1 day’s work = 1/8
Her 2 day’s work = 1/8 x 2= 1/4
So, this statement is not correct.
Overall, (c) is the correct answer.

163. The owner of a mobile phone charges his customer
25% more than the cost price. If a customer paid
8,000/- for a mobile phone, then what was the cost

price of the mobile? [December 2021]
(a) ¥5600 (b) €6000
(c) %6400 (d) ¥7000

Solution:

The owner sells the mobile at the profit of 25%. The
customer pays * 8000 for it.

Let the CP = %x

SP = x + 25% of x = 1.25X

1.25x = ¥8000 (given)

X =8000/1.25

X = %6400

Thus, the CP = 6400

Correct answer is (c).

164. Given the relationship between variables Y and X :

Y = X?; if X changes by 6%. What is the percantage
change in Y?

(a) ~ 36% (b) ~12%
(c) ~ 8% (d) ~6%
Solution:
Y= xX?

Let the value of X = 100

Y = (100)? = 10000

New value of X = 100 + 6 = 106

New value of Y = (106)? = 11236

Thus, the difference in the value of Y = 11236-10000
= 1236

Percentage difference = 1236 / 10000 x 100 = 12.36%
= 12% apprx

Short cut method = 6 + 6+ (6x6) /100 = 12.36%
Correct Answer is (b)

165. A seller mixes 26 kg rice of a price of ¥20/kg, with
30 kg of different variety rice of a price of €36/kg.
He sells both the mixed rices at ¥30/kg. What will
be the profit in percentage? [December 2021]

(a) 5% (b) 10% (c) 15% (d) 20%

Solution:

Total Input cost of 56 kg (26 + 30) of rice = ¥ (26x 29

+ 30 x 36) = = (520 + 1080) = 71600

Then selling price of 56 kg rice =%56 x 30 = 71680 |

Profit = 1680 — 1600 = =80
Profit percentage = 80/1600 x 100 = 5%

166. A milk man purchases milk at =X per litre and sells j
at 2x per litre. Still he mixes 2 litres of water with
every 6 litre of pure milk. What is his profit percent.

age? [December 2021]
(a) 33.33 (b) 66.66
(c) 133.33 (d) 166.66

Solution:

Let the total quantity = 6 L. And Price is 71 per L
Then total CP = 6x1 = %6
Total quantity sold = 2x6+2=14L
Total SP = 2x6+2x2=%16
Profit = ~16-Rs 6 = 710
Profit percentage = (16 — 6)/6 x 100
= 10/6 x 100
= 166.66%
Thus (d) is the answer.

167. The average monthly income of P and Q is 5,050/-.

The avarage montly income of Q and R is 6,250/~

and that of P and R is ~5,200. What will be the
monthly income of P? [December 2021]

(a) %3,000/— (b) %3,500/~
(c) ~4,000/— (d) 4,500/—
Solution:

Let P, Q and R represent their respective monthly

income. Then, we have:

Total income

P+Q=5050x2 = 10100

Q+R=6250x 2 = 12500

P+R=5200x2 = 10400

Adding
2P + 2Q + 2R=2(P+ Q+R) = £10100 + 12500 +
10400 = ¥33000

P+Q+R= 33000/ 2 = ~16500

P + (12500) = 16500

P = % 16500 — 12500 = ¥4000

Thus (c) is the right answer.

168. The average of 4 terms is 20, and the first term is
1/3rd of sum of the remaining 3 terms. What will be
the value of first term?
(a) 15 (b) 20 (c) 25 ‘(d) 30

Solution:

Let the terms are A, B, C andD

Their total = A+B+C+D=4x20=80.....(D

Thus, A = 80/4 = 20

Alternative solution: The average of 4 terms is 20.

Again, A represent the one third of sum of rest of
hree terms. This shows that A itself is equal to aver-
age value. That average (of 20) is already given to us
nthe question statement. Thus, the answer is (b).

= 30 — (200/100)% = (30 — 2)% = 28%

(1)

Thus, we get the ratio. As a matter of fact, their total .

§.37

Now, we want to see the impact of this calculated dis-
count of 28% and 25% with same formula.

= [28 + 25 — (28 x 25/100)]%

= (53-7) % = 46%
Thus, the statement A is true.

Question Part B

CP of mobile = 18225, Loss = 20%, SP (given) = 14500
We can directly calculate SP.

SP = 18225 x (100-20)/100 = 18225 x 4/5 =% 14580
Thus, calculated SP does not tally with the given SP,
so it’s a wrong statement.

Question Part C

Let loss = x and selling price = 3x

Loss = CP — SP

X = CP~3X

CP =X + 3X = 4X

Now % age loss = 4X — 3X/ 4X x 100 = 25%

Hence, statement C is a false statement.

Only statement A is correct. (d) is the correct answer.

171. In a class of 65 students, 27 speak Hindi, 21 speak
English and 17 speak Bangla. 7 speak only Eng-
lish and Hindi, 6 speak only Hindi and Bangla and
5 speak only English and Bangla. If 12 speak only
Hindi then how many speak all the three languages.

[November 2020]
(a) 5 (b) 2
(c) 4 (d) 3
Solution:

Students who speak all the three languages =
Students who can speak Hindi~(Students who can
speak only Hindi + Students who speak only English
and Hindi + Students who speak only Hindi and
Bangla)

= 27-(12 + 7 + 6)

= 27-25

=2
Hence, (b) is the correct answer.

172. How many terms are there in the series
[December 2021]
168,175,185, __ __, 266?
(a) 13/13 (b) 14/14
(c) 15/15 (d) 16/16



=== Page 68 ===
5.38

(Pore rere RCSL CAAA AGA Ae tao areca ephnnfpunonnetsacontteerarsncccnstne

Solution:

The first term in the series = 168

Common difference = 175 - 168 = 182-175 =7
Let the number of terms in the series = n

The nth terms of the series = 266

Therefore, 168 + (n-1) 7 = 266

7n = 266 —- 168 + 7

‘Jn = 105

n=15

Thus, there are 15 terms given in the series.

The total terms can be calculated manually also.

173. Given below are two statements [December 2021]

Statement I: The compound interest on % 280 for 18
months at 18% per annum is % 44.3.

Statement II: At 5.6% rate of simple interest, a
certain sum will be doubled in 15 years.

In light of the above statements, choose the correct
answer from the options given below:

(a) Both Statement I and Statement II are true
(b) Both Statement I and Statement II are false
' (c) Statement I is true but Statement II is false
(d) Statement I is false but Statement II is true

Solution:
Statement I:
Compound Interest = SI of First year + SI for 1/2 year
(on total amount of first year)
SI for first year = 10% of 280 = %28
Principal for next six months = 280 + 28 = 308
SI for these six months = 308 x5 x 1/100 = 15.40
Thus, total interest = ¥28 + ¥15.40 = %43.40

This question can be directly solved by compound
interest formula.

There is difference of 10 paisa in calculated amount
and given amount of % 43.3 in the statement. Thus, it
is not correct.

Statement 2: As the amount is calculated on SI, that
amount will remain the same through 15 years. Thus,
in 15 years, the principal amount of ¥100 will add
15 x 5.6 = %84. So, it is not doubling. This statement
is also wrong.

174. A total of 324 coins of 20 paise and 25 paise make
a sum of 71. The number of 20 paise coins is

[December 2021]
(a) 144 (b) 124
(c) 200 (d) 125
Solution: —

Let the coins of 20p = X

Then the coins of 25p = 324-—X

Total value = X. 20p + (324 ~X).25p
=X.1/5 + (324-X).1/4=71

. = X/5 + 81-X/4=71

X/5 — X/4 = 71-81 = -10

-X/20 =-—10

X= 10x20 = 200
Hence, the number of 20p coins is 200. The COrrect
answer is (c).

175. The incomes of Ravi and Kavita are in the ratio 2:3
are their expenditures are in the ratio 3:5. If each
saves = 100, then Ravi’s income is

[December 2021]
(a) %200 (b) 600 :
(c) ¥400 (d) 100
Solution:

Let the incomes of Ravi and Kavita are 2x and 3x,
Income = Saving + Expenditure

Expenditure = Income — saving, the ratio of their
expenditures is 3:5

Thus, 2x ~— 100/3x~ 100 = 3/5

3(3x- 100) = 5 (2x-— 100)

9x —- 300 = 10x-—500

x = %200

Thus, income of Ravi = 2x = 2 x 200 = 400

176. The new cost of a mobile which has been discounted
by 15% is 3230. What was the cost of the mobile.

originally? [December 2021]
(a) $3675 (b) $3650
(c) ¥3600 (d) 3800

Solution:

Let original cost (OC) = 100
New cost = 100~—15 = 85

85% of OC = 3230

OC = 3230 x 100 / 85 = Rs 3800
The correct answer is (d).

(¢) 642 (d) 792

fion:
a there are two numbers, the question is going to be

OM x HCF = 1* number x 2°¢ number
376 X 33 = 297 x 24 number
hus 2° number = 2376 x 33 / 297 = 264

if Amit works 5 hours a day, he can complete the job
in 8 days. Bobby can complete the same job in 10
days by working 6 hours a day. If they start working
together 4 hours a day, in how many days, they will
complete the job?

(a) 3 days (b) 6 days

(c) 4 days (d) 8 days

tion:

he total hours taken by Amit to complete the job =
x 8 = 40 hours

he total hours taken by Bobby to complete the job =
0 x 6 = 60 hours

Thus, one hour job work of Anu and Bobby

0 |= 2400_| = [2400

ratas ence, Amit and Bobby together can finish the job in
4 hours. Working 6 hours a day, the job will be com-
leted in 6 days.

0. The income of A is 150% of the income of B and the
income of C is 120% of the income of A. If the total
income of A, B and C together is Rs. 86000, what is
B’s income?

(a) 20000 (b) 26000

(c) 28000 (d) 25000

Let’s assume that income of B is Rs. 100, then

120 x 150

A:B:C = 150: 100:

10
Thus, share of B = x 86000 = 20000

‘1. Channel A can fill the storage tank in 6 hours, Chan-
nel B can fill the same in 10 hours and Channel C can
empty the tank in 5 hours. The first two Channels

§.39

are kept open for 3 hours in the beginning and then
the third Channel is also opened. In what time is the

tank full?

(a) 5 hours (b) 6 hours

(c) 8 hours (d) 10 hours
Solution:

We take the LCM of 5, 6 and 10, and assume it to be
the total work, which is = 30

Work done by A and B for 3 hours = (5 + 3) x3 = 24
Balance of work = 30-24 = 6

When C is also opened for emptying the tank after
3 hours, then A, B and C can complete the balance work
in[6/ (5 + 3-6)] = 3 hours

Thus, total time taken to fill the tank = 3 + 3 = 6hours.
Hence, option B is correct.

182. The ratio of the ages of Anglika and her mother is
1: 4 and the ratio of the ages of Anglika’s mother
and her brother is 9 : 1. If Esha’s brother is 5 years
younger than Anglika. What will be the age of Ang-
lika’s mother after 4 years?

(a) 36 years (b) 40 years -
(c) 45 years (d) 50 years
Solution:

Anglika : her mother = 1: 4
Her mother : Her brother = 9: 1
Anglika: Her mother : Her brother = 9 : 36: 4
Now, ATQ
9x-4x=5
5x=5
x=1
Anglika mother age after 4 years = 36 x 1+ 4 = 40
years

183. What is the angle between two hands of a clock
when it is 50 minutes past 5 o’ clock?

(a) 95° (b) 88°
(c) 110° (d) 125°
Solution:

We can solve this question directly by this formula

Angle = [(11/2) M - 30 H] where M and H shows
minute and hours in the question.

So, our answer = [11/2 x 50-30 x 5]
= 275-150 = 125 degrees

In case, we get answer in minus, even then the answer
is to be taken in absolute value terms.

184. What should be the angle in degrees between the
minute and hour hands of a clock at 8:30 ?

(a) 60 (b) 75
(ec) 85 (d) 90
Solution:

The answer by the direct formula
= 11/2x30-30x8
= 165 - 240 = - 75 degrees

Thus, minus sign is to be ignored. (b) is the correct
answer.

185.The difference between two numbers is 2500. If
larger number is divided by smaller number, the
quotient comes to be 8. The remainder comes to be
50. The smaller number is

(a) 250 (b) 280
(c) 350 (d) 400
Solution:

Let’s assume that numbers are ‘n’ and ‘2500 + n’
According To Question

2500 + n= 8n +50

8n-—n = 2500~50

7n = 2450

n= 2450/7 = 350

Hence, option C is the correct answer.

186. Rupesh borrowed 8300 from Shah at the rate of
12% per annum at simple interest for 3 years. He
added some money to the borrowed sum. That
money was then lent to Sonia for 3 years at 14% per
annum interest. If Rupesh gains 939 in the whole

transaction. Find out what amount had he added

from his own pocket?

(a) $115 (b) $120

/ (c) $125 (d) €105

: Solution:

Let’s take the difference between two amounts of
interest.

(830 +) x 14x 3 830 x 12x 3|

100 Gere

830 x 42 + 42x- 830 x 36 = 9390
42x + 830 x (42~36) = 9390

| 42x = 9390 - 4980 = x =

Thus, the amount added = % 105

187.The sum of five numbers is 5200. The average of
the first two numbers is 800 and average of last two
numbers is 1400. Determine the third number?
(a) 660 (b) 800
(c) 1500 (d) 1200

p

Solution:
The sum of first two numbers is 2 x 800 = 1600
The sum of last two numbers is 2 x 1400 = 2800

Thus, the middle third number = 5200 — (1.600 + 2800
= 800

188. The sum of the present ages of a father and his Son
is 100 years. 5 Years ago their ages was in the ratio
of 2: 1. The ratio of the age of father and son afte,

20 years will be
(a) 15:13 (b) 17:11
(c) 11:19 (d) 20:23
Solution:
Let us assume that present ages of father and son are
xand y.
We have been given, x + y= 100
=x=100-y.... @

X-2vV +5 =O. eee (ii)

Putting the value given eqn. (i) in eqn. (ii)
100-y-2y+5=0

100-3y +55 =0

105 = 3y

105

Now putting value of y in eqn. (i)
x = 100-35 = 65 years
Thus, the ratio of present ages of father and son

[x

We are starting our discussion on a very positive keynote,

how to explore the knowledge in a logical and innovative

manner.

Newton’s Apple Story: There is well-known story of

Newton sitting under an apple tree, where an appie fall-

| ing on his head is said to have inspired his thinking about
the Universal Law of Gravitation. This story illustrates the
process of an idea becoming explicit knowledge.

1

j
i

Implicit versus Explicit Knowledge: Before New-
ton’s realization, apples were falling to Earth, but the
understanding of gravity was implicit and not formal-
ized into a theory. What Newton did was make this
implicit knowledge explicit through the formulation
of the Universal Law of Gravitation.

2. Knowledge and Theories: The development of theo-
ries is essential for understanding the world and solv-
ing problems.

3. The Importance of Reasoning: In life, many prob-
lems require solutions. Reasoning is a crucial tool in
solving these problems. It helps people differentiate
between what is right and what is wrong. The basic
types of reasoning are deductive and inductive.

4. Variety of Theories: The different individuals may
express or formulate the same theory in various ways.
This diversity in approaches leads to progress in life,
as it encourages new perspectives and ideas.

5. Logic as a Way of Life: This trains individuals in
methods to differentiate between right and wrong. It
is a fundamental tool for critical thinking and rational
decision-making.

6. Flow of Knowledge: The flow of knowledge occurs in

two ways: deductive and inductive reasoning. Deduc-

tive reasoning moves from general principles to spe-
cific conclusions, while inductive reasoning goes from
specific observations to general principles.

Just like solving a fun puzzle or playing with Lego
bricks, logic is all about making connections and discov-
ering new things!

Basic Structure of ARGUMENTS

An argument, in the context of logic and critical think-
ing, is a set of statements, propositions and conclusions.
Premises intend to provide evidence or-reasons to accept
the conclusion.

Logical argument

Evidence/
Accepted facts

Inference

What is claimed to follow
rom the evidence?

Ficure 6.1

1, Premises: These are the statements, claims, or Ppiec
of evidence presented to support the conclusio
Premises are intended to provide reasons or suppo
for accepting the conclusion as true.

2. Conclusion: The conclusion is the statement that th
argument seeks to establish or prove. It is the maj
point or claim that follows from the premises. Th
conclusion is what the arguer wants the audience t
accept.

3. Inferential Relationship: This is again based on.
arguments. The concept of an inferential relation.
ship is linked to both deductive and inductive reason,
ing. In deductive reasoning, the inferential relation.
ship is very strong and strict.In inductive reasoning,
the inferential relationship is weaker.We will stud
more about these in validity, soundness, strength and
cogency.

Arguments can take the form of simple everyday con.
versations to formal and structured logical arguments
used in philosophy, law, and other fields. ;

Arguments play a crucial role in critical thinking and
reasoning, evaluating evidence, make a case, and per.
suade others. The critical thinking involves assessing
the strength and validity of arguments, identifying fal
lacies, and making informed judgments about the truth
or acceptability of conclusions based on the provided
evidence.

Probable Words in Premises

° The term 'because' serves as an indicator for present
ing a reason or premise to support a claim. Proving an
argument 'as an argument’ is important to us.

° The claims can be categorized into three main types:
Value, Policy, and Factual claims.

° The premises, or supporting reasons, may be intro-
duced using various words and phrases like 'as,' ‘due _
to,' ‘as indicated by,' 'for the reason that,' ‘owing to,'
‘through, 'in the view of,' and more.

Identifying Concluding Statements

° Conversely, the presence of the word 'therefore' or its
synonyms signals the formulation of a conclusion or
claim.

* Words such as ‘accordingly,’ ‘consequently,’ ‘infer
that,' hence,’ 'prove that,' 'conclude that,' and similar
terms also signify the conclusion of an argument.

Example Illustration

e Consider the argument: 'The internet is a valuable
invention.’
° Practically, we get flexible with the use of such words
or marks.
e In this example, we reinforce the claim that the intet-
net is valuable with logical reasons such as 'It is a vast
source of information’ and ‘It offers extensive enter-
tainment options.'



=== Page 74 ===
he logical reasons provided lead us to the conclusion
at the internet is indeed a valuable invention.

ating Arguments

en assessing an argument, it is crucial to examine
oth its structural elements and its content.

urther exploration of argument evaluation will be
iscussed in the upcoming sections.

. revised structure breaks down the discussion into
jnct sections, making it easier for readers to follow
understand the key concepts related to argument
struction and evaluation.

ogism: Syllogism is also a form of argument that is
nected with deductive reasoning, basically follows a
ctured and standardized pattern, which consists of a
ior premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion which
be discussed afterwards. This intends to draw the con-
ion in a valid and logically sound manner. Through
uctive reasoning, we get an idea about validity, truth,

he human brain can pro ably b
rm complex tasks.

1. Which of the following is a valid syllogism?

(a) All cats are mammals. Some mammals are furry.
Therefore, all cats are furry.

(b) All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore,
Socrates is a mortal.

(c) All birds have feathers. Some animals have feath-
ers. Therefore, all animals are birds.

(d) All dogs are mammals. Some mammals are carni-
vores. Therefore, all dogs are carnivores. —

Which of the following is an example of a deductive
argument?

6.3

(a) All swans that have been observed have been
white. Therefore, all swans are white.

(b) If it is raining, then the ground is wet. It is raining.
Therefore, the ground is wet.

(c) Smoking causes lung cancer. Therefore, I should
not smoke.

(d) All mammals have four legs. My dog is amammal.
Therefore, my dog has four legs.

3. Ina syllogism, the term that appears in both premises
but not in the conclusion is called the:
(a) Major term
(b) Minor term
(c) Middle term
(d) Predicate term

4. Which of the following represents a valid syllogism?

(a) All men are birds. John is a man. Therefore, John
is a bird.

(b) All birds are animals. Some animals can swim.
Therefore, all birds can swim.

(c) All humans are mammals. Some mammals are
doctors. Therefore, all humans are doctors.

(d) No reptiles are mammals. All dogs are mammals.
Therefore, no dogs are reptiles.

Ans. 1.(b) 2.(b) 3. (c) 4. (d)

Deductive arguments aim to provide logically conclu-
sive support for their conclusions while inductive argu-
ments aim to provide probable or likely support for their _
conclusions.

Deductive reasoning, championed by Aristotle, is
seen as a way to attain certainty and approach the truth.
Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) rightly wrote in the ‘Critique
of Pure Reason’ that Aristotle’s theory of logic completely
accounted for the core of deductive inference. Thomas
Aquinas and Gottlob Frege also made important contribu-
tions in deductive reasoning.

On the other hand, philosophers like Francis Bacon
and J.S. Mill emphasized inductive reasoning as a means
to generate new knowledge. The development of the sci-
entific method, particularly in the works of figures like
Galileo and Newton, further solidified the role of induc-
tive reasoning in scientific inquiry.

First, we try to get the general idea and then difference
between deductive and inductive so that we have some
clarity in mind.

Depuctive REASONING

This set of reasoning moves from a general premise or
premises to a specific conclusion. In deductive reasoning,
if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. We
always aim for certainty in life. It is characterized by a
high degree of certainty.



=== Page 75 ===
6.4

e The structure of a deductive argument often follows
this pattern:
* Premise 1: General statement
* Premise 2: Additional information
* Conclusion: A specific, certain statement that logi-
cally follows from the premises.

Example

Premise 1: All humans are mortal. (General)
Premise 2: Chanakya is a human. (Cause)
Conclusion: Therefore, Chanakya is mortal. (Effect)

General: The first premise is a general statement
about all humans. It says that all humans are mortal.
Cause: The second premise states that Chanakya is a
human. This premise can be seen as the cause of the con-
clusion, because it is the reason why Chanakya is mortal.
Effect: The conclusion is a specific statement about
Chanakya. It says that Chanakya is mortal. This con-
clusion can be seen as the effect of the cause stated in
the second premise.

As we discussed, deductive reasoning is a logical process
that leads to conclusions with a high degree of certainty.
It is a method of thinking that is foundational in the field
of logic.

The example of a valid form of deductive reasoning known
as a categorical syllogism is given as under:

Premise 1: All A are B.

Premise 2: Cis an A.

Conclusion: Therefore, C is a B.

Deductive

Waterfall

Figure 6.2 Deductive vs. Inductive

INDUCTIVE REASONING

e The structure of an inductive argument may look like this

Specific Observations (Causes):
1. Chanakya is a man.
2. Another man, John, is mortal.
3. Yet another man, Sarah, is mortal.

¢ There is always a ‘inductive leap' from certain te

’ uncertain, from particular to general, because th
conclusion tends to contain more information tha
the premises. This leap is based on two:

1. Law of Uniformity of Nature: This says tha,
under similar conditions nature behaves in a sim,
ilar manner — that is future repeats the past.

2. Law of Causation: Every event has a cause, gq
if X is the cause of Y, whenever there is X, it wi
always be followed by Y.

* Observation (or Premise) 1: Specific instance or
data point :
* Observation (or Premise) 2: Additional specific
instance or data 4
* Inductive Conclusion: A general statement or
hypothesis based on the observed instances,

Here is an example of an inductive argument:

Observation 1: All swans that I have ever seen are white.
Observation 2: The swan that I am looking at now is
white.

Inductive Conclusion: Therefore, all swans are white,

re whi necessarily from the premises. Deductive reasoning

r is also provides a high degree of certainty in its conclusions.
If the premises are true and the reasoning is valid, the
conclusion is certain, it is deterministic in nature.
Inductive reasoning offers conclusions based on
observations, which may not provide the same level
of certainty.Inductive arguments are not final but pro-
_ vide working explanations or solutions.

Examples: After observing multiple instances of differ-
ent birds flying, you might induce the general theory
that ‘birds can fly.'

Ifyou observe that every time you water a plant, it grows,
you might inductively reason that watering plants helps
them grow. However, this conclusion is not certain but
probable, it is called as ‘probabilistic’ in nature.

The inductive is based on this principle of uniformity
of nature. This is also known as the principle of the
uniformity of nature, is a fundamental assumption
in inductive reasoning. It is the idea that the natural
world operates in a consistent and uniform manner,
meaning that the same causes will generally produce
the same effects under similar conditions.

EGREE OF SCALABILITY

° Deductive reasoning can be applied broadly to entire
categories or classes of elements.There is no inherent
limit to the number of premises that can lead to con-
clusions. In the example, 'l am a man’ can be extended
to include ‘you are a man,'‘he is a man,’ 'she is a man,'
and so on. Deductive reasoning encompasses the entire
class of elements (the whole class) and leaves nothing
excluded. This deterministic and scientific approach, is
often referred to as 'the science of deduction.

e Inductive reasoning is based on specific observations
and may not encompass entire categories.

Movine FRom GENERAL To SPEcIFIC
¢ Deductive reasoning involves moving from a general
theory to specific premises.
e Inductive reasoning typically moves from specific
observations to broader theories.

ANALYTICAL AND ReFtective Nature
e Deductive reasoning requires deep analytical and
reflective thinking.
e Inductive reasoning relies on observations and experience.

ACCEPTANCE OF PREMISES
e Deductive reasoning accepts premises as true.
¢ Inductive reasoning evaluates the accuracy of prem-
ises and conclusions.

A Priori vs. A Posterior

° Deductive reasoning is a priori in nature, meaning it is
independent of sensory experience and is based on a
prior knowledge that precedes empirical observations.

For example, all sides of a square are equal to each
other is a priori information. This statement is derived
from the definition of a square and is universally true
for all squares, making it a priori within the realm of
geometry. Similarly, side of a right angled triangled
triangle can be calculated with the help of a popular
universal formula. The other examples are Newton’s
Gravitational law, Kepler laws and so on.

¢ Inductive reasoning is a posteriori knowledge that is
based on sensory experience and observations. This is also
called as ‘after experience’ knowledge. The knowledge is
supposed to be acquired after ‘sensory experience’.
Inductive reasoning is innovative because it allows
for the acquisition of new knowledge based on
observations.
Example: Weather forecasting is an example of induc-
tive reasoning where meteorologists use past weather
data to predict future weather conditions based on
probability.

RATIONAL Versus INNOVATIVE

e Deductive reasoning is rational and structured.
e Inductive reasoning is innovative and allows for the
acquisition of new knowledge.

StructTurReD Form

-e Deductive reasoning relies on structured forms like
syllogisms.
e Inductive reasoning is not bound by a specific form.

sions as true or false.Inductive reasoning is a valu-

missing. Inductive actually becomes more important
in real-life situations where saving time takes prece-
dence over absolute accuracy and precision, inductive
reasoning proves to be a practical approach.

Example: An inductive argument about the behaviour
of a certain animal can be evaluated based on the
accuracy of the premises and the conclusion.

INDEPENDENCE From EmpirnicaL Data

° Deductive reasoning is independent of empirical data,
it is not reliant on empirical data or observations.

° Inductive reasoning relies on empirical data and
observations.

UNIVERSAL APPLICABILITY

* Deductive reasoning can be applied universally to
various domains, including mathematics, philosophy,
and science,

° Inductive reasoning is valuable in situations where
certainty is lacking, such as in social sciences.

for the acquisition of new knowledge, making it valuable
in real-life situations where absolute accuracy may not be

are now in a position to discuss their degrees of strength
in separate manners.

In deductive reasoning, an argument can be valid or inva-

the logical structure of the argument, where the conclt-
sion logically follows from the premises.

soundness goes one step further and also requires that the
mises are true. So, soundness involves both validity and

uss bot A Validity is ‘binary’ in nature: An argument is

either valid or invalid, there is no degree in between
dn-scie the two. There are ‘no intermediaries’ between valid
and invalid arguments.

seLvVatio The validity offers the benefits of developing concep-
lased o tual foundation, clarity in logical structure and pro-
$a no gressive learning from one stage to another in deduc-
tive reasoning.

The Methods to Check Formal Validity: These are
'six rules of valid categorical syllogism,’ the ‘Venn
diagram method,' 'nine rules of inference,’ 'ten rules

ured, wh ‘shorter truth table (reductio ad absurdum)' tech-

When we move from validity towards soundness, the
Valid and truth comes into picture. We need to add truth to validity
to make an argument sound. Let’s see, what the truth is ?

Truth (or Falsity): Within a deductive argument, the
individual statements or premises can be classified as
either true or false. In a ‘sound deductive argument’,
in addition to being valid, requires that all premises
be true. If any premise within the argument is false,
the argument may be logically valid but not sound.

_ Truth refers to whether or not the premises and con-
clusion of a deductive argument are actually true. In
other words, a true argument is one in which all of its
premises are true and its conclusion is also true.

* Logical truth: Logical truth indeed depends on the
validity of the logical structure in deductive reason-
ing. Deductive reasoning seeks to guarantee the truth
of its conclusions if its premises are true.

is more applicable in inductive reasoning. Inductive
reasoning typically draws general conclusions based
on specific observations or experiences.

Apptications of Depuctive REASONING

1. Syllogisms: As we discussed that main objective of
syllogism is to get valid form, mainly through deduc-
tive reasoning.

2. Mathematical Proofs: The deductive reasoning is

used extensively to prove theorems and mathematical

statements. For example, a proof that demonstrates

the sum of the angles in a triangle always equals 180

degrees is a deductive argument.

Categorical Propositions: In formal logic, categorical

propositions are used for deductive reasoning. These

types of arguments are deductive because they ensure
the truth of the conclusion when the premises are true.

4. Conditional Statements: Deductive reasoning is also
applied to conditional statements. Let’s look at the
following example:

Premise 1: If it rains, the ground gets wet.

Premise 2: It is raining.

Conclusion: Therefore, the ground is wet.

This is a deductive argument because the conclusion
is certain when the premises are true.

ad

As we discussed, inductive reasoning is ‘probabilistic’ in
nature, the strength of argument is not dependent on the
actual truth of the premises, but on the probabilistic sup-
port given by the premises to the conclusion. The‘strength’
and ‘cogent’ demonstrate the ‘degree’ of ‘inductive reason-
ing’. Keep in mind that ‘probabilty' is a matter of degree.
Collected data (a kind of sample) may also help in this -
what is told by smaller and bigger samples to predict.

Strength: Strength in inductive reasoning pertains to the
degree of support provided by premises for a conclusion.

° It is a probabilistic concept, reflecting varying levels
of support in different arguments.

° This continuum of strength encompasses very strong,
moderately strong, and relatively weak arguments.

° The assessment of inductive strength considers factors
such as the quality and relevance of premises, the sample
size of observations, and the diversity of cases examined.

° It plays a crucial role in scientific inquiry, social sci-
ences, and everyday decision-making.

* Inductive strength enables us to make informed judg-
ments and predictions when complete certainty is
unattainable.

° Strength is a matter of degree, not a binary concept.
Inductive arguments can vary in strength from weak
to strong.

We can explore the concepts of strong and weak further.

Strong inductive Reasoning

Let’s take an example first.

Premise 1: Over the past 100 years, the sun has risen
in the east every day.



=== Page 79 ===
6.8

Premise 2: Tomorrow will be a day.

Conclusion: Therefore, it is likely that the sun will rise

in the east tomorrow.

Astrong inductive argument is one where the conclusion
is more likely to be true based on the available evidence.

The strong arguments are able to achieve their targets in
a convincing manner. The sun rising in the east every day
for over a century is strong evidence that it will likely rise
in the east tomorrow. However, it doesn't provide absolute
certainty due to unforeseen circumstances or exceptions.
One more example of an inductively strong argument:

Premise 1: Most peacocks eat oats.
Premise 2: This bird is a peacock.
Conclusion: Thus, probably this bird eats oat.

This argument is inductively strong because if all of its
premises were true, then it would be highly likely or prob-
able that its conclusion would also be true.

Weak Inductive Argument
Premise 1: Some people from a particular town are friendly.
Conclusion: Therefore, all people from that town are friendly.

An inductive argument is weak when it achieves its objectives.
It fails its objectives. In inductive, it is improbable for the con-
clusion to be false when the premises are true. It emans that
conclusion is not strongly supported by the premise. The fact
that some people from a particular town are friendly doesn’t
necessarily mean that all people from that town are friendly.
The conclusion is a generalization that goes beyond the avail-
able evidence and is therefore considered weak. Recall that
inductive arguments can vary in strength.

COGENCY

Cogency is the final concept that is used to evaluate the
inductive arguments. We should note that cogency con-
siders both the strength of the argument and the truth of
the premises. For an inductive argument to be cogent, it
must have a strong connection between the premises and
conclusion, and the premises must be true.

A cogent argument is persuasive and is likely to be a
good basis for making a decision or forming a belief.

Example: We can take up the same inductive argument.
¢ Premise 1: Over the last 100 years, the sun has
risen every morning.
¢ Premise 2: Tomorrow is a new day.
¢ Conclusion: Therefore, the sun will rise tomorrow.

This argument is cogent because it has both a strong
connection between the premises and the conclusion
(inductive strength) and true premises. While it doesn’t
guarantee the sun will rise, it’s a reasonable and cogent
prediction based on past observations and the assumption
that tomorrow will be similar to previous days.

On the other hand, an uncogent argument is an induc-
tive argument that lacks strength or has unsupported or
less supported premises.

An uncogent argument is not persuasive and should
not be relied upon for making decisions or forming beliefs.

Here, the difference between deductive and inductive ;
play of words, otherwise they are not opposed or cont
dictory to each other. They are rather complementary and
supplementary to one another. They differ mostly in the;,
‘beginning points.

‘Inductive reasoning can be used to generate ne,
hypotheses, but it cannot be used to prove conclusion,
with certainty. Here, the deductive comes into picture
Deductive reasoning can be used to prove conclusions
with certainty, as long as the premises are true. :

Inductive reasoning is also affected by the presence |
negative cases.
Hume called deductive reasoning 'demonstrative’ ang
inductive reasoning ‘probable.' This is because deductive
reasoning is certain, while inductive reasoning is not.

J.S. Mill criticized deductive reasoning as 'syllogism,
He argued that syllogism is simply a restatement of the
premises and does not provide any new knowledge.

Immanuel Kant argued that Aristotle focused on
deductive reasoning because he believed that certainty 0
being closer to the truth is only attained through deduc
tive inference.

Modern philosophers, such as Francis Bacon and
J.S. Mill, focused on inductive reasoning because they
believed that deductive reasoning is powerless to lead to
new knowledge.

Situation 1 (Deductive Reasoning)

¢ Premise 1: All humans are mortal. (Universal premise
° Premise 2: Donald Trump is a human. (Specifi
instance)
° Conclusion: Therefore, Donald Trump is mortal
(Necessarily true)

In situation 1, the premises follow the form of a deduc
tive syllogism, and the conclusion is logically certain 0
deductively sound. If the premises are true, the conclu
sion must also be true. It’s a valid deductive argument.

Situation 2 (Inductive Reasoning)

° Premise 1: All humans who have ever lived are mortal
(Generalization based on past observations)

¢ Premise 2: Donald Trump is a human who has eve
lived. (Specific instance) :

° Conclusion: Therefore, Donald Trump is mortal
(Probable, based on past observations)

In situation 2, the premises are based on inductive rea
soning, and the conclusion is inductively strong. The con
clusion is likely to be true based on past observations am
generalizations but is not necessarily true. It’s an induc
tive argument, and there may be exceptional cases whet
the conclusion doesn’t hold.

Look at the following examples in the same manner.

We are discussing syllogism in a detiled manner now.
Syllogism is a specific form of deductive reasoning, and
they are an essential part of formal logic and critical
thinking. They ensure that conclusions are reached based
on sound and valid reasoning.

Basic Goncepts in SYLLOGISM

Terms

These are the basic units of meaning in a sentence or argy.
ment. For example, in the sentence 'All humans are mo;
tal,' the terms are 'humans' and ‘mortal.'

1. Major Term: This term in syllogism is like a big ideg
or headline of an argument, it is actually general o,
broader term. It is the predicate of the conclusion tha
talks about the subject of the argument. It sums up
the conclusion.

2. Minor Term: This term is also part of the conclusion
and represents the subject, or what the assertion jg
about. It’s the more specific term.

3. Middle Term: The middle term is found in both prem,
ises but not in the conclusion. Its role is to connect the
major and minor terms, creating a bridge that allow
us to draw a valid conclusion.

Premises

We are indeed moving in a reverse manner here. Once we
do the conclusion, now we are dividing them into majo
and minor premises.

Major Premise: This states the relationship between.
the major term (often the predicate of the conclusion,
and the middle term. Sometimes termed as the general .
statement.

Minor Premise: The minor premise relates the minor.
term (the subject of the conclusion) to the middle term.
Sometimes termed as the specific statement.

An Example of Three Terms and Two Premises in a_
Syllogism
The above are interconnected to form a coherent and valid |
deductive argument in a traditional categorical syllo- |
gism. The logical validity of the argument depends on the _
proper linkage and relationship among these elements.

Example:

1. Major Premise: All birds have feathers
2. Minor Premise: Eagles are birds.
3. Conclusion: Therefore, eagles have feathers.

In this example:

® Major Term is 'feathers' (appears in the conclusion).
° Minor Term is 'eagles' (the subject of the conclusion).
* Middle Term is 'birds' (common to both premises).

Terms and premises are linked in a manner that terms can
be used to form premises and also premises can be used
to define terms.

Fallacy of the Four Terms: This occurs in a syllogism
when there are four different terms used, instead of the
standard three terms (subject, predicate, and middle
term). Example: All cats have fur. This animal has fur.

Therefore, it is a warm-blooded creature. Here, there are
four terms: cats, fur, animals, and warm-blooded creatures,
instead of the required three terms for a valid syllogism.



=== Page 82 ===
jbution of Terms: Each term (subject and predi-
e) inthe conclusion should be distributed at least once

e premises. Distribution means that the term refers to
members of a category, not just some.

ddle Term and Moods & Figures: The middle term
,e term that connects the major and minor terms) must
jstributed at least once in the premises.

Moods specify which types of categorical state-

e placement of the middle term within the prem-
5, These help in assessing the validity of deductive
guments and understanding the logical relationships
tween premises and conclusions. They help us to
ntify sound reasoning from flawed arguments.

The first figure was the first to be extensively studied and
malized by Aristotle. First figure helps us in clear and
aightforward evaluation of syllogisms. Moods and Figures
part of syllabus and have been discussed later as well.

{logistic arguments have exactly two premises in medi-
ter inferences. They are often categorized into four
ndard types based on their form:

Categorical Syllogisms: These involve categorical
propositions, such as ‘All humans are mortal.'
Hypothetical Syllogisms: These deal with conditional
statements, like 'If it rains, the ground gets wet.'
Disjunctive Syllogisms: These involve disjunctions,
such as ‘Either it’s a cat or a dog.'

NOTE: Hypothetical and disjunctive are basically
non-categorical or conditional propositions in medi-
ate inference.

ises in Transcendental Syllogisms: These extend beyond the
typical categorical, hypothetical, or disjunctive forms.

zal syllo OPOSITIONS: THE BuiLpING BLocks oF Loaic

‘opositions can be thought of as the Lego bricks of logic.
They are like sentences that let us state things and link
farious concepts. In the language of logic, we consider
iny statement as a proposition.

_ Aproposition is like a puzzle with four pieces:

i. Quantifier: This piece tells us how much or how many
of something we're talking about. It uses words like ‘all,'
'no,' and 'some' to specify the quantity. ‘All’ and 'no' are
the big, general quantifiers, while 'some' is more specific.
Subject (S): The subject represents the focal point of
_ Our proposition, the primary character in our logical
erms cal narrative. In a logical sentence, the subject is the specific
1 be use entity or object under consideration. For instance, in the
statement 'Cats are mammals,' the subject is 'cats.'
Predicate (P): The predicate provides information
about the subject, indicating what action the sub-
ject is performing or what attributes it possesses. It
adds depth and meaning to the sentence. Example:
In the sentence 'Cats are mammals,' ‘are mammals’ is
the predicate, indicating the essential quality (being
mammals) of the subject (cats).

nts are used in the syllogism, while figures define -

6.11

4, Copula: The copula is the connector that links the
subject and the predicate, turning them into a com-
plete proposition.

Though, the standard order is
Subject + Copula + Predicate

Types of Propositions

Propositions are of two primary types: universal and par-
ticular. Universal propositions can be further divided into
two groups:

1. Universal Positive or Affirmative (A): These propo-

sitions are like saying 'yes' to something. They express
inclusion.

¢ Form: They typically follow this pattern: 'All S is
P,' where S is the subject, and P is the predicate.

e Example: 'All cats are animals.' This means we’re
including cats in the big group of animals.

° Distribution: Universal affirmative propositions talk
about the subject. For example, in 'All cats are ani-
mals,' we're referring to cats, but it doesn’t work the
other way around. We can’t say, 'All animals are cats.'

Animals

2. Universal Negative (E): These propositions denote
exclusion.
¢ Form: 'No S is P.’
e Example: 'No fishes are birds' is a universal negative.

e Distribution: Universal negative propositions
exclude both the subject and predicate terms. In the
example, no fishes are part of the group of birds.

Particular propositions also have two parts:
4. Particular Positive (I): These propositions denote
‘partial inclusion,’
¢ Form: 'Some S is P.'
¢ Example: 'Some men are foolish.'

)

* Distribution: Neither the subject nor the predi-
cate is distributed. In this example, we’re only
talking about some men, not all of them, and sim-
ilarly, the term 'foolish' is only affirmed for a part
of the subject class.

B



=== Page 83 ===
6.12

2. Particular Negative (O): These propositions denote
partial exclusion.
¢ Form: 'Some S is not P,' or 'Not every S is P.'
e Example: 'Some birds are not carnivores.
* Distribution: Only the predicate is distributed.

It’s important to note that sometimes the words within
a statement may sound negative, but that doesn’t neces-
sarily make the whole statement negative. Take a look at
these two examples:

‘Shakuni is dishonest.’ 'Telepathy is a non-natural
phenomenon. '

These statements are actually considered positive or affir-
mative, even though they contain words that might seem
negative. So, don’t be fooled by a single word; the overall
statement’s ‘feeling’ depends on the structure. However, we'll
dive into the idea of quantity in a proposition with more detail.

| Conjunction (And): Both must be true. It's true
| only when both parts are true; otherwise, it's false.
| For example, ‘It is raining, And I have an umbrella.’

| Disjunction (OR): False only when both parts are
| false; otherwise, it's true. For instance, I will have
| pizza for dinner OR I will have pasta for dinner’ is
true if you choose either or both.

Conditional (If-then): False only when the first part
is true and the second is false. It expresses a relation-
ship where the truth of the second part depends on
the first. If the first is true, the second must be true;
if the first is false, the second's truth doesn't matter,
Example: Tfit is raining, then SriKrishna will bring an |
umbrella.' This is true if he brings an umbrella when-}
ever it rains or even if it doesn't rain.

CONVERSION OF COMMON STATEMENTS INTO
THEIR Stanparo Locical. Forms

This step depends upon the requirement to do so. In
logical reasoning or syllogism problems, the common
language sentences may have to be converted into their
logical standard form before we can apply logic rules on -
them to draw a conclusion. For example, in a previous
NET examination, the statements (i) ‘only graduates are
eligible for this post’ and (ii) ‘most rickshaw pullers are
graduates’ were given. These types of statements need to
be converted to their logical form, i.e., quantifier + sub-
ject + copula + predicate, as discussed earlier. The rules
of reduction can help in solving these types of problems.

i. A-type Propositions: Statements starting with words
‘each’, ‘every’, ‘any’, etc., are to be treated as A-type
propositions (starting with all).

Note: Sentences with singular term or definite singular
term without the sign of negation are also to be treated
as A-type proposition. For example, ‘Ram is mortal’.

E-type Propositions: Sentences with singular term
or definite singular term with the sign of negation are
to be treated as E-type propositions. Sentences begin-
ning with the words like ‘no’, ‘never’, and ‘none’ are to
be treated as E-type propositions.

5, Exclusive proposition

(a) In exclusive propositions, the subject is qualified
with words such as ‘only’, ‘alone’, ‘none but’, or
‘no one else but’.

_(b) Here, the quantity is not explicitly stated.

(c) They can be reduced toA, E, or I types by first inter-
changing the subject and the predicate, and then
replacing words like ‘only’ or ‘alone’ with ‘all’.

If the exception is definitely specified as in case of, ‘All metals
except mercury are solid’, then the proposition is to be treated
as universal (All non-mercury metals are solid). In case the
exception is indefinite, as in case of, ‘All metals except one
are solid’, the proposition is to be treated as particular.

The nature of proposition depends upon the context
as well. For example, ‘Students are present’ is reduced to,
‘Some students are present’ (I type).

In certain cases, the predicates are qualified by words
such as ‘hardly’, ‘scarcely’, and ‘seldom’, but quantity is
not specified. Such propositions should be treated as par-
ticular negative. For example, ‘Businessmen are seldom
honest’ is an irregular proposition. It is reduced to, ‘Some
businessmen are not honest’.

If such a proposition contains the sign of negation, then

this proposition is to be treated as an I-type proposition.

For example, ‘Businessmen are not seldom honest’ is to

be reduced to ‘Some businessmen are honest’, which is an
I type proposition. This is so because it involves a double
negation, which is equivalent to affirmation.

As we discussed earlier, deductive inference problems are
basically of two types.

1. Immediate inference

2. Mediate inference

IMMEDIATE INFERENCE
Here, the ‘conclusion’ is drawn only from ‘one given
proposition’ in an argument. It means that there are two
propositions in total-one premise and a conclusion. For
example, from ‘all men are mortal,' we can immediately
deduce that some men are mortal. The immediate infer-
ence involves two and only two terms: men and mortal.
Now we want to discuss the different techniques for
immediate inference. The square of opposition provides a
foundational understanding of the relationships between
A, E, I, and O and their logical interplay, truth, false etc.
Once confident, the learners learn conversion, obversion,
and contraposition to manipulate and transform these
propositions for the sake of logical equivalence.

This is also part of immediate inference. We need to look
at diagram 6.1 on page 6.2. Universal mean ‘All’ and ‘No’
are given as subjects in the propositions. Affirmative means



=== Page 85 ===
6.14

positive, it indicates presence. Negative means ‘No’ and
‘Not’ in the above propositions. Particulars means ‘some’.

We have tried to explain the contradictories, contrar-
ies, sub contraries and sub alterations. These have been
put in the diagram as well. A has relationship with E, I and
O. E has relationship with A, I and O. So is the case with I
and O. Their network makes up the square of opposition.
The sqaure of opposition tells us the relationship between
quantiaty, quality or both.

If we take a horizontal split in the middle across the square
of opposition, then A represents Universal Affirmative and E
Universal Negative. Below that split, ‘? represents Particular
Affirmative and O Particular Negative.

Similarly, assume a vertical line Affirmatives and
Negative across on left hand and right hand sides.

4. Contradictory Opposition

These categorical propositions differ from each other
both in quantity and quality. For example, between A
type and O type, A is Universal Affirmative and O is
Particular Negative. Here, Universal and Particular
differ in quantity. Also, Affirmative and Negative dif-
fer in Quality.

1. The same is the case with E (Universal Negative)
and I (Particular Positive) that again differs in
quantity and quality.

2. Two propositions are contradictories if one is
denial or negation of the other. They can’t both be
true OR both be false.

3. The contradictories exist in two forms ~ 1. A and
O 2.EandI

E | No men are honest

Some men are honest

O | Some men are not honest

‘’ in the middle of square of oppostion represents
contradictories, with opposite truth values. This can
be easily remembered.

2, Contrary Opposition
Two universals (A and E) can’t be true together. If A is
given to be True, then E is False. If A is given to be false,
then O will be doubtful. The vice versa is also applicable.

A E

A~ All men are honest.
E—-No men are honest.

Since God (or Truth) is assumed to be at the top of dia-
grams. We assume that God is one, there can’t be two
Gods. In a similar manner, both of the contraries (A and
E) can’t be true simultaneously.

3. Sub-contrary Opposition
Two particulars can’t be true together. If T type is given
, to be True, ‘O’ type is doubtful. If 7 is given to be true,

Subalternation

. Sub-alternation

the other will be false. The vice versa is also applicahy,
This means that both cannot be true simultaneously,

Further, both terms have the same quantity, both ? a,
‘O’ types are particular (same quantity). They differ ,
‘quality’ terms only. For example, ‘TT is of affirmatj,
quantity, then we know that ‘O’ type is of negatjy,
quantity).

Example:
Some men are honest.
Some men are not honest.

When two propositions differ only in quantity (on,
is universal and other is particular), the opposition
called sub alteration.

All men are honest No men are honest

Some men are not honest | I | Some men are honest

That means that A, C and D are part of answer. Thus

overall, (d) is the answer.

O is True—Some Birds are Not Mammals is True
Thus, as per question A, B and D are part of answer.
Thus, (b) is the correct option.

We need to know the following basics for understanding
of conversion, obversion and contraposition

Logical Equivacence Ano MarTeriat EQUIVALENCE

Tautology: A tautology is a statement or proposition that
is always true, regardless of the truth values of its indi-
vidual components. It's like a universal truth, valid in any
possible scenario. This means that no matter what specific
situation you apply a tautology to, it will always be true.

'A rose is a rose is a rose' by Gertrude Stein is a famous
example - a rose is always a rose, no matter how you
describe it or what you call it. Other examples are —“The
sky is blue or it's not blue’ and ‘If I eat pizza, then I've
eaten pizza’. Even light on and light which are linked with
a switch is a good example that tells us that truth values
come in these two situations.

Material Equivalence: First consider, these two exam-
ples, Earth is larger than its satellite Moon’ and ‘New Delhi
is the capital of Bharat’. We can’t replace one with other.
These statements are materially equivalent.

Logical Equivalence:
Example

Statement A: ‘It is not sunny today.’
Statement B: 'The weather is cloudy today.

Now, check their truth values:

° Ifit is sunny today (Statement A is false), State-
ment B is also false because it can't be cloudy
when it's sunny.

° If it is not sunny today (Statement A is true),
Statement B is true because the weather is indeed
cloudy when it's not sunny.

Both statements have the same truth values - both are
true or both are false. The logically equivalent statements

convey the same meaning. If we know one of them is true
or false, we can be certain that the other has the same

truth value. Logically equivalent statements can be sub-'

stituted for each other without altering the meaning or
truth‘of any argument.

Biconditional (If and only if): A biconditional is true only,
when the statements on either side of the tribar (symb
=, which represents the logical connective) have the sam,
_truth value; otherwise it is false. For example: ‘I will atten,
the party if and only if my best friend is also going.’

Negation (Not): Anegation is true only when the negate
statement is false; otherwise the negation is false. A nega
tion has the opposite truth value of the negated state.

of 'It is raining.’ ‘ :

cular Affirmative) propositions. The converse of any
roposition is true if and only if the original propo-
n was true. This means that when you convert an E
roposition, either both the original and the converse
,ositions are true or both are false.

version by Limitation (Subalternation + Conversion)

Jn some cases, a specific type of conversion known as
‘conversion by limitation’ is performed.

This involves first changing a universal proposition to
a particular one through subalternation and then con-
yerting the result.

‘conversion by limitation’ can entail the truth of
an 1 proposition with subject and predicate terms
reversed. For example, if 'All singers are performers,’
then ‘Some performers are singers.’ However, this
works only if there is at least one singer.

imitations of Conversion for A and O Propositions

Generally speaking, conversion is not reliable for A
(Universal Affirmative) and O (Particular Negative)
propositions.

The quality and truth value may change, and the con-
verted proposition may not always accurately repre-
sent the original proposition.

For instance, ‘All cats are mammals’ can be true,
while ‘All mammals are cats’ is false. Similarly, ‘Some
- females are not mothers’ can be true, while ‘Some
mothers are not females’ is false.

¢ Thus, conversion does not provide a reliable immedi-
ate inference with respect to Aand O propositions.

je need to know — Convertend (Original proposition),
‘onverse (New proposition) and Conversion (The pro-
ss itself). Almost similar terms for Obversion and
ontraposition.

lasses and Class Compliments

efore we take on ‘obverse’ and ‘contraposition’, the
ncept of complements is important. The words such
birds, mammals, animals, dogs etc have been used by
earlier. Every class has a class complement (negative

ve)? tribute) associated with it - non-bird, non-mammals,
on-animal, non-dog etc.
animals.’ For example, if we have a class of ‘birds’, the comple-

ent of that class would be 'non-birds' (which includes
erything that is not a bird). The ‘double negation’ rule
will say ‘non-non-birds' that refers to the class of ‘birds’.
Double negation returns to original class. This discussion

ee is important for the obversion and contraposition.
s

~_ Obversion

nals are

Obversion is a fundamental concept in categorical logic,
used to transform a given categorical proposition while
Maintaining its truth value. Note that it involves chang-
ing the quality (from affirmative to negative or vice versa)
and replacing the predicate term with its complement
(discussed in earlier paragraphs).

6.17

The Process of Obversion: Look at the following steps
and examples:

e To create the obverse of a categorical proposition,
reverse the quality and replace the predicate term.
® The subject term remains unchanged.

¢ The quantity of the proposition being obverted also
remains the same.

Examples of Obversion:

‘All birds are animals' becomes 'No birds are non-animals.'
But see the changes:

Original Statement: All insects are mammals.

Universal Affirmative Insects Mammals

Obverted Proposition: No insects are non-mammals.

Non-Mammals

Universal Negative Insects

Similarly
° ‘No birds are mammals’ becomes ‘All birds are
non-mainmals.’
° ‘Some singers are females’ becomes ‘Some singers are
not non-females.’
° ‘Some cars are not sedans’ becomes 'Some cars are
non-sedans.’

Applications

° Keep in mind - We replace the predicate term with
its complement while keeping the subject term and
quantity unchanged.

° Obversion is the only immediate inference that is
valid for categorical propositions of every form.

e Both, the original statements and obverted state-
ments have the same truth values.

© QObversion is the most versatile for categorical state-
ments —A, E, land O.

Contraposition

We switch the positions of the subject and predicate
terms of a categorical proposition while replacing each
term with its complement in this immediate infer-
ence. Contrapositions explores the logical relationships
between different categorical propositions.

Specifically, contraposition can be reduced to the first
two terms ~ conversion and obversion. We can take this
example to show this: Take the O-type proposition: ‘some
farmers are not idealists’. Its logical equivalent is ‘some
non-idealists are not non-farmers’. We can this from the
above: table also. With I-type, the contraposition is not
valid.

PS

In this example, we first perform subalternation (changing a universal to a particular proposition), then switch the

subject and predicate terms and replace them with their complements. Contraposition by limitation works for E proposi-
tions, and the original E proposition entails the truth of the related O proposition. :

Limitations of Contraposition for E and I Propositions: In general, contraposition is not a valid immediate inference
for E (Universal Negative) and I (Particular Affirmative) propositions.
Example 1 (E Proposition): 'No trees are birds' and 'No non-birds are non-trees' may not have the same truth-value.

Example 2 (I Proposition): 'Some lions are carnivores' and 'Some non-carnivores are not non-lions' may not have the:
same truth-value.

Contraposition does not reliably hold for E and I propositions.

What is the purpose of Conversion in logic?

(a) To change the quality of a categorical proposition
from affirmative to negative or vice versa.

(b) To introduce additional terms or elements into a
proposition.

(c) To switch the subject and predicate terms of a
categorical proposition while maintaining the
quality.

terms, while contraposition changes the quality
(affirmative/negative) of the proposition.

words for the same thing.

(c) Contraposition changes the subject and predi-

MetHops oF Mepiatre INFERENCE

Mediate inferences (syllogisms) have three and only
three terms. There are basically two approaches to solve a
syllogism problem, namely

1. Analytical method
2. Venn diagrams

The candidates may prefer Venn diagram method to
analytical method as they find it easier. In this book,
there are many illustrations using both the methods.
As questions are frequently asked from the analytical
method in NET examination, the candidates should
be well versed with analytical method as well.

Candidates are advised not to rely exclusively on Venn
diagrams as they can be ambiguous at times. As many ques-
tions based on theory are expected, analytical method can
reinforce our understanding about the concepts.

The basic steps to solve syllogism problems are

1. Alignment of statements
2. Drawing conclusions

Depending on the nature of the problem, it can entail
two additional steps also. Table 6.2 shows the steps
needed in analytical method for mediate inference.

Steps in Analytical Method for Mediate
Inference Problems

StepII Draw conclusion by use of the table.

StepIV Check for complementary pair if steps II and .
Ill fail.

The requirement of steps I, III, and IV depends upon the

question.

Step I: Alignment of the Propositions —

It consists of two steps. Firstly, make sure that there are
exactly three terms given in both the statements. In case,
the number of terms is different, we need not go fur-
ther, as there will be no conclusion. Secondly, we check
whether the propositions are in standard form or not.

For practical purposes, the following format can be
used as a standard.

A, B, and C used above denote the first, second, and third
term, just for quick representation of terms while solving
practical questions. Please note that this A (used for first
term) is different from A used for universal affirmative.

As discussed earlier, in the conclusion statement, the
first term (subject) is the subject of the first proposition
and second term (predicate) is the predicate of the second
proposition. This fact becomes the basis for the alignment
of propositions.

In case, the problem is in the standard form, we can
directly move to Step I.

If one or both propositions are not given in the stan-
dard format, align them by

1. Converting the first or second statement or both
2. Changing the order of premises

We can make it clear through the following examples.

It is important to remind at this stage that sometimes the
words ‘mostly’, ‘generally’, ‘only’, and so on are mentioned in
one or both the statements. Initially, we convert them into

logical form before doing their alignment, if required,
has been discussed separately under ‘Converting commg
language statements into their logical Form’ on Page 6,9.

These statements should first be converted into logical
forms according to the rules for logical form. tem

As books is the common term, they are in the form A
to B and C to B. The first statement does not require any
change. As the second statement is in particular positive
(I-type), this can be changed to I-type only according to
conversion table given earlier. The second statement will
become, ‘Some books are stationery’.

Now, propositions are properly aligned, i.e., ‘Some
pens are books’ and ‘Some books are stationery’. We now

All chairs are furniture. (A+A =A).

Now, consider Example I as discussed in Step I.

1. Some pens are books. (I-type)

IEA Rule 2. Some books are stationery. (I-type)

‘There can be confusion while aligning a pair of
| statements, where the statement should be given
| priority in terms of conversion. For example, if
there are two statements, A-type and I-type, which
m A to | should be converted so that our purpose of getting
the standard form is achieved? The IEA rule helps
- jn such decision-making.

If first statement given is of A-type and second is
of I-type, then as per IEA rule, the I-type statement
‘should be given priority for conversion. Similarly, in
case of confusion between E-type and A-type, E-type
should be given priority over A-type.

No conclusion as I +I =No conclusion.

Now, consider some examples from NET previous
years’ exams. In each of the following questions (1-3),
two statements are followed by two conclusions, A
and B. Assuming that the given statements are true
even if they are at variance with commonly known
facts, pick up one of the following answer choices
which you think is correct.

(a) If only conclusion A follows.
(b) If only conclusion B follows.
(c) If both A and B follows.

(d) If neither A nor B follows.

tep i: Applying Syliogism Rules

fter ensuring that propositions are in a standard
rmat, we apply syllogism rules to draw conclusions. 1. Some doctors are fools.

After aligning the statements, as per our discussion in 2. He "s a doctor.
tep I, the conclusion may be drawn by using Table 6.3, Conclusions
here the rules of syllogism are mentioned. A. He isa fool.

inations like A +1 or O + A, which have not been men-
oned in the above table. In general, we can say that two
egatives (E+E, E+0O,O+E, or O+0) do not lead to any

Solution: No conclusion can be drawn from the two par-
ticular affirmative propositions. So (A) does not follow.
Second conclusion is the converse of the first statement,
so (B) follows. Hence, (B) is the answer.

rm A to

Universal Positive (A) Particular Negative (O) E+A=0*

Universal Negative (E)

Particular Positive (ID Particular Negative (O) E+I=0*%

niversal Negative (E) _ Particular Nega

*In this case, the flow is from C to A, and not from A to CG, as in all other cases. (Please refer Table 6.3. A, B, and C stand
for first, middle, and second terms, respectively.)

Example 2 Conclusions
Statements A. All crows are not men.
. All birds are men. B. Some men are not crows.

2. All crows are birds.



=== Page 93 ===
6.22

Solution: Consider the following steps.

Step I: The middle term is birds. A close observation indi-
cates that the statements are in the form B to C and AtoB.
After swapping, the statements will become ‘All crows are
birds’ and ‘All birds are men’.

Step Ii: The conclusion should be A + A = A (universal

positive). The conclusion is ‘All crows are men’. So (d) is
the answer.

Example 3
Statements
1. All boats are boys.
2. All boys are larnps.
Conclusions

A. All lamps are boats.
B. All boats are lamps.
Solution: Consider the following steps.
Step I; Statements are in the standard form, A to B and B
to C. The common term, boys, is the predicate of the first
proposition and the subject of the second proposition. So
no alignment is required.
StepIk A+A=A
The subject of the conclusion will be the subject of the first
statement, and the predicate of the conclusion will be the
predicate of the second statement. The common terms
will disappear. So, the conclusion is ‘All boats are lamps’.
Thus, only conclusion 2 follows and (B) is the answer.
Now solving the problem through Venn diagram solution.
According to Statement I, ‘All boats are boys’,

According to Statement I and Statement II, the Venn dia-
gram looks as follows:

Figure 6.5

Looking at the Venn diagram, we can say that second con-
clusion, ‘All boats are lamps’ is correct.

Example 4

Statements
1. All lemons are balls.
2. No bats are lemons.

Conclusions
A. Some balls are not bats.
B. Some bats are lemons.

Solution: By changing the order of the statements itse]
we can align the sentences. The aligned pair is:
No bats are lemons.
So (a) is the answer.
Ali lemons are balls.
E+A=0%. So, the conclusion is, ‘Some balls are not bats

Note: In all the questions discussed previously, Step III an
Step IV are not required as per the answer choices.

Step ill: Checking for immediate Inferences
{lf Required)

We can check the conclusion (or even statements) fo
immediate inference as per answer choices. Usually, j
this case, there are more than two conclusions. Eve
in case of two conclusion questions, we can go fo
this step.
Let us discuss one comprehensive example.

Statements
1. Some tables are chairs.
2. Some chairs are furniture.

Conclusions

I. Some chairs are tables.
Il. Some furniture is chair.
Tk. All tables are furniture.

Choices

(a) I and II are valid.
(b) II and III are valid.
(c) and II are valid.
(d) None of the above.

Example 1.
Statements

Solution: 1+1= No conclusion
Two particulars don’t lead to any conclusion, but after.

So, option (a) is the answer.

Step IV: Checking for Complementary Pair
(If Required)

Check for complementary pairs if Steps II and Ii fail. A
complimentary pair is a pair of contradictory statements,
and both cannot be true simultaneously.

We can call a pair as a complementary pair if:

1. The subject and predicate of both the sentences are
the same.

2. They are +O or A+ O or1+E type pairs, which have

been discussed below.

Gnapshot-Golden Rules of Syllogism
qo sum up all the discussion, some golden rules have
nerged to solve the syllogism problems. These are |
continuity with the earlier discussion.

. Every deduction should contain exactly three
terms.

The middle term (present in both the premises)
must be distributed at least once.

if one of the premises is negative, then the con-
clusion must be negative (will have the words
‘no’ or ‘not’).

{f one of the premises is particular, then the con-
clusion must be particular (will have the words
‘some’, ‘few’, ‘many’, etc.).

. If both the premises are particular, then no con-
_.. clusion can be drawn from the given premises.

6. If both the premises are negative, then no conclu-
sion can be drawn from the given premises.

7, A term that is not distributed in the premises
cannot be distributed in the conclusion.

mples of Mediate and Immediate Inference

All movies are stories.
All stories are surprises.

clusions
All movies are surprises.
Some surprises are movies.

ution: First, let us consider only the statements. The
ntences are already aligned.

Since A+ A=A, the conclusion will be ‘All movies are sut-
‘ises’. Till this point, it is a question of mediate inference.
If we convert this conclusion (immediate inference),
e get, ‘Some surprises are movies’. Hence, both the con-
usions given in the question are true.

IN fail.
atement:

ences are - Some rooms are lamps.

» Some lamps are tubes.

nelusions
- Some rooms are tubes.
- Some lamps are rooms.

Solution: We know that from a combination of I + I, no
mclusion can be drawn.

On converting the first statement, we get ‘Some lamps
€ rooms’, i.e., conclusion (B).

Also, on converting the second statement, we get

nelusions Some tubes are lamps’. This proposition is not given in

2

6.23

the conclusion part. So, in this example, conclusion (B)
alone is true.

Thus, we can see the importance of immediate infer-
ences in solving syllogism problems.

1. Which of the following statements is an immediate
inference from the statement 'All chairs are tables'?
(a) Some chairs are tables.

(b) Some chairs are not tables.
(c) No chair is a table.
(d) None of the above.

2. Which of the following conversion rules is correct for
the statement 'No chair is a table’?
(a) Converse: All tables are chairs.
(b) Converse: Some tables are chairs.
- (c) Obverse: Some chairs are not tables.
(d) Obverse: All chairs are not tables.

3. Which of the following statements is a valid conver:
sion of the universal negative statement 'No chairs are
tables'?

(a) Some chairs are tables.
(b) Some tables are chairs.
(c) No tables are chairs.

(d) No chairs are not tables:

4. In the context of mediate inference, what are the two
basic approaches for solving syllogism problems?
(a) Analytical method and conversion

7. Which one of the following propositions is logically equiv-
alent to the proposition -'some attorneys are logicians'?



=== Page 95 ===
(a) Some logicians are not attorneys.

(b) Some attorneys are non- logicians.

(c) Some logicians are attorneys.

(d) Some non-logicians are not non-attorneys.

8. What is the solution to this question: If the state-
ment ‘no animals are fishes’ is considered false, then
which of the following statements can be immediately
inferred to be true?

A. All fishes are animals.

B. Some animals are not fishes.
Cc. All animals are fishes.

D. Some animals are fishes.

Choose the correct answer from the options given
below:

(a) B and D Only (b) A, C and D Only

(c) Cand D Only (d) D Only

Ans. 1.(a) 2.(c) 3.(c) 4.(d) 5.(d) 6.(c) 7.(c) 8.(d)
Explanations:

The proposition 'Some attorneys are logicians’' means
that there exists at least one attorney who is also a
logician. This is logically equivalent to the proposition
‘Some logicians are attorneys.

If the statement ‘no animals are fishes' is given as false,
then it means that some animals are fishes. Therefore,
only statement D can be immediately inferred to be
true. The other statements are not necessarily true.

For example, statement A (All fishes are animals) is not
necessarily true because some fishes may not be animals
(e.g., dolphins). Statement C (All animals are fishes) is
definitely false because we know that there are animals
that are not fishes (e.g., cats, dogs, humans).

Therefore, the only statement that can be immediately
inferred to be true is statement D (Some animals are
fishes).

Total Moods: There are four types of categorica
propositions (A, E, I, O), and there are three positions
(major, minor, and conclusion) in a categorical syllo-

propositions. So, the total number of possible moods

cally accurate. But practically only a subset of these
is considered valid moods as they produce sound
arguments. There are only four accepted moods (AAI,
AEO, EAE, EAO) as truly valid syllogistic forms. There
are different theories, one of them says that there are
15 valid moods out of total 256.

tives, indicating that the subject is entirely contained
within the predicate category. So, in this case, it means
that all of Socrates (the subject) falls within the cat-
egory of humans (the predicate).

IGURE

he figure in a categorical syllogism refers to the place-
ment of the middle term in the two premises. Figures help
categorize syllogisms based on their structure, enabling a
structured approach to evaluating their validity.

The main features of ‘figures’ are as follows:

1. Arrangement of Terms determines the Figures: This
aspect is very important. Figures tells us how the three
terms, Major, Middle and Minor (respectively rep-
resented by M, P, and S) are distributed between the
major premise and the minor premise. The four stan-
dard figures are Barbara, Celarent, Darii, and Ferio.

2. Specific Distribution of the Middle Term:
Depending on the figure, the middle term can be the
subject of the major premise, the predicate of the
major premise, or both. This distribution influences
the logical structure of the syllogism.

6.25

3. Validity Rules: Each figure has its own set of valid-
ity rules or patterns. Understanding the rules for
each figure is crucial for evaluating the validity of
syllogisms.

4. Mood and Figure: The combination of the figure and
the specific mood (the categorical statements used
in the premises, such as 'All M are P' or 'No S are M’)
uniquely identifies a syllogism.

In traditional categorical syllogism, a 'figure' refers to the
arrangement of the middle term (M), major term (P), and
minor term (S) in the two premises of a syllogism.

These four figures represent the possible arrangements
of terms in categorical syllogisms. The names Barbara,
Celarent, Darii, and Ferio are traditional mnemonics to
help remember these figures.

1* Figure (Mood - Barbara): In this figure, the mid-
dle term (M) is the subject of the major premise and the
predicate of the minor premise. The standard form is as
follows:

Major Premise: All M are P.
Minor Premise: All S are M.

24 Figure (Mood - Celarent): In this figure, the middle
term (M) is the subject of both premises. The standard
form is as follows:

Major Premise: No M are P.

Minor Premise: All S are M.
34 Figure (Mood - Darii): In this figure, the middle
term (M) is the predicate of both premises. The standard
form:

Major Premise: All M are P.
Minor Premise: Some S are M.
4th Figure (Mood - Ferio): In this figure, the middle term

(M) is the predicate of the major premise and the subject
of the minor premise.

Major Premise: No M are P.

Minor Premise: Some S are M.

The arrangement can be understood with the help of fol-
lowing ‘collar type diagrams’ also.

There is no role of ‘conclusion’, and obviously that of sub-
ject and predicate as well.

The specific arrangement of terms in the premises is essen-
tial because it determines whether a syllogism is valid or
invalid. The figure, along with the mood (the specific cat-
egorical statements used in the premises, such as 'All M are
P' or 'No Mare P’), is used to evaluate the validity of the syl-
logism based on established rules of categorical syllogisms.

For example, if you have a syllogism in the first figure and
use the mood 'Barbara,' it means you have premises struc-
tured as described for the first figure and mood Barbara. The
validity of the syllogism is then assessed based on these rules.

The specific arrangement and mood of the syllogism
are crucial in traditional syllogistic logic, and these fac-
tors are not related to any physical shapes but rather to
the logical structure of the argument.

An Example of Moods and Figures:

_ Allcats are mammals. All
mammals are pets. Therefore, all
- cats are pet. |

All cats are mammals. Some
mammals are pets. Therefore,
some cats are pets.

No dogs are mammals. All -

cats are birds.

Benerits of Moops anb Figures

The combination of mood and figure determines the struc-
ture of a syllogism. Not all combinations are valid, and there
are specific rules for assessing the validity of syllogisms,
known as the rules of validity (such as the Rule of the Middle,
Rule of the Major Term, Rule of the Minor Term, etc.).

lacy in an argument is a flaw in the reasoning that
dermines the argument’s logical validity. Fallacies can
ther formal or informal. Formal fallacies are errors in
structure of the argument, while informal fallacies are
ors in the content of the argument. Broadly, the falla-
s may arise due to following reasons:

_ Appeals to emotions

Distractions from the core argumen

Dissemination of misleading information

Hasty generalizations aimed at making forceful
statements

Establishing irrelevant connections

per the NET syllabus, fallacies primarily fall into two
egories: formal and informal, but few others have also
en discussed as there is some mix up.

RMAL FALLACIES

mal fallacies are errors of logic where the conclusion
es not logically follow from the premises. It’s a failure
the structure of the argument.

ey are characterized by invalid deductive arguments,
aning that the premises do not support the conclusion.
Example: 'All rats are black bugs. All black bugs are
nivores. Therefore, all rats are black bugs.' This argu-
nent is invalid because the premises do not logically lead
the conclusion.

_ Logical relationships deal with the structure of ‘argu-
nents and reasoning’, while grammar deals with the
structure of language’.

_ Formal fallacies are errors in reasoning that occur due
0 flaws in the structure or form of an argument. These
Ypes of fallacies are characterized by invalid deductive
€asoning, where the conclusion does not logically follow
tom the premises. There are several main types of formal
allacies:

ns.

enying the Antecedent (Modus Tollens Fallacy):
odus Tollens is a valid form of deductive reasoning that
Sserts if a conditional statement implies a consequence,
nd that consequence is false, then the antecedent (the
hitial condition) must also be false.

zreen' fol-
nood I.
allows the

1. If statement A is true, then statement B is true.
2. Statement A is not true.

From these premises, someone incorrectly concludes:

_ 3. Statement B is not true.

The concrete example is given as under:
Premise 1: If it’s raining (A), then the ground is wet (B).
Premise 2: It’s not raining (A is not true).

Incorrect Conclusion: Therefore, the ground must be dry
(B is not true).

This argument is fallacious because it wrongly assumes

that ifit’s not raining (A is not true), then the ground must.

be dry (B is not true). However, there could be other rea-
sons (e.g., someone watering the ground) for the ground
to be wet even when it’s not raining. The fallacy lies in the
incorrect leap from the negation of A to the negation of B.

Affirming the Consequent (Modus Ponens Fallacy):

Modus Ponens is a valid form of deductive reasoning used
in logic. It follows this structure:

1. If statement A is true, then statement B is true.
2. Statement B is true.

From these premises, we can conclude:
3. Statement A is true.

We can take a more concrete example here:

Premise 1: If it rains (A), then the ground gets wet (B).
Premise 2: It’s raining (B is true).
Conclusion: The ground is wet (A is true).

So, if it’s raining (B is true), then we can logically infer
that the ground is wet (A is true) based on the initial
conditional statement. This is the Modus Ponens form of
reasoning.

Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle: This fallacy occurs
when a shared characteristic is used to draw a conclusion,
but this characteristic is not distributed (present) in all
the members of the groups being compared.

Example: 'All birds have wings. Bats have wings.
Therefore, bats are birds.' This argument is invalid
because not all winged creatures are birds.

Fallacy of the Illicit Process (Illicit Major and Minor):
This type of fallacy happens when there is an improper or
invalid shift of terms between the premises and the con-
clusion in a syllogism.

Example (Illicit Major): 'All dogs are mammals. Fido is a
mammal. Therefore, Fido is a dog.' This argument is inva-
lid because the major term (‘mammal’) is shifted improp-
erly from the premise to the conclusion.
Example (Illicit Minor): 'All cats have tails. Fluffy is a
cat. Therefore, Fluffy has a tail.' This argument is invalid
because the minor term (‘Fluffy’) is shifted improperly
from the premise to the conclusion.

Fallacy of the Exclusive Premises: This fallacy occurs
when both premises in a syllogism are negative. In this
case, no conclusion can be drawn.



=== Page 99 ===
Example: 'No birds are reptiles. No reptiles can fly.
Therefore, no birds can fly.' This argument is invalid
because no conclusion can be drawn when both premises
are negative.

Existential Fallacy: This fallacy arises when a particular
conclusion is wrongly drawn from a universal premise. It
assumes that something exists when it’s not guaranteed
by the premises.

Example: 'All students in the class are intelligent. Jane is
a student. Therefore, Jane is intelligent.’ This argument is
invalid because the premise doesn’t guarantee that every
student in the class is intelligent.

INFORMAL FALLACIES

Informal fallacies are more dependent on the misuse of
language and evidence, and they often involve errors in
reasoning. They can take many forms and are more com-
mon in everyday life. Informal fallacies occur when the
relationship between premises and conclusions is flawed
or when premises are unsound. There is use of Latin
words in many of informal fallacies.

The following are crucial in understanding and identi-
fying informal fallacies.

1. Ethos relates to the credibility of the speaker

2. Logos to the logical soundness of the argument, and

3. Pathos to the emotional appeal used within the argu-
ment.

The various fallacies are as follows:

1. Ad Hominem (Attacking Arguer Instead of Argu-
ment-getting abusive) This fallacy occurs when an
argument attacks the character, motives, or other
attributes of the person making the argument, rather
than addressing the substance of the argument itself.
The excess of this can lead to 'poisoning the well’.

Argument against

the person
Verbally A, = Arguer 1
A, = Arguer 2
(A, commits the
Argument fallacy)

Examples:

e Person A: 'We should invest more in healthcare to
improve the system.

¢ Person B: 'Person A is known to have a gambling
problem, so their opinion doesn’t matter.’

2. Petitio Principii (Begging the Question): This fal-
lacy occurs when the argument’s premises themselves
contain the conclusion in some form, and no further
evidence or reasoning is provided to support the con-
clusion independently. It essentially argues that some-
thing is proven by itself, creating a circular reasoning
pattern. Here, no ‘extra explanation’ is required in the
argument that is hidden within the statement. This

fallacy is sometimes called an immediate argum.

We may agree with the first premise that murder is mor.
ally wrong, the issue lies in the second premise. Not
everyone would accept that abortion is equivalent to
murder. However, in this presentation, the second prem-
ise presumes its validity without adequate support.

3. Hasty Generalization or Sample Size Fallacy: This fal
lacy involves drawing a broad conclusion about a whole
group or situation (generalization) based on a limited or
insufficient sample, without adequate evidence.This is
also known as the fallacy of insufficient statistics.

Example: If someone meets a few rude people froma __

4. Fallacy of Sweeping Generalization (Accident)
This fallacy involves making overly broad statements _
or conclusions about a specific situation or group.
without considering relevant differences, which can.
lead to discrimination and prejudice.

Example: We may say that all politicians are corrupt,
or all lawyers are greedy, but we forget that there may

fallacy may lead to discrimination and preju-
d decisions.

onverse Fallacy of Accident: This fallacy occurs
nen we wrongly apply a rule or idea meant for a spe-
fic situation to all situations, even when they’re dif-
rent. It’s like using a rule in a way that doesn’t fit the
yrent circumstance.

‘ample: Imagine a debate between Socrates and
jemarchus about justice. Polemarchus says justice
about repaying debts. Socrates challenges this idea
_asking if justice also means giving back weapons
u borrowed from a-friend when you know your
end’s mind isn’t clear. If the answer is ‘yes,’ it shows
e ‘fallacy of direct accident.'

rgument ad Populum (Bandwagon Fallacy): This
fallacy occurs when a speech or argument tries to influ-
ence the audience’s emotions, often by evoking strong
feelings like love or hatred, without relying on strong
logical or evidential support. It’s like swaying people’s

opinions based on emotions rather than facts.

Example: In Shakespeare’s ‘Julius Caesar,’ Mark
ization” Antony stirs up the crowd to seek revenge for Caesar’s
: assassination, appealing to their emotions. Similar
emotional appeals can be seen in political speeches.
For instance, the Agniveer Scheme led to violence,
ple fro while a similar scheme in Israel gained public accep-
; _tance. This type of fallacy can occur in various con-
_ texts, including modern-day issues.

_ The 'Bandwagon Fallacy' is a metaphor for people
joining a popular trend, movement, or opinion with-
_ Out proper reasoning.

Argument ad Verecundiam (Appeal to Authority):
This fallacy occurs when someone tries to support
their argument by referring to an authority figure or
expert, even if that authority's expertise isn’t relevant
to the argument.

Appeal to unqualified
authority

causes. If Shahrukh Khan endorses a brand of smart-
phones, it doesn’t make him a smartphone expert.

In simpler terms, it’s when an argument relies on
someone famous to support it, even if that person’s
expertise doesn’t match the topic.

8. Argument ad Misericordiam (Argument from Pity
or Emotions): This fallacy occurs when someone
attempts to win an argument or gain sympathy by
making others feel sorry for them, even if the emo-
tional appeal is unrelated to the issue at hand.

Appeal to pity

A = Arguer

Example:

Imagine a student who didn’t study for an exam.
When confronted by the teacher, they might say, 'I
know I failed, but my cat was sick, and I was up all
night taking care of it. Can you please give me another
chance?' This student is appealing to the teacher’s pity
by mentioning their sick cat, even if it had nothing to
do with their failure to study.

9. Slippery Slope: This fallacy involves assuming that
one action will lead to a series of negative conse-
quences, ultimately leading to an undesirable out-
come in the future, often without considering inter-
mediate events. We may step on a slippery slope for
fun but end result may be accidental.

Slippery slope

Chain reaction
(not likely to occur)

Example 1: Allowing people to drive under the influ-
ence of alcohol at a low level will inevitably lead to
more drunk driving accidents, more deaths, and a
breakdown of society.

Example 2: If sex education is introduced in college,
it’s argued that students will become sexually active,
resulting in a surge of unplanned pregnancies and
sexually transmitted diseases. This, in turn, will force
students to drop out of college, depriving them of
the opportunity to succeed in life. In reality, learning
about sex does not automatically lead to sexual activ-
ity, and it’s unlikely that mere sex education will com-
pel students to drop out.

10. Red Herring (Irrelevant Thesis): This fallacy occurs
when an unrelated or off-topic subject is introduced
into an argument to divert the audience’s attention
from the original issue.

Example: When a teacher catches a student cheating
during an exam, the student might respond by saying,
I acknowledge my mistake, but please consider my
parents. It would be shocking to them." In this case,
the student employs a red herring by appealing to the
teacher’s emotions, attempting to shift focus away
from the real issue of cheating.

. Strawman Argument: This involves misrepresent-

ing or distorting an opponent’s argument to make it
appear weaker or more flawed than it actually is. The
main objective is to attack the weak and defeat that.

Example 1: 'The MP believes that driving a Hybrid car
will miraculously solve all our ecological problems.'

Example 2: 'On the contrary, the MP actually believes
that the environment is in such a dire state that indi-
vidual car choices and driving habits wouldn’t make
the slightest difference.’ In both cases, the opponents
mischaracterize the MP’s true position, making it eas-
ier to knock down the misrepresented argument.

Ignoratio Elenchi (Missing the Point): This fallacy
occurs when the argument deviates from the main
topic or original intention, often due to misrepresen-
tation, introducing irrelevant information, or draw-
ing illogical conclusions.

Missing the point

Example: Imagine a discussion about missing the bus

going ‘astray.

Plurium Interrogationum (Complex Question or.

Loaded Question): This fallacy is frequently encoun-
tered in the legal field and is a deceptive form of
manipulation, often aimed at trapping the accused

or opponents. It involves crafting a question in such
a way that it offers only two possible answers, bo
of which lead to a disadvantageous outcome for th
respondent. The trap is concealed within the que
_tion, making it extremely challenging for anyone to
provide an alternative response.

15. Argumentum ad baculum: This is also known as the
‘appeal to force’ fallacy. This occurs when someone
uses threats or coercion to make their argument seem
valid. For example:

Person A: 'You better agree with my opinion, or else
I'll make sure you lose your job.'

Person B: 'Okay, okay, I agree with your opinion.’
Fallacies Due to Ambiguity

° Ambiguity can lead to fallacies when words or sen-
tence structures are unclear or can be interpreted in _
different ways.

e The main types are as follows:

1. Equivocation (Ambiguous Words): This occurs.
when a word or phrase has’ multiple meanings
or senses, and these different meanings are used
interchangeably within an argument or state-
ment. The ambiguous meanings in different
contexts can lead to confusion. This may happen...
in wordplay, jokes, or deceptive arguments to _
exploit multiple meanings of a word.

2. Amphiboly (Ambiguous Sentence Structure): It
* js an informal fallacy arising from the structure or

coved th syntax of a sentence. Thus, the sentence structure

be made based on how the words are grouped or

rove th arranged. Amphiboly is often the result of poor

vilizatio sentence construction or placement of modifying
phrases. :

Example: 'She told her son that she loved him
more than her dog.' The sentence structure is
ambiguous, and it’s unclear whether the love is
directed more toward her son than her dog or
whether her son is loved more than her dog is
loved.

3. Differing Accent (Emphasizing Different
Aspects): Differing accent ambiguity occurs
when a statement or argument can be interpreted
differently based on the emphasis or accent
placed on different words or aspects of the state-
ment. This type of ambiguity can be related to
spoken language, where changes in emphasis can
change the meaning.

Example: ‘I didn’t say you should clean the
kitchen.’ Depending on where the emphasis is
placed, this sentence can be interpreted as deny-
ing that any instruction was given or emphasizing
the action of cleaning rather than something else.

are ee NDUCTIVE FALLACIES

or state We know that inductive reasoning involves making gener-
differen! alizations or drawing conclusions based on specific obser-
y happe Vations or evidence. ‘False cause fallacy’ happens when we
nents t are creating generalization on the basis of false causes or

Say when there is no existence of such causal relationship.

6.31

Example: 'Every time I wear my lucky hat, my favourite
IPL cricket team wins. Therefore, my lucky hat causes my
team to win.’

‘Occurrence in Historical or Causal Claims: Inductive fal-

lacies, including the 'False Cause’ fallacy, often appear in his-
torical or causal claims. People naturally seek explanations
for events and phenomena. Historians may claim that Indus
Valley or Mesopotamian Civilization declined due supernat-
ural causes such as earthquakes, droughts, or other natural
phenomena, which may not necessarily be the actual causes.

However, inductive logic is often considered to be more
susceptible or vulnerable to fallacies due to their reliance
on generalizations and probabilities, which introduce a
higher degree of uncertainty rather than strict rules and
certainty of deductive logic based fallacies.

(c) Strawman

(d) Appeal to an authority

Ans. 1.(a) 2.(a) 3.(c) 4.(c) 5.(a) 6.(b)
Explanation:

In the term ‘Denying the Consequent,' the word 'deny-
ing' implies the rejection or negation of the conse-
quent, which is the second part or the conclusion of a
conditional statement in a logical argument.

Modus Tollens involves denying the consequent,
where the denial of the conclusion leads to the nega-
_tion of the antecedent in a conditional statement.

Though the question statement seems to be oversim-
plified, it seems that distorts one’s thinking itself, and
unconscious resistance are the result of that criticism
of oedipal complex. This becomes a case of circular
reasoning argument. There is no provision of inde-
pendent or valid support for this assumption. Thus,
the answer is ‘begging the question’. ~

The question statement combines multiple assump-
tions within a single question, making it difficult to
answer without accepting those assumptions.

Ad Populum is the correct answer. This is also known

as the bandwagon fallacy. In this case, the speaker is

trying to persuade someone to attend the party by
suggesting that everyone else is going.

6. The informal fallacy committed in this argument is the
slippery slope. A slippery slope argument is one that
claims that a small first step will inevitably lead to a
chain of related events culminating in some significant
(usually negative) effect. In this case, the argument is
that staying out late, not calling home, and going to wild
parties will inevitably lead to a life that is completely out

-of control.

When it comes to understanding the structure of argu-
ments, there are various key elements and perspectives
to consider. These elements provide insights into the
relationships and characteristics of arguments, which are
essential for sound reasoning and critical thinking. Let us
explore some of these aspects:

RELATIONAL ARGUMENTS

Relational arguments are a crucial component of the
structure of arguments. In these types of arguments, both
the premises and their conclusions are based on relational
propositions. These arguments often revolve around two

main characteristics: the relation of something to itse
and the relation of something to others. In the context o¢
competitive exams like NET, questions about relationa)
arguments are common. Let’s delve into some fundamen.
tal concepts within this domain:

Symmetry

1. Symmetrical Relationship: Symmetry is a concept
where the relationship between two elements works.
both ways. For example, if 'A is equal to B,’ it is algg_
true that 'B is equal to A.' This is a valid and 'symmetrj..
cal relationship.’

2. Asymmetrical Relationship: In contrast, an asym-
metrical relationship doesn’t work both ways. If 'A is
greater than B,' it does not imply that 'B is greater than
A." This is an ‘invalid’ relationship.

3. Non-Symmetrical Relationship: Some relationships
may or may not work both ways. For instance, if 'A is’
the sister of B,' it’s not necessarily true that 'B is the
sister of A.' B could be the brother of A. Whether it’s
valid or not depends on additional information.

Transitivity

1. Transitive Relation: A transitive relation implies
that a relationship travels from A to C through B. For.
example, if 'A is equal to B' and 'B is equal to CG,’ it is
valid to conclude that 'A is equal to C.' This type of
relationship often holds true in various scenarios,
For instance, 'younger to,' ‘precedes,' 'succeeds,' and
‘ancestor of are other examples of transitive relation-
ships.

2. Intransitive Relation: In an intransitive relation, the
relationship does not travel from A to C through B. For.
example, if 'A is the father of B' and 'B is the father of
C,' it’s not valid to conclude that 'A is the father of C.
In such cases, the conclusion is false. Relations such
as 'son of fall into this category.

3. Non-Transitive Relation: In non-transitive relations,
the connection between elements is not straight-
forward. For instance, if 'A is an enemy of B' and 'B-
is an enemy of C,' it’s not necessarily true that 'A is
an enemy of C.' Whether this is valid or not depends
on the specific context. Relations like ‘friend of and
‘neighbour of often fall into this category.

Understanding these aspects of the structure of argu-
ments, including relational arguments, symmetry, and
transitivity, is essential for sound deductive reasoning and
for answering questions related to these topics in exams
like NET.

Let’s explore an example to illustrate these concepts:

Example: In the expression, 'Nothing is larger than itself,’
the relation ‘is larger than’ is:
(a) Antisymmetric (b) Asymmetric
(c) Intransitive (d) Irreflexive



=== Page 104 ===
is example tests your understanding of relational
nts and the characteristics of the 'is larger than’
onship. Choose the most appropriate option based
hat we’ve discussed.

esenting these concepts in a clear and practical man-
tudents can better grasp the structure of arguments
heir real-world applications. Understanding these
jples is not only beneficial for exams but also for
roving critical thinking and reasoning skills.

xiveness
exiveness is a concept that describes the nature of
tionships between different terms. There are several
5 of reflexiveness that can help us understand these
tionships:
Reflexive relationship: This type of relationship
‘occurs when a term is related to itself. It’s like say-
ing something is equal to itself, resembles itself, or is
as old as it is young. For example, when we say, 'A is
equal to A,' this is a reflexive relationship.
Partial Reflexiveness: This occurs when a term
establishes a relationship with something else. For
instance, if 'A is as tall as B, and B is as tall as C,' it
logically follows that 'A is as tall as C.' This concept
involves more than just self-relationships.
Irreflexive: Irreflexive relationships are the opposite
of reflexive ones. In these relationships, a term cannot
relate to itself. For example, saying 'A is smaller than
itself or 'A is west of itself doesn’t make sense. These
_ are examples of irreflexive relationships.
. Non-reflexive: Non-reflexive relationships may or
may not involve a term relating to itself. For instance,
‘A loves itself is a non-reflexive concept because it
may or may not happen. It depends on the specific
context and circumstances.

onnexity is another type of relationship, but this one is
lid between any two terms. For example, when we say
is greater than 2 and less than 4,' this demonstrates
mnexity. Connexity helps us understand how different
rms relate to each other and can be valuable in various
ntexts.

¥pes of Definitions

Definitions are essential for understanding concepts and
fetms in a clear and comprehensive manner. There are dif-
ferent types of definitions that serve various purposes:

. Intensional Definition: This type of definition speci-
fies the properties or features and the meaning of a
term. For instance, in chemistry, water is defined as a
compound of hydrogen and oxygen, while in physics,
it is defined as a liquid with a freezing point of 0°C
and a boiling point of 100°C.

- Extensional Definition: Extensional definitions spec-
ify the class members of a term. For example, when
we define the planets of the solar system as Mercury,

pts:

an itself,’

- 6.33

Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune, we are using an extensional definition.

3. Lexical Definition: Also known as a reportive defini-
tion, a lexical definition is the dictionary meaning of
a term, which is the common vocabulary of a given
language. It helps us understand the basic meanings
of words like 'book' or 'chair.'

4. Stipulative Definition: Stipulative definitions are arbi-
trary and are used to assign new meanings to terms, even
if they already have existing meanings. Idioms and slangs
in language are examples of stipulative definitions.

5. Precising Definition: Precising definitions are devel-
oped to clarify vague or ambiguous terms, often in
fields like law, science, or medicine. For example,
defining a virus as an infectious agent that causes
smallpox is a precising definition.

6. Persuasive Definition: A persuasive definition
attaches an emotive, positive, or derogatory meaning
to a term that may not inherently have such connota-
tions. It is often used as a rhetorical tool in debates or
discussions to influence opinions.

7. Operational Definition: Operational definitions pro-

‘ vide meaning to a term by specifying a measurement
procedure. They are commonly used in scientific and
technical contexts.

8. Functional Definition: Functional definitions specify
the purpose or use of the items denoted by the term.
They explain how something functions or what role it
serves.

9. Ostensive Definition: This type of definition is devel-
oped by showing someone an object and attaching a
word to it. It is often used when a term is challenging
to define verbally, especially for new speakers or in
contexts like colors or sensations.

10. Analogous Definition: Analogous definitions rely on
analogy and correspondence between two different
terms. For example, comparing a brain to a computer
in some particular function or feature is an analogous
definition.

Connotative and Denotative Meanings

Words often have multiple meanings, categorized as ©
denotative or connotative:

1. Denotation: Denotation is the explicit, dictionary
definition of a word. For example, the denotation of
‘home' is 'a place where one lives; a residence.'

2. Connotation: Connotation goes beyond the diction-
ary definition. It includes the emotions, associations,
or ideas that a word evokes. For instance, ‘home’ con-
notes a sense of security, comfort, and family.

Facts, Opinions, Beliefs, and Prejudice
Understanding these terms is important for distinguish-
ing between different types of statements:

° Facts are verifiable and can be supported with evi-
dence.



=== Page 105 ===
6.34

* Opinions are judgments based on facts and can be
debated.
* Beliefs are convictions based on personal faith or values.
° Prejudice is a half-baked opinion based on insuffi-
cient evidence.
By understanding these distinctions, individuals can
critically evaluate and engage with various types of state-
ments and arguments.

Analyticai Reasoning Simplified

Analytical reasoning is a form of logic where you analyze
sentences, groups of sentences, or short arguments. These
might include concepts, facts, theories, and more. You’re
then asked questions about arguments, conclusions, infer-
ences, and implications. To tackle these questions, you'll
use methods like inductive reasoning, deductive reason-
ing, quoting authorities, facts, findings, and illustrations.

Approach

1. Underline important assumptions.

2. Identify supporting arguments.

3. Note the premises of supporting arguments. .
4. Pay attention to the nature of questions.

Types of Questions

1. Assumptions and Statements:

* Assumptions are implied by the associated theory
or argument.

e They can be hidden or explicit.

° Questions may ask which assumption is implicit
in a statement.

* You'll choose from options like ‘Only assumption I
is implicit! or ‘Neither I nor II is implicit.'

Example 1
Statement: A advises B to undergo training for
career success,
Assumptions: I. B sought advice from A.
Il. Experts are more competent.

* Explanation: I might not always be true, but II is-
implied since A recommended training from an
expert.

Force of Arguments

¢ Anargumentis aset of premises leading to aconclusion.
¢ Arguments are valid if the premises, if true, definitely
lead to a conclusion.

Assertion and Reasoning
e These questions have one assertion (A) and one rea-
son (R).
e You determine if A is true and if R correctly explains A.
* You choose from options like 'A is true but R is false’ or

‘Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explana-
tion of A.

Example:

¢ Assertion (A): Tides indicate regular rise and fall
in sea level.

Reason (R): Tides result from the moon’s gravj
tional pull.
Explanation: A is true, and R is a valid explana
tion, so the answer is (c) 'Both A and R are true
and R is not the correct explanation of A.’

Statements and Courses of Action

e A course of action is a step or decision to improve .
situation.

* You decide which courses of action logically follo
based on the situation.

Example:

° Situation: Incessant rains have caused floodin,
due to a silt-filled river bed.

* Courses of actions: I. Transfer people near th
river to safety. II. Inform people about the dangey
III. Remove silt and mud from the river.

¢ Explanation: I and II are immediate action

needed to’save lives, so they follow. III may not b

practical, so it doesn’t follow.

Knowledge is considered to be ‘luminous’ (WAIST) at the.
highest level; knowledge means to illuminate something
‘Truth’ (4@) and ‘knowledge’ (a4) are similar in nature,

After asking, ‘Can I know? (al # a@ GH wera E 2), th
next question is obviously ‘How do I know?’ (4a #S War
etl ?) or ‘What are the sources of knowledge?’ (aM & it

ndia, there are six orthodox schools of philosophy that
ognize the authority of Vedas as divine revelation. Those
0. did not recognize this authority were the Jains and
dhists (both heterodox), and Charvaka (materialists).
here is much divergence of opinion among Indian phi-
phers concerning the nature and scope of Pramana
u| - source of knowledge). Indian philosophy divides
If into three main periods:

Vedic Period (afeaH @Ta): They originated in our
ancient system and can be linked with the ‘Rigveda’
of a very ancient era. The Vedic Age (1500-500
BCE) is the period between the Bronze Age and the
early Iron Age. Vedas belong to the orthodox sys-
tem because they all have recognized the ultimate
_ authority of the Vedas. Vedas were assumed to be
linked with influential Brahmanical thought, which
later met some resistance in the form of Jainism and
Buddhism. It is also related to the Indo-Aryan tribe.
The Vedic period defined the real nature of the soul
or the philosophy about the soul and cosmic prin-
ciple (or Brahman) which represented the ‘ultimate
‘irst an reality’. Its six different darshans are also called
‘Shad Darshan’ (3S af).

The post-Vedic period is a systematic period. Of the sys-
tems of thought or philosophy, six became more famous
than the others. Gautama’s Nyaya, Kinnada’sVishishti,
. realist, Kapila’s Samkhya, Patanjali’s Yoga, Jaimini’s Purva-
Mimamsa, and Badarayana’s Uttara Mimamsa or
Vedanta. All of them accept the authority of the Vedas.

Vedic literature has developed in four phases, with the Ved
s events _ Samhita (@@ ¥fem), Brahmin (SEA), Aranyaka (SRV),
ay occul. and Upanishads (34492) being the key components.

‘ing our

Ved Samhita (a Gea) includes mantras and hymns
and has four main types:

1. Rigveda (8): The Rigveda is one of the oldest
sacred texts in the Indian subcontinent. It is a col-
lection of hymns and praises, often referred to as a
‘song of praise.' These hymns are dedicated to vari-
ous deities and natural forces, serving as a founda-
tional text in Hinduism and providing insights into
the religious and cultural practices of ancient India.

2. Yajurveda (esqd@): The Yajurveda contains a
combination of prose and poetry and is primar-
ily associated with the performance of rituals,
especially the Yagya rituals. It provides instruc-
tions and formulas for conducting these rituals,
making it an essential text for priests and scholars
involved in Vedic ceremonies.

3. Samaveda (@Tae): The Samaveda is character-
ized by its predominant use of song and music. It
consists of melodies and chants that were sung dur-
ing religious ceremonies and rituals. The Samaveda
is closely associated with the melodies used in the
chanting of hymns found in the Rigveda.

4. Atharva Veda (31%d42): The Atharva Veda con-
tains a diverse range of content, with its primary
focus on the Samhita or Mantra portion. Unlike
the other Vedas, it is not primarily associated
with rituals and sacrifices. Instead, it deals with
various aspects of life, including medicine, sci-
ence, philosophy, and incantations for addressing
everyday issues and challenges. It is sometimes
referred to as the 'Veda of magical formulas’ due
to its broader scope of subjects.

The Manusmriti (4q=4fa) is another important text
of Indian practice. It discusses religious, social, and
moral duties.

2. Upanishad period (safe @1€1): During this period,
students took refuge in the Guru to gain the secrets of
knowledge. The Upanishads are believed to have been
composed between 1000 and 800 BC, and possibly as far
back as 600 BC. In this period, there was considerable
development of Yagya culture in North India. The cen-
tral ideas in the Upanishads are Brahman and Atman.

Later Vedic period or Vedanta (Aart @iet): This
era is between about 1400 BC to 600 BC. During
this period, the society was divided into four varnas.
In this period, Brahmins were given more priority
because the responsibility of protecting the Vedas
was considered to be theirs. The Indian tradition of
philosophy is determined by two directions: ‘astika’
(sft) and ‘nastika’ (afer).

The following elements are important in making a clas
sification about the different philosophies:

1. Atheist ($avarét) direction accepts supernatural and
spiritual beings like God, soul, reincarnation, heaven-
hell, etc., while the atheist direction does not accept
these powers.

sad



=== Page 107 ===
2. Only Charvaka philosophy (arate egies) does not
accept any supernatural and spiritual authority, rec-
ognizing only the material world.

3. Buddhism and Jainism accept theories like reincarna-
tion and soul, respectively, but not spiritual beings, so
these philosophies are also called atheists.

4. Nyaya, Vaisheshika, and Mimamsa (24, Sfafitar si

iM) philosophies have been ‘considered realist
under the astik philosophy because they accept both
the spiritual and supernatural and the material world.
Mimamsa philosophy does not accept God.

5. Prakriti (4afA) is also given priority in Sankhya phi-

losophy (Wi@rexi7).

The post-Vedic period is a systematic period that saw -

the development of orthodox systems.

Cuarvaka Mareriatist ScHoo.’s Views oF
KNOWLEDGE (erates silfaes siren free ara)

Rishi Brihaspati Gefs gees) was the founder of this
school. Charvaka is also called Lokayata ( ), which
is the Sanskrit word for ‘worldly ones’ that is the meaning
understood by common people.

As we discussed, ‘pratyaksha’ (Wea) is the only source
of valid knowledge. Only direct perception ‘anubhava’
(S174) is recognized. What we cannot perceive through
senses must be treated as non-existent. They refute all
other sources of knowledge—no mind, no consciousness,
and then no soul. Only the physical body is real.

There are four traditional elements—earth, water, fire,
and air. The validity of inference is also rejected by Charvakas.
Inference is considered to be a mere leap into the dark.

We proceed from the known to the unknown, and
there is no certainty in this, though some inferences may

_ turn out to be accidentally true. Induction is uncertain,
and deduction is arguing in a circle. Deductive inference
is vitiated by the fallacy of ‘petition principia.’

Though we consider invariable association or ‘Vyapti’
(=nft) as the nerve of all inferences, Charvakas chal-
lenge this and regard it as guesswork. Perception does
not approve this Vyapati. Inference and testimony do
not approve it. Charvaka reviews perception as valid and
inference as invalid, as it is the result of inference. The cre-
ations, such as Kautilya’sArthashastra (31 — Science
of Material Gain), are based on it as it is considered to be
a hedonist opportunist approach.

OrtHopox Views of KNOWLEDGE

Nyaya Philosophy (=arzesta)

Nyaya philosophy is very important as per the sylla-
bus. It was primarily given by the sage ‘Gotama’ (dif-
ferent from Bhagwan Gautam Buddha). His creation is
‘Aksapada’(S1a&4@). This school is also known as ‘tarak-
shastra’ ( — science of reasoning), ‘pramanashas-
tra’ (WATMIRIA — science of logic and epistemology), ‘hetu-

vidya’ ( — science of causes), ‘vadavidya’ (arefeen
— science of debate), ‘anviksiki’? (sFtférnt — science of
critical study).

This school is associated with: ‘atomistic Pluralisy;

There are three products of intellectual discriming

Nyaya school, this school also acknowledges perception,
inference, comparison, and verbal testimony as the valid
sources of knowledge.

Sankhya Philosophy (aenesta)

The founder of Samkhya’ philosophy was the famous
sage Kapil. The Samkhya system is also called ‘dualis
tic’ (Saa1e). It believes in Prakriti and Purushartha. The
knowledge consists of three main causative elements: one
who knows the subject, the known object, and the process __

of knowledge. Here are

employ these yoga methods to purify, control, and ulti-

The method is known as Ashtanga Yoga (378i 4m), which _

texts and rituals.

Karma Kanda (#4108): Mimansa places a strong
emphasis on the Karma Kanda (#418), which deals
with rituals (818M) and sacrificial actions. It holds
that these rituals are essential for attaining desired
goals and fulfilling one’s duties (#4).

Hermeneutics (318%€T@): Mimansa scholars developed
elaborate rules of interpretation, known as herme-
neutics (1#a1@), to understand the Vedic texts. They
believed that a precise understanding of the Vedas was
crucial for the correct performance of rituals.

Authority of the Vedas (@@ Warva): Mimansa phi-
losophy strongly upholds the authority and infallibil-
ity of the Vedas. It considers the Vedas as the ultimate
source of knowledge and guidance.

Rejection of Metaphysical Speculation (atfaan

tems like Vedanta and Nyaya, Mimansa tends to avoid
engaging in metaphysical or speculative philosophy.
It is more concerned with practical matters related to

6. Kumarila Bhatta (quiet 4g): Kumarila Bhatta’s
contributions to Mimansa philosophy are highly
regarded. Kumarila defines that valid knowledge is
free from causes and from defects and is not contra-
dicted by subsequent knowledge.

7. Anupalabdhi (3™uUefet): While Mimansa primarily

focuses on the interpretation of the Vedas and ritual

practices, it may not emphasize the concept of 'anupal-
abdhi' (sT7quefs), which is non-apprehension, as a sepa-
rate means of knowledge, as found in Nyaya philosophy.

As per Bhadrayana’s (“1&T) perspective, which is cen-
tral to Uttara Mimamsa (SHIM) and Vedanta (aaia),
knowledge is derived from sacred scriptures (Sruti) and
other authoritative texts (Smriti). Here, 'Sruti' refers to
the Vedas, and 'Smriti' encompasses sources such as the
Bhagavad Gita, Mahabharata, and Laws of Manu.

In the Sankhya (@f€1) philosophy, both the validity
(pramanya - Wa) and invalidity (Apramanya - 31TH")
of knowledge are considered self-evident. Anything that
becomes apparent at a given moment has always existed
in a latent state within.

OvHer Heteropox ScHOOLs oF KNOWLEDGE
Jainism (st)
The word Jain’ is derived from ina’ or ‘jaina,’ which means

the ‘conqueror.’ Jainism and Budhism don’t recognize the
authority of ‘vedas,’ and are heterodox schools of philoso-

‘phy. Jainism came to prominence in the 6th century B.C.,

when Lord Mahavira propagated the religion. There were
24 great teachers (tirthankaras -dtef), the last of whom
was Lord Mahavira. Tirthankaras attained all knowledge
and were liberated (that is called as Moksha -4a). The
first Tirthankara was Rishabnatha. ‘Kalpa Sutra’ (#euqa)
is a biography of numerous Tirthankaras with a primary
interest in Vardhaman Mahavira and Parshvanatha.

Lord Mahavira has given five ‘Mahavrats’ (Great vows -
(Helaa) — truth (Aer), non-violence (‘sf€a?), non-steal-
ing (‘ ”), non-possession (‘STuf4e’), extraversion/celi-
bacy (‘afeaeadysetat’). Three Jewels for ‘Triratna’ are:

6.38

1. Right Faith (Samyakdarshana’ — wWeHeRy),
2. Right Knowledge (‘Samyakjnana’ ~ Wx),
3. Right Action (Samyakcharita’ - wa ait).

Jainism is divided into two categories ~ ‘Digambar’
(feria) and ‘Shwetambar’ (2afaQ. Digambaras worship
the Tirthankaras in a non-anthropomorphic form while
shwetamabar rely on the original Jain scriptures, includ-
ing the Agamas. The latter ones are more liberal in their
approach, even towards women. The ultimate objective of
Jainism is to achieve ‘Moksha’ (Ala ~ the ultimate libera-
tion) chrough ‘Kaivalya’ (aes).

Jains have critically examined the valid sources of
knowledge. Here, knowledge is of two kinds:

1. ‘Pramana’ (WAM) refers to the knowledge of a thing as
itis.

2. ‘Naya’ (1) or knowledge of a thing in its reflection.
It means the standpoint of thought from which we
make a statement about a thing. All truth is relative to
our standpoint. Partial knowledge of one of the innu-
merable aspects of a thing is called ‘naya,’

Both ‘Pramana’ and ‘Naya’ are essential for the full and
true knowledge of a thing. ‘Mediate knowledge’ is any
knowledge which the soul comes to have by the media-
tion of sense organs; any knowledge whose acquisition
involves something other than the soul itself. On the
other hand, ‘immediate knowledge’ is that which the soul
obtains without the intervention of the sense organs.

1. Immediate Knowledge (Getat HT)

(i) Avadhi (a7af&): This is the direct knowledge of
things even at a distance of space or time. It is
called Avadhi or ‘limited’ because it functions
within a particular area and up to a particular time.
It cannot go beyond spatial and temporal limits.

(ii) Manahparyaya (aaaafan: This is the direct
knowledge of the thoughts of others (telepathy),
which is limited to space and time conditions. Both
Avadhi and Manahparyaya are called extra-sen-
sory forms of knowledge, as the soul is unaided by
the senses or mind in obtaining direct knowledge.

(ii)Kevala Jnana (at Ha): This is absolute,
extraordinary, and ‘infinite knowledge. It is
not limited by space, time, or object and can be

acquired only by liberated souls. These thre

kinds of immediate knowledge may be calle,

extra-ordinary and extra-sensory perception,

Avadhi is clairvoyance; Manahparyaya is telep

According to Jaina Epistemology (4 WA wea &
STAN), indirect knowledge is of five kinds:

. Smrti (cafa) — Valid Knowledge

. Pratyabhijna (weafita) — Recognition

. Tarka (ah) — Logic

. Anumana (SPAM) — Inference

. Agama (377PT8) — Words of Reliable People

Here, we can discuss two important aspects.

Gib Whe

1. Naya Vada (Taare): This means a standpoint of
thought from which we make a statement about a
thing. All truth is relative to our standpoints. Partial
knowledge of one of the innumerable aspects of a
thing is called ‘Naya.’

2. Syad Vada or Saptabhangi (tare arzar wa wit):
This is the most important part of Jaina logic. Accord-
ing to this, we can know only some aspects of reality,
and so all our judgments are relative. It is a theory of
the relativity of knowledge—what is true in my eyes
may be wrong in the eyes of others.

The process of practical perception in Jainism is given
as under:

1. Avagrah (2T4%@): Distinguishing the type, horse,
cow, or man, without detailing the main features.

2. tha ($8): Inquiring about whereabouts, country,
direction, etc.

3. Avaya (814): Correct identification.

4. Dharana (807): Recollecting the things popularized __

and keeping them in mind.

Sautrantika (Galfer) says that the external objects are
not known through perception. According to Vaibhasika,
the knowledge of external objects can also be gained
through perception.

According to Vaibhasika, the inference of things exter-
nal to knowledge is self-contradictory. If all the external
objects are inferred by their knowledge, then nothing can
be known by perception. In the absence of perception,
there can be no relation of concomitance between the
major and the minor premise, without which no inference
is possible. This is opposed to actual experience.

The Vaibhasikas accept the presence of the external
things and conceive them as subject to perception. To them,
by Pramana (WAM), only direct knowledge is possible. The
Pramanas (FHM) are of two types, namely Pratyaksa (Yat
Perception) and Anumana (S14 — Inference). Both these
Pramanas (WAM) are known as Samyagjnana (G@20ar —
Right Knowledge), and it is by these that all the purush-
arthas (Jeet — Pursuits of Life) are attained. Pratyaksa
(wea) is the knowledge that is without any imagination
and error. This knowledge is of four types:

1. Indriya Jnana (sat WA) - Knowledge through

senses.

Mano Vigyan (ritfagar) — Sensual knowledge in the

form of samanatarapratyaya (G4rIn Wears- common

mental content) after the knowledge through senses.

3. Self-awareness (Atma Samvedana - 31 Waa):
Thisis the manifestation of chitta (consciousness),
and its attributes are experienced as pleasure and
pain in their true form.

4. Yogic Knowledge (Yogic Jnana —afte% Hr): It rep-
resents the ultimate knowledge of things perceptible
through various Pramanas (valid sources of knowl-
edge). Inference comes in two forms:

* Svartha (For oneself — taa & fet): In this case,
the evidence is inferential. For example, if there’s
a fire on the hill, the hill is the evidence (linga),
and the fire is inferred (anumana). The evidence
remains on the self-side (svapaksha), similar to
a kitchen, without involving the opposite side
(vipaksha), like a pool of water.

There are two major sects of Buddhism:

1. Mahayana Buddhism (neta ager): This branch
regards Gautama Buddha as a divine being who
guided his followers to attain nirvana, the ultimate
liberation from desires and expectations in this birth,
leading to freedom from the cycles of birth and death.

2. Hinayana Buddhism (arrara aitez etl): This sect of
Buddhists considers Gautama Buddha as an ordinary
human being who achieved Nirvana.

Buddhism encompasses three doctrinal principles:

1. Aneeshwarvaad (Atheism — 3Mitsrare a sturaate):
This philosophical position or belief that denies the
existence of God or gods. The followers do not believe
in the authority of God.

2. Anatmvaad (No-Soul Doctrine -— 3t4aTeare): It
asserts that what is commonly referred to as 'soul' is
actually the integral flow of consciousness. Buddhism
uniquely denies the existence of an unchanging, per-
manent self or essence.

3. Kshanikvaad (Momentariness — aftreate): This
doctrine claims that all universal things are momen-
tary in nature. :

The 'Tripitaka' (Three Baskets ~ faftem) is a term used in
many Buddhist scriptures, with much of the Buddhist litera-
ture written in the Pali language. The three pitakas include:

1. Sutta Pitaka (Basket of Discourses ~qa faes): This
section comprises discussions and discourses and is
the largest part of Buddhist teachings.

2. Vinaya Pitaka (Basket of Discipline — fara fireen):
It contains a set of rules and guidelines followed by
monks and nuns to lead a disciplined monastic life
within the Sangha (Buddhist monastic community).

3. Abhidhamma Pitaka (Further Teachings —
fae): It provides a systematic philosophical and, at
times, ‘scientific’ description of the nature of mind,

ComPaRING BupDHISM AND JAINISM

Both Buddhism and Jainism emerged as movements to
reform Hinduism. These religions emphasized using lan-
guages spoken by the masses, such as Prakrit and Pali,
rather than Sanskrit. They are rooted in Vedic religion
and indebted to the Upanishads.

° Buddhism (ag et) centers around the life and
teachings of Gautama Buddha and is polytheistic,
aiming to achieve enlightenment.

° Jainism (3 ef) is also polytheistic, focusing on
non-violence and the liberation of the soul.

Buddhism views life as suffering and seeks to escape
suffering by eliminating desires and ignorance through
the Eightfold Path. Jainism emphasizes respecting all liv-
ing things and attaining liberation by avoiding and shed-
ding bad karma, which causes rebirth and suffering.

PRAMANA (WaruT)-Source oF KNOWLEDGE

The discipline of inference is known as logic, and its pur-
pose is to elucidate the principles governing the process
of making inferences. Inferences represent rule-based

transitions from one or more statements, referred to
premises, to another statement known as the conclusig
A deductive inference aims to be valid, which means ¢
conclusion must be true if the premises are true. All oth
inferences are considered inductive.

Our discussion primarily centers around the Nyaya
(=14) system. Vatsayana defines Pramana as a source 9
means of obtaining valid knowledge. Gautama’s Nyaya
Sutra defines perception as an awareness that: |

percep
owledg

1. Arises from the connection between the sense organ
and the object.
2. Is not derived from words.

3. Does not deviate from its object, meaning it is alway
true.

4. Possesses the nature of certainty.

In any act of knowledge, four essential factors come into
play:

The knower (Pramata ~— WATdT)
The object of knowledge (Prameya -WAa)
The means of valid knowledge (Pramana~ arm)
The result of valid knowledge (Prama —34)

AONE

Knowledge can be categorized into two types:

1. Prama (Valid Knowledge - ¥%): Also known as 'pre
sentative knowledge,' it occurs when the object o
knowledge is directly accessible to the knower. There
are four types of valid knowledge, including percep
tion, inference, comparison, and sabda (verbal testi
mony).

2. Aprama (Invalid Knowledge - 314): This pertains to
the erroneous apprehension of an object and include:
memory (smriti), doubt (smasya), error (viparyaya)
and hypothetical reasoning (tarka).

Hence, pramana is the valid means of knowledge. It ha
four important means:

1. Pratyaksa (44% —Perception)
2. Anumana (144A —Inference)
3. Upamana (Sv4™ —Comparison)
4. Shabda (31s —Verbal testimony)

tyaksha is of two kinds:

ception is considered to be of two types:

the liberating perception of brahman (ultimate real-

thought concept was given by Adi Shankaracharya dur-
ing 8th century CE. He argued that the individual self
or essence (S14I- Atman) is identical to Brahman, and
that the world of appearances (Maya) is an illusion.
Svikalpak - Discriminate perception (afameum) -

ognized. It has a name, color, shape, etc. It provides
direct knowledge of the object. For example, ‘It is a
smartphone,’ 'She is a woman.'

adge. It wledge arises by the contact of sense organs (3faa
indriya) with an object. Such contact is not the sole
ndition of perception, but it is its distinctive feature or
aordinary cause (#RW —karana) of perception.For
ample, when we see a smartphone, our eyes come into
ntact with the light reflected from the smartphone and
nd this information to our brains. Our brains then pro-
ss this information and allow us to perceive the smart-
lone as a distinct object with specific features, such as a
ctangular shape, a black screen, and a camera lens.
The modern school of Nyaya gives a new definition of
‘ception as direct or immediate cognition that is not
‘rived through the instrumentality of any other cogni-
n. It applies to all cases of perception, human or divine.
en God’s omniscience has the highest degree of imme-
acy conceivable.

Perception is divided into the following two categories:

- Ordinary perception (citferm) — Knowledge results

‘means th objects.

each sens - Extraordinary perception (ateilferm) - It has three
e produce distinctions: a. Samanyalakshana (GARI aan) -

Perception of universals/classes. Universals represent

6.41

all the particulars of the class being discussed. b. Jnana
lakshana (3M Ma) - Knowledge traits. For instance,
on seeing the tree of ‘sandalwood (chandan),’ we can
recall its strong fragrance. c. Yogaja (4lT§) - Intuition.
This is extraordinary perception found in gurus and
rishis, involving supernatural powers and intuitive
and immediate perception of all objects, past, pres-
ent, and future.

According to later logicians, there are two kinds of ver-
bal testimony:

1. Vaidika or Alaukika (@f&@ or atime) — Also known
as divine or scriptural testimony. The Vedas are spo-
ken by God. This testimony is considered divine and
perfect.

2. Laukika or secular (ifs or RET) — Known as
secular testimony. Human beings are not perfect, so
only the words of trustworthy individuals can be con-
sidered as laukika.

The former relates to the words of God, while the Vedas
are created by God and are therefore considered perfectly
valid. The latter pertains to the words of trustworthy peo-
ple. According to Nyayikas, since human beings are not
perfect, only the words of trustworthy people can be con-
sidered as Laukika Shabda.

Anumana (3r7aTT — Inference)

The term 'Anumana' indicates knowledge that comes
after earlier knowledge (214 — after, 4 — knowledge).
Inference (314M) is the second source of valid knowl-
edge. It is defined as the knowledge of an object (fet -
lingi) due to a previous knowledge of some sign or mark
(fet - ling). Gautama defines it as a specific form. of
knowledge preceded by perception. The perception of the
invariable relation between the proban (fe - ling) and
the probandum (fe - lingi) is a previous perception of
such a relation somewhere else. Again, the perception of
the proban is invariably related to the probandum as it
exists in the locus. 'Probandum' refers to the matter to be
proven or demonstrated in an argument, discussion, this
can be also be termed as apnigrheet (aTafae) that is yet
to be proven.

Shabda (318% — Verbal Testimony)

According to Nyaya (14) Philosophy, Shabda is the
fourth and last valid source of knowledge. Shabda liter-
ally means verbal knowledge. The mere combination of
words does not provide valid knowledge.

All verbal statements are not valid. Hence, Gautama
defines shabdapramana (UHM) as the statement of
a. reliable person. In other words, verbal testimony is
the communication from a trustworthy person, who is
trustworthy (314 —apta), and why is assertion (S7¢3I —
upadesa) a testimony (WAM — pramana)?

Analyzing the process of verbal testimony, we find the
following steps:

First, there is the perception of the words of a sentence
uttered by a trustworthy person.

Sense of what we’ve seen and heard.

in kinds of inference:

?: This is when we know there’s a gen-
on between two things, like fire (31f4)

6.43

and smoke (4). We’ve noticed that whenever there’s
smoke, there’s fire.

2. Paksadharmata (uerenfat): Here, we infer some-
thing specific, like fire on a hill (4éTS), because we see
smoke there. It’s like saying, 'Where there’s smoke,
there’s fire on that hill.’

In inference, we don’t directly see things; it’s like solv-
ing a puzzle. We use a clue called ‘hetu’ (€@) or a mark to
make our conclusion. For example, when we see smoke
on a distant hill, we remember the general connection
(Vyapti) between smoke and fire and conclude there’s fire
on the hill.

So, we can break it down like this:

1. This hill has fire (pratijna-faanr).

2. Because it has smoke (hetu-@q).

3. Whatever. has smoke has fire, for example, an oven
(udaharana-3aIee).

4. This hill has smoke, which is invariably associated
with fire (upanaya—St4).

5. Therefore, this hill has fire (nigamana—fT)

In Indian syllogism, these five parts are called Avayavas
(aaa)

In Aristotelian syllogism, the character we're figuring
out (fire) is called sadhya; the clue (smoke) is the hetu,
and the subject (hill) is paksa. It’s like major, middle, and
minor terms.

Linga Paramarsa (fei wrist): In Nyaya syllogism,
we have five terms. The middle term works as a bridge
between the major and minor terms and plays a crucial
role in proving a syllogism is right or wrong. This connec-
tion between the middle term and major term is called
linga-paramarsha.

There are five qualities of a middle term:

Vyapti (Invariable Relation — euft): Vyapti means
there’s always a connection between the middle term and
the major term. For example, where there’s smoke, there’s
always fire. But remember, not everything with fire has
smoke, like a red-hot iron ball. Vyapti can be of two types:

1. Samvyapti (teat): When two things are always
together, like ‘nameable’ and ‘knowable.’ If something
is nameable, it’s also knowable.

2. Asamvyapati ( ): When two things aren’t
always together, but one is linked to the other. Fire is
always where there’s smoke, but the reverse isn’t true.

Naiyayikas icc) say there are five ways to establish Vyapti:

1. Anvaya (Agreement in Presence - 3171): Vyapti is
when two things are always together.

2, Vyatireka (Agreement in Absence - @fate): The
clue and what it points to should be absent together.

3. Vyabhicaragraha ( ): No instance contra-
dicts their connection; they are related.

4. Upadhinirasa (Elimination of Condition - 3arf

): Vyapti is a universal and necessary relation-

ship, and extra conditions can’t mess it up.



=== Page 115 ===
5. Tarka (Hypothetical Reasoning -a&): It’s an indi-
rect way to understand Vyapti. All the methods men-
tioned are direct, but reasoning helps us think logi-
cally to figure it out.

6. Samanyalakaa Pratyaka (Gar Haat Weal): Some-
times, when we see one instance, we understand all
other instances related to it.

Vyapti- Another Inference Classification

Inference is classified based on the nature of the connec-
tion (Vyapti) between the clue (smoke) and what’s inferred
(fire). It’s all about the relationship, whether it’s a cause-
and-effect relationship or not. There are three types:

1. Purvavat Inference (Wat 3T{ATT): We figure out
something we haven’t seen (like future rain) from
something we have seen (like dark, heavy clouds).
Sesavat Inference ( ): We guess some-
thing we haven’t seen (like past rain) from something
we have seen (like fast, muddy river water).

3. Samanyatodrasta Inference ( STAT):
This is different. We don’t rely on cause and effect. We
just notice things happening in a pattern. For exam-
ple, we see the moon in different places over time,
so we conclude it moves even if we haven’t seen the
actual motion.

Mipp_e Term (am or fei)

In ancient Indian philosophy, the middle term is a critical
component of logical reasoning and inference and is used
to demonstrate the logical relationship between the sub-
ject (minor term - Wat) and the conclusion (ate#- major
term) through the presence of a specific characteristic or
concept (middle term).

The middle term is a fundamental concept in Indian
logic and is used to establish a connection between the
major term (M1®4) and the minor term (4&1) ina syllogism.
The breakdown of these terms is given as under:

Major Term (tie): The major term represents the con-
clusion or the statement you want to prove or infer. For
example, in the case of 'The hill has fire,’ the major term
is ‘fire’ (S11).

tw

Minor Term (a): The minor term represents the subject |

or the specific case in which you want to establish the con-
clusion. In our example, the minor term is 'the hill' (4ers).

Middle Term (a@& or fei): The middle term acts as a
bridge or connector between the major and minor terms.
It is a concept or characteristic that links the major and
minor terms. In our example, the middle term is 'smoke'
(44). The presence of the middle term (smoke) is used
to demonstrate the connection between the major term
(fire) and the minor term (the hill).

The purpose of the middle term is to establish a logical
connection, often called Vyapti (fa), between the major
and minor terms. This connection is essential for valid
inference. In Indian logic, a valid syllogism or inference
depends on the presence of the middle term to establish
this connection.

Hetvasuasa (Ancient BHARATIYA FALLACY
System - @arata)

Hetvabhasa is an ancient Bharatiya Sanskrit term th
translates to 'fallacy' in English. In the context of Bharat;
logic, Hetvabhasa refers to a fallacious or invalid ar

ment. In other words, it’s a situation where the midd
term seems to be a reason but is not a valid reason to sy
port the conclusion. All fallacies in the ancient system a
considered 'material (silfaam a aredfaen) fallacies.'

Features of a Valid Middle Term

To have a valid middle term, it must meet the followin,
conditions: ;

1. Presence in the Minor Term (aareratat): The middle
term must be present in the minor term. For instance
in the case of the argument, 'The hill has fire,' the mj
dle term, such as 'smoke,' must be present in the hill.

2. Presence in All Positive Instances (aueTeTg
The middle term should be present in all (positive)
instances where the major term is present. For exam.
ple, if we say, ‘Fire exists in the kitchen because it has
smoke,' then the middle term 'smoke' must be present
where there’s fire.

3. Absence in All Negative Instances (fauat
Conversely, the middle term should be absent in a
(negative) instances where the major term is absen
For instance, if there’s no fire in a lake, then 'smoke’
should also be absent in the lake.

4. Non-Incompatibility with the Minor Term
( stanfért): The middle term must not prove something
contradictory, especially concerning the minor term
For example, it should not demonstrate the coolness.
of fire if that’s not the intended conelusion.

5. Absence of Counteracting Reasons (aaa
The middle term must not be contradicted by other
reasons that lead to a contradictory conclusion. I
other words, there should be no conflicting evidence
that disproves the middle term’s validity.

Types of Hetvabhasa

1. Asiddha (stftg): This is the fallacy of the unproved
middle. The middle term must be present in the minor
term, but if it is not, it is unproved. This type of fallacy.
has three subtypes:

(a) Ashraya asiddha (31314 31f&z): The minor term is
the locus of the middle term, but if the minor termis
unreal, the middle term cannot be present in it.

(b) Svarupaasiddha (tarey sifeg): Here, svarupa
(S467) means 'own form’ or ‘essential nature’. In
this case, the minor term is not unreal, but the
middle term cannot be its very nature and be.
present in the minor term.

For example, Sound is a quality because it is.
visible. Let us look at the following terms



=== Page 116 ===
1. Minor Term: 'Sound' - This is the subject of
our argument.

. Middle Term: 'Quality' - This is the term being

used to establish a link between the minor

term (sound) and the major term (visible).

Major Term: ‘Visible’ - This is what the

argument is trying to prove about sound.

3.

In the given example, the fallacy occurs because
the argument wrongly asserts that sound (minor
term) is a ‘quality’ (middle term) because it is 'vis-
ible’ (major term).

Vyapyatva asiddha (earera sift): Here, the
Vyapti (relation) is conditional, and thus, the
middle term becomes fallacious when applied to
cases where the condition does not hold.

_ Savyabhichara or Anaikantika (aeafitrert or

aiatfeades ): This is the fallacy of the irregular middle.

It can be further categorized into three types:

(a) Sadharana (eT): In this case, the mid-
dle term is too wide, and it is taken as a ‘mixed
land,' being present in both positive and negative
instances. This violates the rule that the middle
term should not be present in negative instances.

¢ Example: Claiming 'The hill has fire because it
is knowable' is an example. Here, 'knowable' is
present in both fiery and non-fiery objects.

(b) Asadharana (31TetewoT): Here, the middle term
is too narrow, being present only in the 'paksha'
(minor term) and nowhere else. This violates the
rule that the middle term should be present in the
‘sapaksha' (positive instances).

(c)

it is audible' is an example. ‘Audible’ applies
only to sound and nowhere else.

Anupasamhari (3tudert): The fallacy of
Anupsamhari (non-exclusive middle term) occurs
when the middle term of an argument does not
cover all of the members of the minor term. In this
case, the middle term 'knowable' does not cover
all of the members of the minor term ‘all things.’
Some things, such as numbers and concepts, are
knowable but eternal. The minor term is all-inclu-
sive and leaves nothing as sapaksha or vipaksha.
° Example: Claiming ‘All things are non-eternal
because they are knowable' is an example. This is
an example of a non-exclusive middle, where the
minor term is all-inclusive and leaves nothing as
sapaksha or vipaksha.

(c)

nit . Satpratipaksha (aafaaer): This fallacy involves

two terms, 'sat' and 'pratipaksha.' The middle term is

ature’. contradicted by another middle term, and both have
, but the equal force.

» and be ° Example: Claiming ‘Sound is eternal because it

is audible' and 'Sound is non-eternal because it is

use it 1 produced' is an example. Here, 'audible' is counter-

balanced by ‘produced,’ and both have equal force.

¢ Example: Asserting 'Sound is eternal because -

° Badhita (aft): We usually say in routine lan-
guage in India that our journey was ‘badhit' by a
traffic jam.The patient’s recovery was 'badhit' by a
series of infections. Here, ‘journey’ and ‘recovery’
are middle terms and these objectives were inter-
rupted or prevented.

The Sanskrit word ‘badhit' (aft) means 'obstructed,'
‘interrupted,’ or ‘prevented.’ It is used in Indian logic
to describe a fallacy that occurs when the middle
term of an argument is contradicted by direct percep-
tion or a piece of stronger evidence.

Example 1: All birds can fly because they have wings.
Penguins have wings. Therefore, penguins can fly.
The middle is ‘wings’ in this argument. However,
we know from direct perception that not all animals
with wings can fly. Therefore, the middle term is
contradicted and the argument is fallacious.
Example 2: Stating 'Fire is cold because it is a
substance’ is an example. Here, the middle term
'substance' is directly contradicted by perception.

4. Viruddha (fae): This is the contradictory middle,

where the middle term, instead of being connected
to the major term, is connected to the absence of the
major term. It proves the non-existence of the major
term in the minor term.
Example: Asserting 'Sound is eternal because it is pro-
duced!’ is an example. In this case, 'produced' doesn’t
prove the eternality of sound; instead, it proves its
non-eternality.

(d) Some frogs are not amphibians.

Ans. 1.(b) 2.(b) 3.(b) 4.(d) 5.(e) 6.(c)
Explanations:

4. This statement contradicts the middle term 'substance'
because it attributes the quality of 'cold' to the sub-

°

stance ‘fire,' which is a contradiction, making jit Fi
example of the Badhit fallacy according to Nyaya (cla
sical Indian school of logic). The correct answer is (c)

The Svarupasiddha fallacy is a fallacy in which the
middle term of an argument is incompatible with the.
minor term. In other words, the middle term canny,
be a part of the minor term.

In the argument 'Sound is a quality because it is Vis.
ible,' the middle term is 'visible.' However, sound can.
not be visible. Sound is an auditory sensation, while
visibility is a visual sensation. Therefore, the middie
term is incompatible with the minor term, and the
argument is fallacious. 4
If the proposition 'No frogs are amphibians' is given as
false, it means that there are frogs that are amphib.
ians. This leads to the immediate inference. The cor.
rect answer is (c).
