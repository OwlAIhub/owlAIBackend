Title: Understanding Communication: Importance and Diversity

Text:
=== Page 1 === % iad s eeaeiesren === Page 2 === In a classroom, the contents are delivered to the learners through the process of communication. The word ‘com- munication’ derives from the Latin word ‘communicare,’ which means ‘to share,’ emphasizing the notion of making things common. As we are living in a complicated world, we need to take a ‘diverse’ perspective of communica- tion. Oxford University Press defines communication in precise, comprehensive, and academically oriented man- ner. They emphasize the exchange of information, ideas, or feelings between people through speaking, writing, or using some other medium. Little’s definitions are known for being concise and accessible, for them communication is defined as the act of conveying information and ideas between indi- viduals, whether through verbal, written, or non-verbal means. The ‘technical definition’ of communication covers the transmission and reception of signals or messages through a medium, such as spoken words, written text, or visual images to share the information. Psychological definition focus on the use of mutually understood signs, symbols, and semiotic rules. Digital communication focus on digital formats such as email, and social media tools. Interpersonal communication covers two or more people. Business definitions include company, customers, stake- holders, or the public. Above all, human beings are social animals, they have diverse set of dynamic needs. So is the. diversity in our communications. At its highest level, communication involves building strong, trusting relationships with individuals whose per- spectives differ significantly from our own. We have an innate impulse to communicate with each other for the betterment of society and personal development. The Basic Aspects of Communication: Théy are as follows. 1, Prioritizing our Senses in Communication: Com- munication goes beyond words; it involves our bodily gestures, facial expressions, and eye contact.

Summary:
Communication is the process of sharing information, ideas, and feelings between individuals through various mediums, emphasizing the importance of diverse perspectives and building strong relationships.

sic Aspects of Communication: Théy are as follows. 1, Prioritizing our Senses in Communication: Com- munication goes beyond words; it involves our bodily gestures, facial expressions, and eye contact. Listen- ing is equally vital in this world, as everyone desires to be heard, often seeking feedback. 2. Signs and Symbols in Communication: Communication is a complex system that utilizes signs and symbols. Signs: A ‘sign’ is an object or figure representing a specific reality, such as the red colorsignaling ‘stop’ in traffic. On the other hand, a ‘symbol’ conveys an abstract idea linked to societal conventions. For example, a red rose symbolizes love and affection. Symbols: as Vygotsky posited, are acquired in social contexts, internalized, and used to share meaning with others. They serve as cognitive tools for con- structing our understanding of the world. The study of word relationships is known as ‘syntactics.’ _Effective Communication: Feedback is an essential element of effective communication as we always seek clarity. Effective communication is the clear and successful exchange of information or ideas that leads to mutual understanding and desired out... comes. It relies on key elements such as active lis. tening, empathy, non-verbal cues, timely responses, _ adaptability, respect, conciseness, and goal-oriented interactions. 4, Modern Age Communication: Today’s communica. | tion is marked by speed, efficiency, and the ability to transcend physical and geographical boundar. ies. Communication occupies 70% or more of our © time spent. This prominently includes Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram), Video Conferencing (Zoom, Skype, Google Meet), Mass Media, Blogging and Vlogging, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), Podcasting, discussed | in Unit 8. Key Features of Communication 1. Continuous and Dynamic: Communication is an ongoing, action-driven process with specific objectives, 2. All-Pervasive: Information flows in various direc- tions within an organization, including top-down, bottom-up, diagonal, and horizontal channels. 3. Two-way Process: Effective communication includes.

Summary:
Communication involves prioritizing our senses, utilizing signs and symbols, feedback, and modern technology to achieve effective and continuous exchange of information in various directions within an organization.

All-Pervasive: Information flows in various direc- tions within an organization, including top-down, bottom-up, diagonal, and horizontal channels. 3. Two-way Process: Effective communication includes. a feedback loop to ensure understanding and acknowledgment. 4. Context and Relationship: The way a message is delivered, including content and tone, significantly influences its effectiveness, with emotions and feel- | ings often affecting grammar. 5. Symmetry and Complementary: Cormunication exchanges can be based on either similarity (symme- try) or differences (complementary), depending on characteristics. 6. Common Language: Using a shared language enhances mutual understanding and communication effectiveness. 7, Meeting of Minds: Effective communication relies on the recipient comprehending the intended message. 8. Substance of the Message: A message’s significance depends on the recipient’s interest-in the. subject matter. 9, Gestures as Communication: Communication extends beyond words to include non-verbal elements like gestures, facial expressions, and body language. 10. Different Types of Communication: Communication can be formal or informal, verbal or non-verbal, each with its unique characteristics and contexts. 11. Always Within a Context: Communication takes place within a framework encompassing physical, social, psychological, and temporal dimensions that influence its meaning and impact. === Page 3 === the clea or idea tired out ictive lig sponses -oriented Adjacency Pairs An adjacency pair is a concept in the field of con- § versation analysis, which is a branch of sociolinguis- | tics.

This helps in fostering good citizenship. Participation in Governance and Democracy: So that people participate in political processes. They help in safety and emergency situations, innovation and Creativity, healthcare, personal well-being. Viacro FuNcTIONS OF COMMUNICATION Emotive Function: They used to convey emotions and inner states of mind, such as expressions like ‘Oh My God!’ or ‘Oh no!’ - Directive Function: They to influence the behaviour of others, typically through requests or commands, like ‘Fetch me a glass of water, please.’ Phatic Function: They primarily serve to establish, acknowledge, or reinforce social relations and to ensure the channel of communication is functioning, e.g., ‘Hello, is it Ram?’ or ‘Can you hear me, Mrs. Girdhar?’ Poetic Function: This focus on the aesthetic and artistic aspects of language, emphasizing the mes- sage itself, like the use of euphony for pleasant speech sounds, for instance, ‘Asoka The Great.’ Referential Function: They are used to convey infor- mation and facts, essentially referring to the literal meaning of the message. Metalinguistic Function: They focus on the language code itself, often used in discussions about language, grammar, or dictionaries. Contextual Function: They set the tone and creates a particular context for communication, such as ‘Right! Let’s start the meeting now.’ Heuristic Function: Language is employed to gain knowledge, explore, and learn about the environment. It often involves asking questions and seeking answers. Additional Functions 1. 2. Denotation: Denotes the literal, dictionary definition of a word, without emotional or associative meanings. Connotation: Refers to the emotional or associa- tive meanings and suggestions connected to a word, alongside its denotative meaning.

Summary:
Communication serves various functions in society, including facilitating economic activities, fostering good citizenship, participation in governance and democracy, emotive, directive, phatic, poetic, referential, metalinguistic, contextual, and heuristic functions, as well as denotation and connotation.

Connotation: Refers to the emotional or associa- tive meanings and suggestions connected to a word, alongside its denotative meaning. Simile: Compares two dissimilar objects using words like ‘as’ or ‘like,’ creating a comparison, e.g., ‘my boy- friend is like a watermelon in the summer.’ Metaphor: Compares two dissimilar objects without using ‘as’ or ‘like,’ implying a direct resemblance, e.g., ‘my boyfriend is an angel.’ These functions help us understand the various purposes and nuances of communication in different contexts. === Page 4 === EVOLUTION OF COMMUNICATION The communication evolution is connected with the pro- gress of mankind, related technologies and by transcend- ing physical or geographical boundaries. It impacted speed, efficiency and ability of communication. Now there is globalization of communication. Prehistoric Communication ° Non-verbal communication: facial expressions, ges- tures, body language, and vocalizations. ° Cave paintingson cave wails: often depicting animals, hunting scenes, and other aspects of prehistoric life. ® Petroglyphs: These are images carved into rock surfaces. Ancient Communication - © Writing: use of symbols to represent words and ideas. The first writing systems were developed in Mesopota- mia and Egypt around 3500 sc. ¢ Cuneiform is one of the earliest known writing systems, originating in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) around 3200 scz. Cuneiform consists of wedge- -shaped characters or symbols made by i impressing a stylus into clay tablets. ® Hieroglyphics is an ancient Egyptian writing system with its roots dating back to around 3200 scr. Hiero- glyphics are pictorial characters that represent objects, concepts, and sounds. They are often displayed in a combination of images and symbols. ° Smoke signals: technique to send messages over long distances by creating smoke with fires. ° Carrier pigeons: These birds were used to carry mes- sages between people. Medieval Communication ° Printing press: mass-production of books and other printed materials, which resulted in dramatic increase in literacy rates.

Summary:
The evolution of communication has progressed from prehistoric non-verbal methods to ancient writing systems like cuneiform and hieroglyphics, and later to medieval advancements such as the printing press, impacting the speed, efficiency, and globalization of communication.

Medieval Communication ° Printing press: mass-production of books and other printed materials, which resulted in dramatic increase in literacy rates. The name of Johannes Gutenberg’s invention of the printing press in the 15th century can be associated with this. ° Postal service: This government-run organization delivered letters and other mail to people throughout the world. Modern Communication ° Telegraph: This invention allowed people to send mes- sages over long distances using electrical signals. ° Telephone: This invention allowed people to communi- cate with each other in real time over long distances. We can associate the name of Alexander Graham Bell’s with the invention of the telephone in the late 19th century, ° Radio: This invention allowed people to broadcast mes- sages to a wide audience. ° Television: This invention allowed people to watch moving images and hear sound transmitted over long distances. ° Computers: These machines have revolutionized com. munication by making it possible to send and receive mes- sages, information, and data instantly over long distances, During the 21st century, the technologies have made it _ possible for people to communicate with each other in new and innovative manners through the internet, social media and mobile devices. These have been discussed in detail in eighth unit of ICT. PERSPECTIVES ON COMMUNICATION Here is a brief overview of each perspective that reflects some evolution of communication also: ° Mechanistic viewpoint: The communication is precise and flawless transmission of a message from the sender to the receiver. It focuses on the technical and structural aspects of the message exchange. ° Psychological aspect: This perspective views com- munication as going beyond the message itself to encompass the receiver’s emotional response when interpreting the message. It recognizes the profound’ impact that emotions and psychological factors have on effective communication. Social constructionist perspective: This perceives communication as a product of interactants collabora- tively sharing and creating meaning from messages.

Summary:
Throughout history, communication has evolved from using birds to carry messages to modern technologies such as the printing press, telegraph, telephone, radio, television, and computers, ultimately allowing people to communicate instantly over long distances through the internet, social media, and mobile devices, with different perspectives on communication including a mechanistic viewpoint, psychological aspect, and social constructionist perspective.

cal factors have on effective communication. Social constructionist perspective: This perceives communication as a product of interactants collabora- tively sharing and creating meaning from messages. It contrasts with the ‘transmission model,’ which portrays | communication as a mechanical, computer-like process. Systemic outlook: The communication is a dynamic system in which individuals interact through symbols to generate and interpret meanings. New messages are formed through a process called ‘throughput,’ and they evolve as they travel through the communication network, Critical approach: The communication is a source of power dynamics and potential oppression of individuals and social groups. Examining communication through this lens provides a framework for understanding how communication is shaped within the boundaries of spe- cific theories, shedding light on issues related to power, social structures, and inequalities. === Page 5 === SENDER Receiving Information ISSERTIVE COMMUNICATION the modern fast-paced world, where we frequently ncounter challenging situations and time constraints, ultivating an assertive communication style is essen- 1.

nication, particularly in persuasive contexts like public speaking, seminars, and lectures. It has the following ele- ments. 1. Sender, speaker or ‘rhetor’: Being ‘rhetoric’ is the art of persuasion. They begin the communication. Their role is to convey a message to the audience, with the purpose to persuade, inform, or entertain. So, their effectiveness depends on their ability to present their message in a clear, engaging, and convincing manner. 2. Message: The message is the core content deliv- ered by the sender. Its effectiveness is determined by its clarity, organization, relevance, and persua- sive power. Clarity means easily understandable and thus avoiding any ambiguity or confusion. ‘Persuasive Power’ means that message is compelling, capable of influencing or engaging the audience. Being relevant Various communication models serve as essential tools for evaluating and enhancing the flow of information over time. They also provide guidance for future com: munication practices. These models offer a mechanistic perspective on human communication, focusing on the flow of information as a primarily one-way transmission process. Analyzing the relationships among differen; variables is crucial for improving communication effec. tiveness. Alex Fish has introduced three key communication models: Leagan’s Model _ Barnlund’s Transactional Model of Communication 1955 Rogers and ee Model 1953 Becker’ s Mosaic Model 1957 = Constitutive Metamodel 1967 Frank Dance’s Helical Model means that message addresses the interests, needs, or concerns of audience. 3. Audience (listener or rhetorician): They interpret, understand, and respond to the message, thus they play a crucial role in the success of communicator or say overall communication process. Aristotle empha- sized the importance of tailoring the message to the specific needs and interests of the audience. Aristotle also introduced three persuasive techniques to enhance communication effectiveness: 1. Ethos: Credibility of the speaker, building trust and authority. / 2. Pathos: Emotional appeal to connect and persuade the audience. 3. Logos: Logical reasoning using facts and rational arguments.

Summary:
Effective communication in persuasive contexts like public speaking relies on the sender's ability to convey a clear, engaging, and convincing message to an audience, with a focus on clarity, organization, relevance, and persuasive power, while also considering the audience's interpretation and response, as well as utilizing persuasive techniques such as ethos, pathos, and logos.

Text:
1. Ethos: Credibility of the speaker, building trust and authority. / 2. Pathos: Emotional appeal to connect and persuade the audience. 3. Logos: Logical reasoning using facts and rational arguments. Overall, Aristotle’s model is basic, linear and it doesn’t account for the complexities of modern, multi-channel, and interactive communication. The focus is on audience, and it fits into traditional or contemporary settings. Lasswell’s Model (1948) This model views communication as the transmission of a message with a measurable impact on the receiver’s behaviour. This model is also known as the ‘Lasswell === Page 7 === ormula,’ is a simple and widely used communication odel that focuses on five key questions related to com- ial tools munication: rmatioy 7 re com. hanistic 3 On the mission lifferent m effec. Who? (Sender): Who is the source or sender of the message? 9. Says What? (Message): What is the content of the message? 3. In Which Channel? (Channel): Through which channel or medium is the message transmitted? 4, To Whom? (Receiver): Who is the target or receiver nication of the message? Shannon-Weaver model of Communication (1949): This model provided us a visual model of communica- tion in context of electronic media (telegraphed com- munication). It is also known as ‘Mathematical Model of Communication’. These are the following three main aspects in communi- cation: 1. Technical Aspect: This ensures the accurate transmis- sion and reception of the message. 2. Semantic Aspect: This ensures the clarity and correct interpretation of the message’s meaning. 3. Effectiveness Aspect: This ensures the message has the desired impact or influence on the receiver. eeds, or iterpret, tus they cator or empha- e to the Noise: This refers to any external or internal interference that disrupts the clarity and effectiveness of the message transmission and reception. This can include physical dis- turbances, like background sounds, as well as psychologi- cal factors, such as misinterpretations or preconceived notions. Norbert Wiener addition of feedback changed the model from a linear to a cyclical model, which more accu- rately reflects the nature of human communication. _.

Summary:
Aristotle's model of communication focuses on ethos, pathos, and logos, while Lasswell's model emphasizes the sender, message, channel, and receiver, and the Shannon-Weaver model includes technical, semantic, and effectiveness aspects with the addition of feedback by Norbert Wiener.

With What Effect? (Effect): What is the intended or actual effect of the message on the receiver? Two Points to be noted down: .° ‘Who’ and ‘To whom’ denotes situation depending upon human sciences. e ‘Says what’ and ‘With what effects’ denotes physical sciences. These communication models play a critical role in assessing information flow and promoting more effective communication practices, making them valuable tools for communication analysis and improvement. Received Figure 4.2 Shannon-weaver Information Model 2. Positive Entropy: This signifies growing disorder, confusion or uncertainty in the message. It means that the information is becoming less structured and more random. Higher entropy can lead to signaling errors, making it crucial to maintain the desired level of entropy. 3. Relative Entropy: This is the ratio of the actual entropy of a message to the maximum possible entropy. It helps assess how close a message is to the highest level of disorder or randomness. A balance between order and randomness is impor- tant for effective communication. (b) Redundancy: The extra and unnecessary informa- tion in a message makes communication less efficient. ‘High Redundancy’ means there’s too much repeated. and unnecessary stuff in a message, which can be con- fusing. So we need to avoid redundancy by using key information and simple language.

Summary:
Norbert Wiener's addition of feedback changed the communication model from linear to cyclical, reflecting the nature of human communication more accurately, with key points to consider including entropy, negative and positive entropy, relative entropy, and redundancy in order to promote effective communication practices and avoid confusion.

efficient. ‘High Redundancy’ means there’s too much repeated. and unnecessary stuff in a message, which can be con- fusing. So we need to avoid redundancy by using key information and simple language. For example, we may say ‘midnight’ instead of ‘twelve midnight.’ (c) Channel capacity: This means the maximum amount of information that can be transmitted through a com- munication channel in a given unit of time. Beyond this capacity, communication may experience errors or degradation in quality. This helps to minimize errors and ensure information is accurately transmit- ted. Channel capacity is more applicable in interper- sonal communication, where the focus is on one-on- one interactions. Berlo’s S-M-C-R model Bold (1960) This model initially is a Sender-Receiver model, has been expanded to include Source, Message, Channel, and Receiver (S-M-C-R Model). This model portrays commu- nication as a linear process without feedback or the con- sideration of noise or barriers. === Page 8 === Social system Culture Communication | Seeing Communication skills Elements| Structures skills Hearing 7 Attitudes Attitudes ETE | Touching | -————_—__ Knowledge Knowledge | Smelling Social system Culture J Tasting Figure 4.3 S-M-C-R Model Inreractive MopeL. of ComMUNICATION The term ‘interactive’ in communication denotes a two- way process in which both the sender and receiver actively participate. This dynamic occurs because feedback is inte- gral to the process, serving to clarify messages, confirm understanding, or offer additional information. Essen- tially, interactive model represents two-way, non-linear communication. Because of interactive exchanges, feed- back and specific contexts of being cultural, social and physical, this is also called as the convergence model. Field of Experience: Communication styles differ based on cultural backgrounds and personal experiences. Peo- ple interpret messages through the lens of their own expe- riences, influenced by culture and social context. Misun-. derstandings can occur when these differences aren’t acknowledged, making awareness crucial in diverse inter- actions.

Summary:
The S-M-C-R model emphasizes the importance of avoiding redundancy in communication and highlights the interactive nature of communication, where feedback and individual experiences play a significant role in understanding messages.

ens of their own expe- riences, influenced by culture and social context. Misun-. derstandings can occur when these differences aren’t acknowledged, making awareness crucial in diverse inter- actions. Example: An American, accustomed to direct communi- cation, may find a Japanese person’s indirect approach evasive, while the Japanese might perceive the Ameri- can’s bluntness as rude. This can lead to misunderstand- ings due to their differing communication styles. Noise: This, in the form of interference or distractions, can disrupt the communication process, but it is consid- ered an external factor rather than an integral part of communication. Figure 4.4 Schramm Communication Model Types oF Interactive MopeLs Osgood-Schramm Circular Model (1954): This model makes an addition to Shannon and Weaver's model. This is built upon the shared roles of sender and receiver in effective communication which may be termed as reciprocal roles. Due to continuity of such roles, a feed- back loop is created. It considers the elements such as the field of experience, encoding and decoding, redundancy, feedback, and noise. This model is more straightforward and easier to comprehend, making it versatile for various communication scenarios. Schramm’s Advanced Model of Communication (1997): This model provided a more sophisticated and compre- hensive framework. This acknowledges communication through various channels, including verbal,- nonverbal, and technological means, ° There is inclusion of noise sources like environmental factors and cultural differences which disrupt mes- sage encoding and decoding.

Summary:
Different communication styles and cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings, emphasizing the importance of awareness and understanding in diverse interactions, as demonstrated by the Osgood-Schramm Circular Model and Schramm's Advanced Model of Communication.

Newcomb’s Model (1953) nae Te; Newcomb’s model shows three parts: the sender, receiver, verbal’ nd society, highlighting how communication keeps soci- averbal, ty balanced. ° This model is used to study different types of commu- imental nication, like changing attitudes, persuading, resolv- pt mes- ing conflicts, building relationships, and more. ul back © ‘Recursive’ means that something happens again and se inter again, like making a bad situation worse. ffective: : Westley and Maclean Model (1957) This model builds on Newcomb’s Model. This looks at tts, and ‘gatekeepers, environment, culture, and personal factors which offer different viewpoints on communication and make it better. It helps understand mass communication in society and culture. Watzlawick Model (1967) There are five basic axioms: 1. Even when we are silent or trying to avoid commu- nication, we are still communicating something. For example, if we are sitting in a meeting with our arms crossed and a frown on our face, we are communicat- ing that we are unhappy or disinterested. Figure 4.5 Katz's Model 2. Every communication has a content and a relation- ship dimension. 3. The nature of a relationship is determined by the punctuation of the sequences of communication between the participants. 4. Human communication is both digital and analog. Digital communication: words, written language, numbers, symbols Analog communication: tone of voice, facial expres- sions, body language, gestures, eye contact, proximity 5. All communication is either symmetrical or complementary. The success of this model focus on the integration of internal realities (mainly physical and social contexts), individual experiences, nonverbal cues, field of experi- ence, group dynamics. : | Robert T. Craig’s Metamodel (1999): Craig has | given ‘Communication As a Field Model’. This met- amodel is beyond linear, interactive and transac- tional. This has adopted an integrated approach. | Craig model views communication as a dynamic | process in which participants actively shape the | meaning of messages.

Summary:
Various communication models, such as Newcomb's, Westley and Maclean's, Watzlawick's, and Robert T. Craig's, offer different perspectives on how communication functions and influences relationships, society, and culture.

Rhetorical: The practical art of discourse 2. Semiotic: The mediation by signs 3. Phenomenological: The experience of dia- logue with others 4. Cybernetic: The flow of information 5. Socio-psychological: The interaction of individuals 6. Socio-cultural: The production and reproduc- tion of the social order , 7. Critical: A process in which all assumptions can be challenged === Page 10 === Suirt TOWARDS TRANSACTIONAL MopeLs The shift began in the mid-20th century. The transition from interactive to transactional communication models has occurred across various fields such as technology, psy- chology, and education, as outlined below: 1. Role of Technology: Transactional models became prominent with the technologies, with internet also added to it. This facilitated direct communication and reflecting global cultural shifts. 2. Impact on Education: This change is evident in edu-. cation, with a greater focus on interactive learning and joint content creation. 3. Psychological Approach: Interactive models in psy- chology mostly focused on stimulus-response, view- ing individuals as separate. In contrast, transactional models see communication as a dynamic, collabora- tive process. THE TRANSACTIONAL MopeL This model emphasize the dynamic, reciprocal, and context-dependent nature of communication. The main points are as follows: 1. Simultaneous Sending and Receiving: Unlike earlier models, the transactional model gives equal treatment to all the parties in the communication process. They are considered as ‘sirnultaneous’ senders and receivers, engaging in a constant exchange of messages. 2. Dynamic and Continuous: Communication is viewed as an ongoing, ever-changing process influenced by the interactions and relationships between communicators. 3.

Summary:
Craig's transactional model of communication emphasizes the interactive and dynamic nature of communication, with participants actively shaping the meaning of messages through a collaborative process, and has been adopted in various fields such as technology, psychology, and education.

Dynamic and Continuous: Communication is viewed as an ongoing, ever-changing process influenced by the interactions and relationships between communicators. 3. Shared Field of Experience: Effective communica- tion in the transactional model depends on the over- lapping experiences, backgrounds, and perceptions of the communicators, which shape understanding and meaning. 4. Context-Dependent: The communication is influ- enced by the surrounding context, including social, cultural, and environmental factors. 5. Feedback and Interaction: Feedback is integral and continuous, allowing for constant adjustment and mutual influence within the communication process. 6. Co-Creation of Meaning: Meaning is not simply transmitted from sender to receiver but is collabora- tively constructed through interaction. 7. Influence of Noise: The model considers both exter- nal noise (physical disturbances) and internal noise (psychological or emotional barriers) that can affect the communication process. Leagan’s Model (1961) This model designed for ‘extension education,’ has the fol- lowing points: 1. Skilled Communicator: The successful communica- tor can effectively convey a useful message. 2. Proper Channel: This ensures that the message reaches the intended audience effectively, 3. Effective Treatment: This is required to resonate | 4. Audience: Understanding the audience and their 5.

Externally, it covers emails, websites, let- ters, contracts, and more, which help communicate with others outside the organization. The benefits of written communication are that we can edit messages before sending them, creating a per- anent record for reference. It also ensures the receiver fully understands the message and allows for appropriate feedback. But it can lack immediate responses and some- times takes longer than speaking. In real life, we often use Mnemonics: Aids for Better Memory Mnemonics are memory-enhancing tools used to learn and remember words, numbers, facts, and more in arious situations. These tools are particularly helpful or recalling longer lists, such as characteristics, steps, stages, or parts of something. Research by Gerald R.

Gestures or Body Language: Gestures involve bodily movements, particularly involving the hands or head, to express ideas or meanings. Examples include waving, pointing, or using hand gestures while speaking. Different gestures may indicate ask- ing a question, displaying anxiety (like biting nails), or greetings. It’s advisable to avoid pointing at peo- ple with fingers or bending the head while listening or greeting. 4. Touch: Communication through touch includes actions such as shaking hands and patting on the back to convey approval or reward. 5. Space: Maintaining physical distance between indi- viduals during communication is essential. 6. Eye Contact: The way people look at someone can convey their level of interest, anger, or other emotions. 7. Paralanguage: This aspect involves how people speak, encompassing the tone, speed, and volume of their speech. Speaking too fast may indicate hap- piness, excitement, or nervousness, while speaking slowly may suggest seriousness or sadness. Non-verbal communication can be further categorized into two main groups: static and dynamic features. Here’s a breakdown: Static Features ° Distance: The physical distance between individuals can convey messages related to attraction, status, or the intensity of the exchange. * Orientation: How people present themselves, whether face-to-face, side-to-side, or back-to-back, can signify cooperation, competition, or other aspects of their interaction. ° Physical Contact: Actions like shaking hands, touch- ing, hugging, or patting on the back can indicate inti- macy or a sense of attraction. ¢ Posture: The way individuals position themselves is a significant aspect of non-verbal communication. Dynamic Features ° Facial Expressions: Expressions like smiles, frowns, raised eyebrows, yawns, and sneers convey emotional information and are continuously monitored during interactions. ° Gestures: Hand movements and gestures are com- monly used during conversations. While some gestures === Page 14 === have universal meanings, many are individually learned and idiosyncratic.

While some gestures === Page 14 === have universal meanings, many are individually learned and idiosyncratic. ° Eye Contact: A crucial element of social communica- tion, eye contact can convey emotions, signal conver- sation cues, or indicate aversion. The frequency of eye contact can suggest interest or boredom. Visual Communication: Enhancing Ideas Through Images Visual communication is the use of visual aids to con- vey ideas and information in formats that can be seen or read. It encompasses two-dimensional images, including signs, typography, drawings, graphic design, illustrations, colors, and electronic resources. Eight Types of Non-verbal Communication Non-verbal communication comprises eight distinct types, each with its own set of non-verbal signals that can enhance loyalty and rapport in interpersonal interactions: 1. Proxemics: Proxemics refers to the use of personal and physical space to convey non-verbal messages related to intimacy, affection, aggression, or domi- nance. The spatial relationships between individuals can significantly affect communication. 2. Paralinguistic: Paralinguistic elements are the non- verbal aspects of speech that complement the spoken words. These include the timing, pace, tone, loud- ness, pitch, volume, rate, quality, intonation, inflec- tion, and vocalized pauses in one’s speech. 3. Kinesics: Kinesics involves various body signals that amplify the meaning of communication. These sig- nals include gestures, eye contact, facial expressions, posture, locomotion, and haptics (touch). The inter- pretation of these signals can vary across cultures. 4. Haptics: Haptics pertains to the way touch is used to communicate. Different reactions may arise from unsolicited touch, and cultural norms play a role in determining acceptable touch behaviours. Examples include a gentle touch on the forearm, a two-handed handshake, or a slight kiss on the cheek. 5. Phonemics: Phonemics is a linguistic aspect of non- verbal communication, focusing on the distinctions - made by sounds in a particular language.

Summary:
Non-verbal communication includes gestures, eye contact, proxemics, paralinguistic elements, kinesics, haptics, and phonemics, all of which play a crucial role in conveying emotions and enhancing interpersonal interactions.

Phonemics: Phonemics is a linguistic aspect of non- verbal communication, focusing on the distinctions - made by sounds in a particular language. Phonemes are the units of sound that differentiate one word from another within a language. 6. Dress and Appearance: The meaning conveyed through dress and appearance varies depending on the situation and context. Clothing and grooming choices can send both intended and unintended mes- sages to those receiving the communication. 7. Chromatics: Chromatics involve communication through the use of colour. colours of clothing, prod- ucts, or gifts can convey specific messages to the recipients, whether consciously or subconsciously. 8. Iconic: Iconic systems are employed to represent words or linguistic concepts through symbols or icons. Examples. include different types of ‘emoti- cons’ used to convey ideas and emotions in written communication. Codes: In communication, codes are consistent rules for replacing a piece of information, such as a letter, word, or phrase, with a selected equivalent. Codes are used to con- vey messages efficiently and can vary between different forms of communication. Communication Impact: As per Mehrabian According to Mehrabian, communication can be broken down into three aspects: ° Words contribute 7%. ° Tone of voice makes up 38%. ° Body language accounts for 55%. These percentages are often referred to as the 7/38/55 rule, and they are also known as the ‘3 V’s’ - Verbal, Vocal, and Visual. In practice, effective communication com- bines both spoken and non-verbal elements.

that visual elements are particularly crucial for grabbing attention CLASSIFICATION: BASED ON Purpose AND STYLE These can also be taken as the main categories of com- munication. Formal Communication. Formal communication is characterized by the structured flow of official information through predefined channels and routes within an organization. Several key points about formal communication include: 1. Controlled Flow: Formal communication is controlled and regulated, requiring deliberate efforts to ensure accurate and appropriate information exchange. This structured approach helps maintain order and consis- tency in organizational communication. === Page 15 === 9, Hierarchical Structure: It typically follows a hierar- chical structure and a chain of command. Information primarily flows from senior to lower-level employees. This ensures that each employee knows their role and responsibilities within the organization. 3, Obligation to Follow Channels: Employees are obligated to follow formal communication chan- nels when performing their duties. This adherence to established protocols is essential for maintaining _ order and avoiding confusion. 4. Communication Tools: Formal communication utilizes a variety of tools and methods to transmit information. These may include memos, intranet platforms, meetings, conferences, formal one-on-one interactions, bulletin boards, handouts, letters, pre- cules for sentations, speeches, notice boards, organizational word, or blogs, emails, and more. 1 to con. Examples: Specific examples of formal communica- lifferent tion include a department head conveying information to their team through a memo, an organization’s top management addressing employees in a formal meet- ing, or a principal communicating with an assistant professor through the head of the department (HoD). In essence, formal communication is a structured and controlled mode of information exchange that plays a crucial role in maintaining order and ensuring that rel- evant information is disseminated through established _ channels within an organization.

Summary:
Visual elements are crucial for grabbing attention and can be classified based on purpose and style, with formal communication being characterized by controlled flow, hierarchical structure, obligation to follow channels, and the use of various communication tools to transmit information within an organization.

Each individual in a cluster network can further transmit the information. ¢ Probability Chain: This form of informal commu- nication involves individuals randomly sharing the same piece of information with other individuals. The information spreads through the organization in an unpredictable manner. Overall, informal communication is a flexible and organic mode of information exchange that complements the formal communication structures within an organiza- tion. It allows for quick, diverse, and often more personal interactions among employees. CLASSIFICATION ON THE BASIS OF DIRECTION Vertical Communication 1. This is basically formal communication. 2. This can be upwards (bottom-up) and downwards(top—bottom). Lateral or Horizontal Communication 1. Involves communication with peers and colleagues at the same hierarchical level. 2.

Varies in intensity depending on an organization’s culture and structure. Diagonal Communication 1. Hierarchy Bypass: Diagonal communication elimi- nates hierarchical boundaries, allowing information to flow freely across different positions and status levels. 2. Relationship Building: It helps foster relationships and bonding between superiors and subordinates, promoting better collaboration and understanding within the organization. Communication Network 1. Chain Network: This type follows a formal chain of command where members communicate with each other in a predetermined sequence, resembling a bureaucratic organization. 2. Wheel Network (STAR Network): In this network, information flows. from one central member to the rest. It’s akin to a star, where all communication is channeled through a central supervisor, which can be less effective for team communication. === Page 16 === 3.

People seek balanced beliefs to avoid cognitive dissonance. ¢ Perceptual differences based on social group status are termed ‘standpoint theory.’ Personal Influence Theory * Interpersonal relationships, not mass media, signifi- cantly influence people. ° Opinion leaders play a crucial role in transmitting media information to others. Sociological Theories of Mass Communication ¢ Cultivation Theory by George Gerbner (1967): This effect occurs when people watch a lot of TV, especially fictional shows. They start thinking and believing things they see on TV. ¢ Mean World Syndrome: If we watch a TV loaded with violence and crime, we might start thinking the world is more dangerous and violent than it actually is. Mainstreaming: When many people watch TV, they all start to think similar things, no matter where they come from or who they are. They become homogeneous. ° Agenda Setting Theory emphasizes media’s role in shaping what people think about. -¢ Uses and Gratification Theory posits that audiences actively engage with media based on their preferences and previously held beliefs. ¢ Dependency Theory recognizes factors that prevent media from exercising arbitrary control. ° Spiral of Silence Theory explains how people modify their views to avoid isolation, and it emphasizes the importance of free expression. ° Diffusion of Innovation Theory focuses on the com- munication process for new ideas. Normative Theories of Mass Media e Authoritarian Theory advocates media subordination to state power and ruling class interests, often involving advance censorship and punishment for deviation. Free Press Theory, also called Libertarian Theory, is based on the principle of individual freedom of expression. ° Social Responsibility Theory suggests that the free market fails to fulfill certain societal obligations, and the media should serve information, social, and moral needs. ¢Communist Media Theory envisions media under the control of the working class, ruling out private ownership.

Summary:
Various theories of mass communication, including Cognitive Dissonance Theory, Standpoint Theory, and Cultivation Theory, explain how individuals interpret and are influenced by media messages based on their preferences, social group status, and exposure to TV content, while normative theories such as Authoritarian Theory, Free Press Theory, and Social Responsibility Theory propose different approaches to media regulation and control.

Title: Cultural Concepts and Leadership Roles in Group Communication

Text:
oup ComMuNICATION There are many cultural concepts discussed here, they are considered as part of group communication because they can have a significant impact on how groups interact and communicate. The main aspects have been discussed below: ° Commonality and Diversity: People belong to vari- ous groups simultaneously, such as those based on educational, professional, economic, and religious affiliations, each with unique characteristics. A group of people from different cultures may have different com- munication styles. ° Group Characteristics: Groups vary in terms of dependence, acceptance, attraction, volition, innate membership, pressure, change, flexibility, and lead- ership. Group members from different cultures may also have different values and beliefs. For example, people from individualistic cultures may place a high value on self-expression, while peo- ple from collectivistic cultures may place a high value on group harmony. This can lead to conflict if group members do not understand and respect each other's values and beliefs. Group Leader = GL Participants = P Figure 4.8 Group Communication LeapersHip Ro.es in Group CommuNIcATION Leadership can be considered as the part of group commu- nication. Leadership is the process of influencing others to achieve a common goal. It is a complex and multifaceted activity that can be carried out in a variety of ways. There are two main types of leadership roles: ° Task-oriented Roles: These roles focus on complet- ing the task at hand. They involve initiating discus- sion, giving and receiving information, elaborating and clarifying, orienting and summarizing, and testing for consensus. ° Maintenance Roles: These roles focus on maintaining === Page 20 === the group and its members. They involve compromis- ing, supporting and encouraging, gatekeeping, stand- ard-setting and testing. Leadership Types: Leadership can be democratic, authoritarian, or laissez-faire. (a) Democratic Leadership: This involves the leader consulting with group members and seeking their input before making decisions. It is a collaborative and inclusive approach that can lead to better deci- sion-making and increased group commitment.

Summary:
Cultural concepts play a significant role in group communication, as different communication styles and values can lead to conflicts if not understood and respected, with leadership being a key aspect in influencing others to achieve common goals through task-oriented and maintenance roles, with democratic leadership involving consultation and collaboration with group members.

er consulting with group members and seeking their input before making decisions. It is a collaborative and inclusive approach that can lead to better deci- sion-making and increased group commitment. (b) Authoritarian Leadership: This involves the leader ~ making decisions without consulting with group members. It is a top-down approach that can be effec- tive in situations where quick decisions need to be made or where there is a need for a clear direction. However, it can also lead to resentment and frustra- tion among group members if it is not used judiciously. (c) Laissez-faire Leadership: The leader provides little or no guidance to group members. It is a hands-off approach that can be effective with creative and com- mitted people who are able to self-manage. However, it can also lead to chaos and disorganization if it is not used carefully. e Group Dynamics: Interaction within a group is influenced by factors like age, gender, educa- tion, and various societal, linguistic, and cultural differences. e Group Size and Efficiency: An optimal group size typically ranges from 5 to 7 members for effective interaction and information sharing. e Committees and Conferences: Groups can func- tion through committees (small, specific-purpose groups) or conferences (larger, more formal gatherings). e Effective Communication: Group communication is considered effective as it facilitates direct interac- tion among members, contributing to attitude and belief changes. e Primary and Secondary Groups: Group classifica- tion is divided into primary groups, characterized by intimate, personal relations and face-to-face interaction, and secondary groups, featuring for- mal, impersonal, and status-based relationships. Some Specific Communication Barriers in Groups: Though the main types of barriers have been discussed separately. Group members from different cultures may also have different communication barriers. For example, people from different cultures may have different lan- guages, accents, and non-verbal communication styles. This can make it difficult for group members to under- stand each other and communicate effectively.

Summary:
Group dynamics and leadership styles, such as consultative, authoritarian, and laissez-faire, play a significant role in group decision-making and efficiency, while effective communication and understanding of cultural differences are essential for successful group interactions.

Title: Understanding and Overcoming Cultural Communication Barriers

Text:
om different cultures may have different lan- guages, accents, and non-verbal communication styles. This can make it difficult for group members to under- stand each other and communicate effectively. In general, the main barriers to group communication are as follows: e Ethnocentrism: The belief that one’s own culture is superior to all others. Someone from USA claiming that American culture is the best culture in the world. We in India claims ourselves as Jagat Guru. » Stereotyping: Generalizations about groups of people that are often oversimplified and inaccurate. For exam. ple, all people from China are good at math. ° Prejudice: There may be negative attitudes or feelings towards a group of people based on stereotypes. For example, a teacher may have the feeling that a student from rural background (or even) gender are naughty. e Discrimination: Unequal treatment of a group of peo. ple based on stereotypes or prejudice. For example, an immigrant may be denied as job as s/he is from other country or race. ‘White man’s burden’ is a classic exam- ple of discrimination when Europeans colonized other parts of the world. The Strategies to Deal with such Communication Barriers e Assimilation: This means adopting the cultural values, beliefs, and behaviours of the ‘dominant culture’. How- ever, it can also lead to the loss of one’s own cultural identity. e Accommodation: This means adapting one’s commu- nication style and behaviour to the ‘other culture’. This can be difficult and time-consuming to adapt a new culture. ° Separation: This means maintaining one’s own cul- tural identity and avoiding contact with the dominant culture. This preserves own cultural heritage. However, it can also lead to isolation and marginalization. For exa pany pc to all er as com] bring d Important Aspects of Group Communication: These technical aspects are related with group communication, e Group Cohesion: The degree to which members of a group are united and feel a sense of belonging to the group. ¢ Group Norms: The shared beliefs and expectations of group members about how they should behave in the group.

Summary:
Cultural differences can create barriers to effective group communication, including ethnocentrism, stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination, which can be addressed through assimilation, accommodation, or separation strategies, while important aspects of group communication include group cohesion and group norms.

degree to which members of a group are united and feel a sense of belonging to the group. ¢ Group Norms: The shared beliefs and expectations of group members about how they should behave in the group. _ e Group Roles: The different roles that group members play within the group, such as leader, facilitator, and recorder. e Group Dynamics: The processes and interactions that occur within a group. ¢ Groupthink: A psychological phenomenon that occurs when a group makes a decision that is irrational or flawed because the group members are afraid to dissent or challenge the group’s consensus. ° Social loafing: The tendency for individuals to put in less effort when working in a group than when working alone. Grapevine Communication: This is actually informal communication. This is a type of informal communica- tion that occurs within groups. It is based on word-of- mouth and personal relationships, thus sometimes it becomes notorious for its speed and accuracy, this com- munication can be used to spread information quickly, but it has the risk of spreading rumours and gossip. This term originated during World War II. === Page 21 === The four types of grapevine communication are as ‘ollows: , Single strand chain: This is the simplest type of grape- _yine communication - where one person telling the jnformation to another person, who then tells it to another person, and so on. , Gossip chain: In addition to single strand chain, this involves the information being told to multiple people _at once. probability chain: This is less structured, and it involves the information being spread to whoever is willing to listen. Cluster chain: This is the most complex, that involves the information being spread to a select group of people. or example, if a manager wants to announce a new com- pany policy, they can use the grapevine to spread the word to all employees quickly, but any negative grapevine such company going bankrupt can make people anxious and ring down group morale and productivity. ErHNOCENTRISM VERSUS CuLTURAL RELATIVISM Ethnocentrism is the belief that one’s own culture is supe- rior and serves as the primary standard for evaluating other cultures.

Summary:
Group cohesion is the degree to which members of a group feel united and belong, with shared beliefs and expectations, different roles, processes and interactions, and potential pitfalls such as groupthink and social loafing, while grapevine communication can spread information quickly but also risks spreading rumors and gossip.

ErHNOCENTRISM VERSUS CuLTURAL RELATIVISM Ethnocentrism is the belief that one’s own culture is supe- rior and serves as the primary standard for evaluating other cultures. It often leads to the judgment of other cul. tures based on one’s own cultural norms. _ Cultural relativism, on the other hand, acknowledges the equal validity of all cultures and suggests that it’s inappropriate to impose one’s own cultural values on oth- ers. This perspective encompasses a wide range of human teractions, beliefs, values, and practices. Political leanings can influence these viewpoints, with onservatives often leaning toward ethnocentrism, and iberals tending to embrace cultural relativism. However, many people fall between these two extremes, recogniz- ng the need to transition from ethnocentrism to a more ‘thno-relativistic perspective for a more inclusive and cul- turally sensitive approach. nalytical Thinking vs. Holistic Thinking nalytical Thinking 1. This focuses on specific details and objects in the foreground. 2. Emphasizes cause-and-effect relationships. - Attributes success, like getting good marks, to indi- vidual effort and hard work. olistic Thinking - This considers the interdependent relationships between various elements. 2. Takes into account broader factors, such as the envi- ronment and parental support. - Associates success, like achieving good marks, with a combination of individual effort, a supportive envi- ronment, and external factors. 4. Holistic thinkers often embrace ambiguity and accept that things can change over time. High-context Versus Low-context Culture ’ High-context Culture 1. This is common in cultures like Eastern societies. 2. Relies on pre-existing knowledge of individuals. 3. Verbal messages can be seen as unnecessary or even threatening. : 4.

This model identifies five crucial stages in the communication process: FORMULATION OF IVIESSAGE Formulating a message is a critical step in the commu- nication process, influencing both the message and its reception. For example,the teacher prepares and organ- | izes the information to be conveyed in a clear and struc- tured manner. Several key points highlight the importance of this stage: Figure 4 1. Medium shapes the message: The choice of | communication medium, such as verbal, writ- ten, nonverbal, or visual, can significantly impact the message’s. sender, audience, and effects. It is important to consider the medium when formulat- | ing a message to ensure that it is communicated | effectively. === Page 23 === Message originates from an idea: Every com- munication begins with an idea or message that the sender wants to transmit to the audience. The sender may want to inform, persuade, or entertain the audience. Nature of the message: Messages can be verbal or nonverbal. Verbal messages are communicated through spoken or written words. Nonverbal mes- sages are communicated through body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice. Attributes of an effective communicator: Effective - communicators have certain attributes, such as the ability to think quickly, organize thoughts, and express themselves clearly. They are also able to adapt their communication style to the audience and situation. Teacher’s role in message formulation: Educators play a vital role in formulating messages for students. They need to conceptualize ideas, arrange them coherently, and consider the curriculum content to ensure that their communication is meaningful and organized.

Summary:
The Cole and Chan Model of Classroom Communication emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the equal validity of all cultures and not imposing one's own cultural values on others, while also highlighting the crucial stages in the communication process such as formulating a clear and structured message through effective medium choice, idea origination, message nature, attributes of an effective communicator, and the teacher's role in message formulation.

For example, the cts. It is teacher translates their knowledge into a format suitable for teaching, ensuring clarity and understanding. Several key points emphasize the importance of mes- Sage encoding: ormulat- unicated 1. Message Formulation: Before encoding, there is an internal process of shaping, sorting, and clarifying ideas. The goal of this formulation is to create a clear and meaningful message, ensuring that the intended message is well-structured. Conversion of Ideas: Encoding is the process of con- verting these formulated ideas into a format suitable for transmission to receivers. It involves translating thoughts, information, or intentions into a communi- cable form. Choice of Medium: The communicator not only cre- ates the message but also selects the medium for its delivery. This decision includes choosing whether to communicate through speech, writing, signaling, or gestures. 4. Consideration of Receiver: Effective encoding requires the communicator to consider the abilities and preferences of the receiver. The choice of media should be based on what the recipient can compre- hend best. For instance, using written communication may not be suitable for an illiterate audience, making oral communication a more effective choice. Role of Teachers: In educational settings, teachers encode their ideas differently depending on the curriculum requirements.

Summary:
Teachers play a crucial role in formulating and encoding messages for students by conceptualizing ideas, arranging them coherently, considering curriculum content, and selecting appropriate mediums based on the audience, purpose, tone, and style.

an illiterate audience, making oral communication a more effective choice. Role of Teachers: In educational settings, teachers encode their ideas differently depending on the curriculum requirements. They are responsible for using appropriate symbolic forms for each sub- ject and teaching students how to use these forms effectively. Message Transmission Message transmission is a crucial step in communication; and it’s all about how the message is sent. For example, The teacher delivers the message using various methods, aiming for effective communication. Here’s what you need to know: 1. Choosing the Right Way: At this stage, the sender decides on the best method to deliver their message. This means selecting the right channel or way of pre- senting the message. 2. What’s a Channel: A ‘channel’ is like the delivery truck for your message. It’s how your message gets from you to the other person. There are many options, like speaking, writing, using body language, or even mass media like TV. Teachers, for example, might use films or hands-on demonstrations to teach the same thing. They can use different channels to make sure everyone understands. 1. Understanding these points helps make sure your message gets across effectively by choosing the right delivery method. Messace DecopinG AND INTERPRETATION Message decoding and interpretation involve the receiver making sense of the message sent by the communicator, For example, students receive and decode the message, actively engaging with the content to understand the intended meaning. === Page 24 === Here are the key points: 1. Active Interpretation: Decoding isn’t a passive pro- cess. The receiver actively interprets the message based on their background knowledge and the com- munication context. Language itself doesn’t have meaning; it’s the decoder who gives it meaning. 2. Background Knowledge: Having relevant back- ground information and familiarity with the language used makes decoding and understanding the message easier. 3. Listening, Reading, and Thinking: The receiver’s ability to listen, read, and think is crucial for effective decoding.

Summary:
Teachers in educational settings must encode their ideas differently depending on the curriculum requirements, choose the right delivery method for effective communication, and ensure that students actively engage with and interpret the message to understand the intended meaning.

ty with the language used makes decoding and understanding the message easier. 3. Listening, Reading, and Thinking: The receiver’s ability to listen, read, and think is crucial for effective decoding. Without these skills, they won’t be able to receive and interpret messages as intended. 4. Receiver’s Significance: In the communication pro- cess, the receiver plays a vital role. Effective commu- nication relies on the receiver’s ability to accurately decode and interpret the message. Feedback and Evaluation Feedback and evaluation are essential aspects of the com- munication process. For example, students provide feed- back, enabling the teacher to assess the effectiveness of communication and make necessary adjustments. The key points are as follows: 1. Feedback Definition: Feedback is the response or acknowledgment provided by the receiver to the com- municator’s message. It’s a critical part of the commu- nication process and is often considered a motor func- tion. : 2. Receiver’s Reaction: It involves the receiver react- ing to the messages they receive and conveying their response back to the sender. 3. Adapting Messages: Effective communicators encourage feedback and use it to adjust the content and presentation of their messages. Feedback helps in refining communication. 4. Teacher-Student Dynamics: Teachers should be attuned to the various ways students convey reactions to messages. Skilled teachers can control feedback to enhance the ongoing communication process without unnecessary interference. 5. Non-Verbal Feedback: Feedback can be conveyed through non-verbal cues like facial expressions, gestures, or seeking clarification. This continuous interaction between the communicator and receiver shapes and refines the message. 6. Evaluation: Feedback offers an opportunity to evalu- ate the effectiveness of a communication. It helps in assessing what works and what doesn’t, facilitating the improvement of the message. 7. Interactive Model in Classroom: In the classroom setting, feedback plays a significant role in the inter- action between teachers and students. This dynamic model involves constant role changes and bidirec- tional communication.

Summary:
Feedback is a crucial aspect of the communication process, as it allows the receiver to provide a response to the message, adapt messages for better understanding, and evaluate the effectiveness of communication in order to make necessary adjustments.

om: In the classroom setting, feedback plays a significant role in the inter- action between teachers and students. This dynamic model involves constant role changes and bidirec- tional communication. Effective feedback and evaluation are crucial for refining and enhancing the quality of communication. Noise Noise can significantly disrupt effective communication Here are important points about noise in communication: 1. Definition: Noise is any interruption or interfereng that can occur at any stage of the communication pro cess, rendering it ineffective. 2. Environmental Noise: External factors in the enyj ronment, like traffic noise, loudspeakers, or back. ground chatter, can disrupt message reception. Poorly lit rooms can also contribute to environmental noise, 3. Other Forms of Noise: Noise isn’t limited to exter. nal factors. Poor handwriting, strong accents, or soft speech can also act as barriers to effective communication. Categories of Noise ® Physiological Noise: Distractions caused by physic factors like hunger, fatigue, illness, or medication. ° Physical Noise: Direct interference from the physical environment, such as traffic noise, inadequate lighting, and other external factors. Psychological Noise: Internal factors like preoccu- pation with personal issues, prejudice, or defensive- ness that affect how individuals interpret and convey. messages. Semantic Noise: Occurs when words themselves are not mutually understood, such as when technical jargon or unclear language is used. To ensure smooth and effective communication, it is cru- cial to identify and reduce or eliminate noise as much as possible. Noise can hinder the clarity and understanding of messages, making it essential to address and minimize _ its impact. How To Maxe Communication System Better © in Epucation Sector 1. Negative Entropy: Maintaining order and organiza- tion within the educational system to prevent chaos or decline. 2. Feedback: Using responses from students, teachers, and other stakeholders to improve and adapt educa- tional processes and content. 3.

iers IN COMMUNICATION 1. Semantic Barriers: These occur when people from different cultures or languages disagree on the mean- ings of words, making it difficult to establish a com- mon understanding. It’s particularly common when individuals speak different languages. High-context and Low-context Cultures: High- context cultures rely heavily on non-verbal cues and shared situational understanding to communicate, while low-context cultures use explicit verbal com- munication. Understanding these cultural differences is crucial for effective communication. Cross-cultural Communication: This field of study examines how people from diverse cultural back- grounds communicate both similarly and differently. It explores the strategies and challenges of communi- cation across cultures. MECHANICAL BARRIERS Mechanical barriers in communication, found in both interpersonal and mass communication, can hinder the message’s smooth transmission: === Page 28 === e Nature of Mechanical Barriers: These barriers can lead to difficulties in receiving a message, resulting in either partial message loss or distortion. They may stem from issues with communication facilities. e Channel Noise: This term describes disturbances in the physical transmission of messages, such as radio disruptions, TV screen blurriness, ink smudging in print media, inaudibility in telephone calls, or device malfunctions. e Cultural and Social Factors: Mechanical barriers are not solely technical; they can also be influenced by cul- tural, social, and language factors, customs, beliefs, motives, or even illiteracy. In workplace communication, several barriers can affect effective communication: 1. Language Barrier: The same message may be inter- preted differently by different individuals due to vari- ations in language comprehension, vocabulary, and dialects. 2. Perceptual Biases: Perceptual biases, including ste- reotyping, projection, and self-fulfilling prophecies, can distort how people perceive and understand messages. Stereotyping involves assuming that indi- viduals from a particular group possess specific traits, even when this may not be the case. 3.

Summary:
Semantic barriers, high-context and low-context cultures, and cross-cultural communication all play a role in hindering effective communication, while mechanical barriers such as channel noise and cultural factors can also impact the transmission of messages.

cies, can distort how people perceive and understand messages. Stereotyping involves assuming that indi- viduals from a particular group possess specific traits, even when this may not be the case. 3. Impersonal Relationships: Prior experiences with a communicator can influence how individuals perceive messages. Communication from a higher authority may be perceived differently than commu- nication from a colleague or subordinate. 4, Cultural Differences: Effective communication requires an understanding of the fundamental motives, values, assumptions, and aspirations operat-. ing within different cultures. These cultural variations can impact how messages are conveyed and received, necessitating cultural sensitivity in communication practices. ORGANIZATIONAL BARRIERS Organizational barriers in communication arise as organ- izations develop and can be attributed to various condi- tions: 1. Size of the Organization: Larger organizations tend to face more communication challenges due to their scale and complexity. 2, Physical Distance Between Employees: Geographically dispersed teams or remote work arrangements can hinder effective communication. 3. Specialization of Jobs and Activities: Highly spe- cialized roles may lead to jargon and difficulties in conveying information across functions. 4, Organizational Culture: The culture within an organization greatly impacts the freedom and trust among employees and, consequently, the flow of communication. 5. Organizational Rules and Regulations: Strict poli. cies and procedures may create bureaucratic obstg_ cles that impede open communication. 6. Power Structure: The hierarchy and power dynamicg - in an organization can affect how freely information flows between different levels of employees. 7. Complexity in Organizational Structure: A complex organizational structure with numerous departments and reporting lines can introduce layers that hinder communication. 8. Inadequate Facilities and Opportunities: A lack of appropriate communication tools or spaces for inter. action can act as barriers.

Summary:
Various factors such as stereotypes, impersonal relationships, cultural differences, organizational size, physical distance, job specialization, organizational culture, rules and regulations, power structure, complexity, and inadequate facilities can create barriers to effective communication within organizations.

Four Types of Powers in Communication 1. Expressing Yourself: Communication begins from. the moment we enter the world. It involves conveying." your thoughts, ideas, and emotions effectively. 2, Listening and Responding: Effective communica- tion is a two-way process. Actively listening to others and providing thoughtful responses is a crucial power _ in communication. 3. Regulating Attention and Intention: Emotional intelligence plays a significant role in communic tion. Understanding and controlling your emotional responses and intentions canimprove communication. 4. Understanding and Responding to People in Their | ‘Style’: Recognizing that people have different com- munication styles and adapting your approach to suit their preferences enhances the effectiveness of communication. Physical Barriers in Communication 1. Competing Stimulus: Other distractions, such as. background conversations or traffic noise, can com- pete with the message being conveyed, making it challenging to focus on the communication. 2. Environmental Stress: Uncomfortable environmen- tal conditions like high temperatures or poor ventila- tion can disrupt communication. 3. Subjective Stress: Personal factors like sleeplessness, illness, drug effects, and mood swings can affect one’s ability to engage in effective communication. 4, Receiver’s Unfamiliarity with Medium: When the recipient is not familiar with the communication medium being used, it can act as a barrier to under- « standing and effective interaction.

Summary:
Various barriers to communication, such as reporting lines, inadequate facilities, lack of cooperation, physical barriers, and different types of powers in communication, can hinder effective communication between individuals.

unication. 4, Receiver’s Unfamiliarity with Medium: When the recipient is not familiar with the communication medium being used, it can act as a barrier to under- « standing and effective interaction. === Page 29 === Ile obs MMUNICATION overcome barriers in communication, supervisors and dyna nagers should take the following steps: ormat : Regulate the Flow of Information: Ensure that Acom jnformation flows smoothly and is not impeded by oartme “ynnecessary obstacles. Feedback: Encourage feedback to confirm that the message was received and understood as intended. Use Simple Language: Communicate in a clear and straightforward manner, using language that is easily understood. : Consider the Recipient’s Level of Knowledge: Tailor your communication to the recipient’s level of knowledge, educational qualifications, and fluency in their language. Whenever possible, use the recipient’s mother tongue. _ Listen Carefully: Actively listen to what others are saying. Be patient, ask questions for clarification, eliminate distractions, and focus entirely on the speaker. Control Emotions: Emotions such as anger or frus- tration can distort the message. It’s best to postpone communication until emotions are under control. Observe Non-verbal Cues or Body Language: Pay attention to non-verbal cues and body language dur- ing oral communication to ensure that the message aligns with the receiver’s understanding. OMMUNICATIONS THROUGH EmoTicons moticons are visual representations of emotions in writ- n communication. They are used to convey feelings and pressions and are often seen in computer-related con- versations. Key points about emoticons: Origin: The term ‘emoticon’ is derived from a com- bination of ‘emotion’ and ‘icon.’ The first emoticons, like the smiley face (:-)) and frowny face :-(, were cre- ated by Scott E. Fahlman in 1982 to indicate humour in computer systems. Functions: Emoticons serve several functions, such as conveying a positive attitude, adding humour or indi- cating irony, and softening or strengthening speech acts in written interaction.

Summary:
Unfamiliarity with communication mediums can hinder understanding and effective interaction, but barriers can be overcome by regulating information flow, encouraging feedback, using simple language, tailoring communication to the recipient's knowledge level, actively listening, controlling emotions, and paying attention to non-verbal cues, with emoticons serving as visual representations of emotions in written communication.

er systems. Functions: Emoticons serve several functions, such as conveying a positive attitude, adding humour or indi- cating irony, and softening or strengthening speech acts in written interaction. Difference from Emoji: Emoticons are created using ASCII symbols, while emojis are pictographs repre- senting faces, objects, and symbols. Emojis are a more recent invention. Usage: Emoticons are commonly used in chat soft- ware, and they help supplement and organize inter- personal written communication. They are often used to convey emotions and tone that might be missing in text. Studies: Research on emoticons has shown that they are used more frequently by women, and their use can vary based on the context of the communication. oroach 1 ‘veness to under- Emoticons are considered semiotic resources in written communication, allowing individuals to modify speech, provide context to discourse, and enhance social relation- ships through text-based conversations. SPEECH ACT AND POLITENESS THEORY Speech act theory and politeness theory are two impor- tant concepts in linguistics, and they help us understand different aspects of language and communication. Key points about these theories: 1. Speech Act Theory: e Speech act theory deals with the idea that speaking is not just conveying information but also perform- ing actions. It distinguishes between constatives (descriptive statements that can be true or false) and performatives (utterances that realize a social action). e Utterances have three acts: locutionary (making a meaningful utterance), illocutionary (making requests, offers, jokes, promises), and perlocution- ary (the effect on the audience). e There are five main categories of speech acts: Direc- tives (requests), Expressives (thanking), Repre- sentatives (assertions), Commissives (promises), and Declarations (appointments). 2. Politeness Theory: ° Politeness theory, developed by Penelope Brown and Stephen C. Levinson, is concerned with behav- ing in a socially acceptable manner with proper manners and etiquette. e Hedging is a key aspect of politeness theory. Hedges are expressions that modify the speech act rather than the logical form of the utterance.

Summary:
Emoticons serve various functions in written communication, such as conveying emotions and tone, and are commonly used in chat software to enhance interpersonal interactions, while speech act theory and politeness theory help understand the performative nature of language and the importance of behaving in a socially acceptable manner with proper manners and etiquette.

ly acceptable manner with proper manners and etiquette. e Hedging is a key aspect of politeness theory. Hedges are expressions that modify the speech act rather than the logical form of the utterance. They can be strengtheners (emphasizing the con- tent) or softeners (softening the content) and indicate the speaker’s commitment to what they are saying. These theories help us understand not only the linguistic aspects of communication but also the social and cultural dimensions, including how language is used to perform various acts and maintain politeness in interactions. barrier in communication?

always goal- oriented. It is creative and reflective in nature. Reasoning ability develops gradually. It means that experiences are also helpful in developing reasoning power along with intelligence. There may be more than one logic to draw an inference—reasoning is multi-dimensional. Numerous philosophical mathematicians and psychol- ogists have given the following six steps for reasoning: TYPES OF REASONING Aristotle gave an extended, systematic treatment of the methods of human reasoning. The three methods were deductive, inductive and abductive reasonings (Fig. 5.1). 1. Deductive reasoning: Deductive reasoning is also known as analytical reasoning as it deals with objects by looking at its component parts. Formal logic has been described as the science of deduction. The con- cept of syllogism has been explained in Chapter 6. 2. Inductive reasoning: Inductive reasoning is also known as ‘synthetic reasoning’ and deals with a class of objects by looking at the common properties of each object in the class. The study of inductive rea- soning is generally carried out within a field known as ‘informal logic’ or ‘critical thinking’. 3. Abductive reasoning: Abductive reasoning is con- sidered as the third form of reasoning. It is somewhat similar to inductive reasoning. It takes its clues from the term ‘guessing’, since conclusions drawn here are based on probabilities. Here, it is presumed that the most plausible conclusion is also the correct one. Logical reasoning Inductive reasoning Abductive reasoning Non-verbal sequences Number sequences Figure 5.1 Reasoning and its Types Deductive reasoning Syllogisms Example: Major premise: The container is filled with yellow peb- bles. Minor premise: Bobby has a yellow pebble in his hand. Conclusion: The yellow pebble in Bobby’s hand was taken out of the container. By abductive reasoning, the possibility that Bobby took the yellow pebble from the container. is reason- able, though it is purely based on speculation. Anyone could have given the yellow pebble to Bobby, or prob- ably Bobby could have bought a yellow pebble at a retail store.

Summary:
Reasoning is goal-oriented, creative, and reflective, with experiences helping to develop reasoning power, and there are three main types of reasoning: deductive, inductive, and abductive.

Title: Types of Deductive Reasoning: Hypothetical Syllogism and Modus Ponens

Text:
m the container. is reason- able, though it is purely based on speculation. Anyone could have given the yellow pebble to Bobby, or prob- ably Bobby could have bought a yellow pebble at a retail store. Therefore, abducing that Bobby took the yellow pebble, from the observation of ‘the yellow pebble—filled container’, may lead to a false conclusion. Unlike deduc- tive and inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning is not commonly used for psychometric testing. Here, we can discuss other forms of reasoning as well. HypPoTHETICAL Sy.Locism (Mopus Ponens) A syllogism is simply a three-line argument that consists of exactly two premises and a conclusion. A hypothetical syllogism is a syllogism that includes at least one hypo- thetical or conditional (if-then) premise. This is why such type of deductive reasoning is also known as condi- tional reasoning. This pattern of reasoning is also known as modus ponens. The four varieties of modus ponens are as follows. Chain Argument Chain arguments consist of three conditional statements that are linked together. Here is an example of a chain argument. If I do not appear in the exam, then I will fail in graduation. If I fail in graduation, then I will lose my time and money. Therefore, if I do not appear in exam, I will lose my time and money. Modus Toliens Here is These are sometimes called ‘denying the consequences’ Here, | because they consist of one conditional premise, a second or entire premise that denies (asserts to be false) the consequences === Page 9 === he conditional and a conclusion that denies to be the ecedent of the conditional. Here is an example of dus tollens argument. ¢ we are in Manchester, then we are in Gujarat. We are not in Gujarat. Therefore, we are not in Manchester. nying the Antecedent Argument uch arguments, the first premise denies (i.e. asserts to alse) the antecedent of the conditional and a conclu- denies the consequent of the conditional. Here is an example. ; f we are in Chandigarh, then we are in the North. We are not in Chandigarh. Therefore, we are not in the North. We can notice that the premises in the above—men- oned examples are true and the conclusion is false.

Summary:
Abductive reasoning, unlike deductive and inductive reasoning, is not commonly used for psychometric testing and other forms of reasoning such as hypothetical syllogism (modus ponens) and denying the antecedent argument are discussed.

Nand is a cardiologist. Therefore, Nand is a doctor. A straightforward relationship between the cardiolo- st and the doctor (two elements) is observed here. The nclusion of valid deductive reasoning contains no more formation than the premise. hs are ments chain Argument by Elimination An argument by elimination seeks to logically rule out vari- Ous possibilities until only a single possibility remains. It is like attempting questions in an examination. ‘ail in e and se my Argument Based on Mathematics The main aim of mathematics is to develop the reasoning ower of humanity. Here is an example. Here, the conclusion is claimed to depend largely ¢ entirely on some mathematical calculation or ances’ acond ences measurement (perhaps in conjunction with one or more non-mathematical premises). Twelve is greater than eight. Eight is greater than four. Therefore, twelve is greater than four. Let us discuss the inductive reasoning in more detail. The statement or proposition is based on general observations and experiences; such reasoning is called inductive reasoning. There is a strong contrast with deductive reasoning. Even in the strongest cases of inductive reasoning, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.

Summary:
The argument presented involves faulty reasoning patterns such as affirming the consequent, argument from definition, argument by elimination, and argument based on mathematics, highlighting the limitations of inductive reasoning.

Title: Patterns of Inductive Reasoning

Text:
inductive reasoning. There is a strong contrast with deductive reasoning. Even in the strongest cases of inductive reasoning, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Rather, the con- clusion of an inductive argument follows some degree of probability. There may be more information in the conclusion of an inductive reasoning than that already contained in the premises. Thus, this method of reason- ing is applicative. In inductive reasoning, a statement in one particu- lar case will be true in all other cases in the same serial order. It may be applied generally to all such cases. Here, one can formulate a generalized statement or principle and conclusions on the basis of certain facts and specific examples. Once we have discussed inductive reasoning, we can now discuss six common patterns of inductive reasoning: 1. Inductive generalization: It is an argument in which a generalization is claimed to be probably true based on the information about some members of a class. All inductive generalizations claim that their conclusions are probable rather than certain. 2. Predictive argument: It is a statement about what may or will happen in the future; here a prediction is defended with reasons. It is among the most common patterns of inductive reasoning. Here is an example: It has rained in Mumbai every June since weather records have been maintained. Therefore, it will probably rain in Mumbai next June. Nothing in the future is absolutely certain; argu- ments containing predictions are usually inductive. 3. Argument from authority: The conclusion is sup- ported by presumed authority or witness who has said that the conclusion is true. We can never be abso- lutely certain that a presumed authority or witness is accurate or reliable. 4. Causal argument: One of the most basic, most com- mon and most important kinds of knowledge we seek is the knowledge of cause and effect. A causal argu- ment asserts or denies that something is the cause of something else. : 5. Statistical argument: A statistical argument rests on statistical evidence, that is, evidence that some percentage of some group has some particular characteristics.

Summary:
Inductive reasoning involves drawing conclusions based on probability rather than certainty, and can be applied to various patterns such as inductive generalization, predictive argument, argument from authority, causal argument, and statistical argument.

the cause of something else. : 5. Statistical argument: A statistical argument rests on statistical evidence, that is, evidence that some percentage of some group has some particular characteristics. === Page 10 === 6. Argument from analogy: An analogy is a compari- son of two or more things that are claimed to be alike in some relevant respect. Towards the end, we can say that inductive reasoning is informative because the conclusion of an inductive rea- soning contains more information than is already con- tained in the premises. Other Reasoning Types We are using verbal and non-verbal symbols to communi- cate with others. There are five types of reasoning, which are explained as follows: 1. Verbal reasoning: Normally, we communicate with others by language, and the language is a vehicle for reasoning. So reasoning without language or words and symbols is not possible. In verbal reasoning, we use linguistic symbols such as words. Some verbal reasoning ability tests are available. 2. Non-verbal reasoning: In competitive examinations, we observe that a part of the written paper consists of reasoning, containing ome figures, graphs and draw- ings which can measure the non-verbal reasoning ability of the contestant. 3. Reasoning as propositions: It is often difficult to determine whether a long and complex argument is valid or invalid just by reading. The logical process of analysis of the parts of whole arguments and symbol- izing them to determine the validity of arguments is known as propositional reasoning. Here is an example. Ifa=4,b=7,a+c=b, thenc=? 4+c=7. Therefore, c= 3. 4. Automated reasoning: It is basically an area of com- puter science. It understands different aspects of rea- soning to allow the creation of computer software to reason completely or almost completely automati- cally. Sometimes, it is usually considered a subfield of artificial intelligence, but it also has strong con- nections to theoretical computer science and even philosophy. 5. Brain’s centre of reasoning: The left hemisphere is dominant for most people; it controls written and spoken languages and mathematical calculations.

Summary:
Different types of reasoning include statistical argument, argument from analogy, verbal reasoning, non-verbal reasoning, reasoning as propositions, automated reasoning, and the brain's center of reasoning in the left hemisphere.

Brain’s centre of reasoning: The left hemisphere is dominant for most people; it controls written and spoken languages and mathematical calculations. The prefrontal cortex is the farthest forward area in the brain and is an associated area of the frontal lobe. The left hemisphere of the brain is said to be analyti- cal, logical, mathematical and concerned with cause and effect related to scientific thinking. A series may consist of a number series or a letter series. There are several such series, such as finding the missing numbers, replacing the wrong numbers, finding the miss- ing letters and finding the wrong group of numbers or let- ters, to name a few. Numeer Sentes Prime Number Series Example 1; 2, 3,5, 7, 11, 13,17,... (a) 15 (b) 17 (c) 18 (d) 19 Solution: The given series is a prime number series: The next prime number is 19. Therefore, (d) is the correct answer. Example 2: 2, 5, 11, 17, 23, 31,... (a) 33 (b) 37 (c) 41 Solution: The prime numbers in this range are 2, 3, 5,7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, .... Prime numbers have been written alternatively. Thus, after 31, the prime numbers are 37, 41, .... Ignoring 37, the answer is 41. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer. (d) 43 Difference Series Example 3: 2, 5, 8,11, 14, 17, ..., 23, 26 (a) 19 (b) 21 (c) 20 (d) 18 Solution: The difference between the numbers is 3 (17+3=20). Therefore, (c) is the correct answer. Example 4: 45, 38, ..., 24, 17, 10,3 (a) 31 (b) 34 (c) 38 (d) 29 Solution: The difference between the consecutive numbers is 7 (38 — 7=31). Therefore, (a) is the correct answer. Multiplication Series Example 5: 2, 6, 18, 54, ..., 486, 1458 (a) 152 (b) 182 (c) 162 (d) 108 Solution: The numbers are multiplied by 3 to get the next. number (54 x 3 = 162). Therefore, (c) is the correct answer. Example 6: 3, 12, 48, ..., 768, 3072 (a) 192 (b) 216 (c) 512 (d) 72 Solution: The numbers are multiplied by 4 to get the next. number (48 x 4= 192). Therefore, (a) is the correct answer.

LetTerR Series In this type of problem, a series of letters of the English alphabet will be given which follow a pattern or a sequence. The letter series mainly consists of skipping the letters. To solve these types of problems, assign numbers 1-26 to the letters of English alphabet as shown below. In some cases, it is useful to assign the numbers in a reverse order. Concept of ‘EJOTY’ letters EO J 10 15. Position 5 25 The candidates can determine the relative positions of various alphabets by just remembering the word ‘EJOTY’. Various types of letter series are given as follows: ° First alphabetical half: A to M > 1-13 ° Second alphabetical half: N to Z > 14-26 Tables 5.1 and 5.2 show both the forward and the backward place values of the English alphabet. A very important fact about the position of any letter is that the sum of forward position and reverse position for any let- ter is always constant and equal to 27. For example, the sum of both positions of H is (8 + 19 = 27), and for W is (23+ 4=27).

The codes are based on various principles or patterns such hat the message can be easily deciphered at the other end. hey have become an almost regular feature of NET Paper Exam to judge the candidates’ intelligence and mental bilities. They are required to encode and decode words nd sentences after observing the pattern and principles Involved. These questions can be broadly classified into Iphabetical coding, numerical coding and mixed coding. LPHABETICAL CopDING Remembering the positions of different letters is nec- €ssary to solve any question on alphabetical series. The English language contains 26 alphabets and their varied Positions are discussed in Tables 5.1-5.3. mother logic and the third letters follow some other In these types of questions, the letters of the alpha- bet are exclusively used. These letters do not stand for themselves but are allotted some artificial values based on some logical pattern or analogy. By applying those principles or observing the pattern involved, the candi- dates are required to decode a coded word or encode a word. This can be further classified into the following categories. Simple Analogical Letter Coding These are also called arbitrary codes. There are two defi-. nite principles or patterns involved. Codes are based on the analogy of one example from which different codes are formed. Example 32: If‘BELONGINGS is coded as ‘TABLESTESP’, then how will you code ‘LINEN’?. (a) BTEAE (b) BTAEA (c) BATEA (d) None of these Solution The coding is done as follows: L Se a a Codes” t A BL. Accordingly, the code for LINEN is BTEAE. Thus, the answer is (a). Letter Copine on Speciric Pattern First, the candidates are required to observe the specific pattern involved and then proceed with encoding or decoding as the case may be.

Summary:
Alphabetical coding involves decoding words based on specific patterns and principles, such as assigning artificial values to letters, in order to decipher messages in exams like the NET Paper Exam.

E. Thus, the answer is (a). Letter Copine on Speciric Pattern First, the candidates are required to observe the specific pattern involved and then proceed with encoding or decoding as the case may be. Example 33; If ‘POSTED’ is coded as ‘DETSOP’, then how will you code ‘SPEED’? (a) DEEPS (c) DESEP (b) DEESP (d) SPEDE Solution: By careful observation, we can say that the letters have been written in the reverse order. Hence, SPEED will be written DEEPS; therefore, (a) is the correct answer. Example 34: If‘GREET’ is coded as ‘FQDDS’, then ‘CDDO’ stands for (a) EDDP (b) DEEP (c) PEED (d) EPED Solution: Here, it is —1 for each letter of the word’ ‘GREET’. === Page 14 === CDDO itself is a code. To find out what it stands for, we have to add +1 to the alphabets to get back the original word. Code ; Cc DD. oO +1 +1 +1 +1 Word =D Bee EP (b) is the correct answer. Example 35: If ‘PAT’ is coded as ‘QRBCUV,, then how will you code ‘GRACE’? (a) HISTBCDEFG (c) HISBTCDEFG (b) HISTBCDEGF (d) HISTBCEDFG Solution: The pattern of coding is such that each letter has been allotted the value of two letters following the sequence, that is, A= BC, B= CD, C=DE, etc. Hence, the word GRACE will be coded as ‘HISTBCDEFG’. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer. Example 36: If ‘EGHJKMKM’ is the code for ‘FILL, then how will you decode ‘EGDFDFKM’? (a) LEEF (b) FEEL (c) DEAL (d) REEL Solution: Refer to alphabet series in Table 5.1. Starting from the L.H.S. pair; E is the antecedent of F and G is the precedent of F. We get EG as code for F, HJ as code for I and so on. Similarly, EGDFDFKM is the code for FEEL. F is coded as EG with its precedent and antecedent letters. Similarly, is coded as HJ and Las KM. Hence, EGDFDFKM stands for FEEL. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer. Copine with Numericar Dicits Here, the numerical values (not necessarily according to rank of letters in the alphabet series) can be assigned to letters. The values are allotted based on some specific pat- tern that has to be discerned by the candidate in order to solve the problem.

Summary:
The candidates are required to observe specific patterns in encoding or decoding letters, such as reversing the order or assigning numerical values, in order to determine the correct code for given words.

The values are allotted based on some specific pat- tern that has to be discerned by the candidate in order to solve the problem. Example 37: If ‘TRAIN’ is coded as 23456, then how will you code ‘RAIN’? (a) 3456 (b) 3546 (c) 2345 (d) 2456 Solution: ‘Word T RA IN Code 2 3 4 5 6 These values have been assigned arbitrarily. The question can be solved on the basis of the relationship established. For RAIN, the code is 3456, so (a) is the correct answer. Analogical Coding with Numerical Digits Here, the letters are assigned numerical values on the basis of the analogy of the example given in the question. There is no set of principles or patterns involved. The can. didates are required to study the given examples before getting started with the exercise. Example 38: If ‘SELDOM’ is coded as ‘1 2 43 6 5’, then how will you code ‘MODE’? (a) 3621 (c)5632 (d)6213 (b) 6231 Solution On the basis of the analogical relationship established between the letters and the numbers, we can code ‘MODE’ as 5632. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer. Coding with Specific Pattern This is a pattern of coding that exhibits the natural cor- relation of Arabic numbers with alphabetical letters. For instance, alphabets A to Z are assigned the numeric codes from 1 to 26, where each letter gets the assignment in the pattern as follows: A=1, B= 2, C=3, ete. The sequence is classified as follows: 1. Forward sequence: For example, A=1,B=2,...,. Y= 25,Z=26 , Example 39: If ‘PACE’ is code as 16-1~3-5, then how will you code ‘RACE’? (a) 18-1-3-5 (b) 16-1-3-5 (c) 16-3-5-1 (d) None of the above By referring to Table 5.1, we can say that (a) is the correct answer. 2. Backward sequence: For example, Z=1, Y=2,...,B =25,A=26 Example 40: If ‘GREAT’ is coded as 20-9-22-26-7, then how will you code ‘GATE’? (a) 20-26-7-22 (b) 20~-26-6-22 (c) 26-20—-7-22 (d) 26-20-—22-7 By referring to Table 5.2, (a) is the correct answer. 3. Random sequence: The pattern can be established in alternative ways, but in every case, a set pattern has to be discovered by careful examination of the example given in the question.

Summary:
Coding with numerical values can be done based on specific patterns or analogies between letters and numbers, with candidates needing to discern the relationship in order to solve the problem.

Some common relationships are ithe cub given below, which will help you detect most analogies better. _ Different types of analogy are given below. ROUP Direct/Simpce ANALOGY of the fol In these types of questions, the first two words have a definite relationship. According to the relationship, we have to choose one word out of the given four alternatives ap that i that have the same relationship with the third word as between the first two. Example 54; Apparel is related to cloth in the same way as footwear is related to (a) Laces (c) Leather (b) Cobbler (d) Shoes Explanation. ’ The first is made by the other. Thus, the correct answer is (c). Example 55: As ‘delicious’ is related to taste, ‘melodious’ is related to (a) Voice (b) Speak (c) Music (d) Highness Explanation Delicious represents good taste. Similarly, melodious describes pleasant voice. Thus, the correct answer is (a). CompPLetion of ANALOGOUS Pair Example 56: Giant : Dwarf :: Genius : ? (a) Wicked (b) Gentle (c) Idiot (d) Cunning Explanation As dwarf is the antonym of giant, idiot is the antonym of genius. Thus, the correct answer is (c). Example 57: Fruit : Banana :: Mammal : ? (a) Cow (b) Snake (c) Fish (d) Sparrow Explanation As banana is a type of fruit, cow is a type of mammal. Thus, the correct answer is (a). SELECTING THE Richt ANALoGous Pair In these types of questions, a pair of word is given that is followed by four pairs of words as alternatives. The can- didate is required to choose the pair in which the words bear the same relationship to each other as in the case of the words of the given pair. Example 58; Lamp : Darkness (a) Fatigue : Exercise (b) Water : Thirst (c) Medicine : Ilness (d) Study : Classroom Explanation Just as a lamp eliminates darkness, water quenches thirst. Thus, the correct answer is (b). Example 59; Weight : Kilograms (a) Axe : Grind (b) Ammeter : Current (c) Power : Ampere (d) Energy : Joule === Page 18 === Explanation As weight can be measured in kilogram, joule is the unit of measuring energy. Thus, the correct answer is (d).

Summary:
Analogies involve identifying relationships between two objects and applying the same relationship to find the answer to the question.

Suppose M is male and N is female. Some authors use the signs of + and ~ for indicating male and female. Cousin is acommon gender; it means that this relationship can be used for both male and female. N is female ‘Mand Nare married to each other P and Q are siblings A has two children B and C Approach To Draw THE FamiLy RELATIONS DiacRAM To draw a family tree: 1. First of all, identify the males and the females, and then according to generation, put each member at the appropriate position in the tree. 2. Draw the diagram with relationships among family members using notations. 3. Once the diagram is filled, the candidate can answer the given questions. #xample 67: X and Y are brothers. C and D are sisters. X’s son is D’s brother. How is Y related to C? (a) Uncle (b) Grandfather (c) Father (d) None of these Explanation +X <————» +Y +Son -D -C As per the statement and the family tree, X’s son, D and C are siblings. Y is the uncle of C. Thus, (a) is the correct answer. Example 68: ‘A is the father of ‘C’, and ‘D’ is the son of ‘B’. ‘ is the brother of ‘A’. If ‘C’ is the sister of ‘D’, then how is ‘B’ related to ‘E’? [NET June 2007] (a) Daughter (b) Husband (c) Sister-in-law (d) Brother-in-law === Page 20 === Explanation +E <—> A=B —C <—— iD Thus, B is the sister-in-law of E. (c) is the correct answer. Example 69: £ is the son of A; D is the son of B; E is married to C; Cis the daughter of B. Howis D related to E? [NET June 2010] (a) Brother (c) Father-in-law (b) Uncle (d) Brother-in-law Explanation Family tree: +E = -C +D Hence, D is the brother-in-law of E. Therefore, (d) is the correct answer. Example 70: If B is the only child of C’s grandfather’s only daughter, then how is C’s father related to B? (a) Maternal uncle (b) Father (c) Paternal uncle (d) Cannot be determined Explanation C’s grandfather Only daughter «——-— - --- ———» Brother (C’s father) As B is the only child, C cannot be the sister of B. On the other hand, B’s mother is the only daughter of her par- ents, so she can have a brother. Hence, C’s father is the maternal uncle of B. Thus, (a) is the correct answer.

Summary:
The process of drawing a family tree involves identifying males and females, placing them in the appropriate positions on the tree, and using notations to show relationships, allowing for the answering of questions about familial connections.

Thus, (a) is the correct answer. There are four main directions: east, west, north ang south, shown as follows: There are four cardinal directions, such as north-east (NE), north-west (NW), south-east (SE) and south-west (SW), shown as follows: Nw N NE SW Ss SE Few Important Points 1. At the time of sunrise, if a person stands facing the east, then his/her shadow will be towards the west. 2. Atthe time of sunset, the shadow of an object is always in the east. 3. If a person stands facing the north, at the time of sun- rise, his/her shadow will be towards his/her left; and at the time of sunset, it will be towards his/her right. 4. At 12 p.m., the rays of the sun are vertically down- ward. Hence, there will be no shadow. Example 71: Prakash walked 30 m westward, took a left turn and walked 20 m. He again took a left turn and — walked 30 m. Then, he took a right turn and stopped. He is now facing (a) South (b) North (c) East (d) West 30 m S Therefore, (a) is the correct answer. Example 72: If south-east direction becomes north, north-east direction © becomes west and so on, then what will west become? === Page 21 === (b) North-east Here, Q is between G and S—this is 100%; whether right (d) South-west or left, it requires more information. Therefore, the posi- tion of Q cannot be determined with the available infor- NE — s w mation. Hence, (c) is the right option. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer.

FRACTIONS Basically, a fraction describes how a part of a group relates to the whole group. Fractions represent complete groups that have been fractured or broken apart in some way. They help us understand how those pieces fit into the original group. When we look at a fraction, we look at the number that represents the pieces (the fractured section) on the top of the division line. Such a number on the top is called the numerator. The number below the line represents how many total parts are in the group. This number is called the denominator. To easily tell these two parts of the frac- tion apart, just remember that denominator and down both start with the letter d.

Common fraction: A common fraction is a num- ber written with a numerator and a denominator, in which both are natural numbers, for example, — and —. === Page 22 === 2. Proper fraction: A proper fraction that is less than 1 is known as proper fraction, such as 5 and 4 A proper fraction has the same name as ratio. 3. Mixed number fraction: It is basically a whole num- ber plus a proper fraction.

For example: — = 4— example 5 DB Divide the numerator by the denominator. Write the quotient (4) and write the remainder (1) as the numera- tor of the fraction, do not change the denominator. Fractions can be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided also. A fraction in which there is no common factor, except 1, in its numerator and denominator is called a fraction in the simplest or lowest form. Fractions with same denominators are called like frac- tions and if the denominators are different, then they are called unlike fractions. ; ° Fractions can be compared by converting them into like fractions and then arranging them in ascending or descending order. ° Addition (or subtraction) of like fractions is mostly done by adding (or subtracting) their numerators. Addition (or subtraction) of unlike fractions can be done by converting them into like fractions. ° Fractions with denominators 10,100, etc., can be written in a form, using a decimal point called deci- mal numbers or decimals. ¢ Decimal numbers can be compared by using the idea of place value; then they can be arranged in ascend- ing or descending order. ° Decimals can be added (or subtracted) by writing them with equal number of decimal places. ° Many of our daily life problems can be solved by converting different units of measurements, such as money, length and weight, in the decimal form and then adding (or subtracting) them. Example 77: In a class, 3p of the students do not know either English or Hindi. But = th of the students know English.

Summary:
Proper fractions are less than 1, mixed number fractions include a whole number and a proper fraction, improper fractions are equal to or greater than 1, fractions can be converted and operated on, and fractions can be compared and written as decimals for easier calculations.

descending order is 13° 17° 8 ,11 5 Answer: — 13° 17° 8 Example 82: Eiffel Tower’s ath part is painted bronze. 4 th of the remaining part is painted maroon. Rest of the Eiffel Tower has golden colour. If the height of this golden- coloured part is 450 m, then what is Eiffel Tower’s height? (a) 2,250 m (b) 1,250 m (c) 1,000 m (d) 750m Explanation Let’s assume that length of Eiffel Tower is 100m. : th of 100 = 20 mis bronze. ; th ofthe remaining = z thof (100-20) = 20 mis maroon. Rest = 100 — 20 - 20 = 60 m is golden. If golden part is 60m, then total height = 100 m if golden part is 1m, then total height = 100 / 60m If golden part is 450m, then total height = 100/60 x 450 = 750m Therefore, the actual height of Eiffel tower is 750 mm. (d) is the right answer. Time AND DISTANCE If speed, time and distance are denoted by S, T and D, respectively, then S = 7?

x% of 180.5 = 36.1. x% = 36.1 180.5 x= (36.1/180.5) x 100 = 20% Example 94: A mixture contains milk and water in the ratio of 8:3. On adding 3 litres of water, the ratio of milk of water becomes 2:1. Find the quantities of milk and water in the mixture. (a) 20 and 9 (c) 12and15 Solution: (b) 9 and 24 (d) 24 and 12 Let the original quantities of milk and water be 8a and 3a. After adding 3 L of water. 8a (3a + 3) = 2/1 8a = 6a + 6 2a=6;a=3 Hence, milk = 8 x3 = 24Land water = 3x3+3=12L This can be verified as present ratio = 24L:12L=2:1 Hence (d) is the answer. Example 95: If 30 men do a piece of work in 27 days, in what time can 18 men do another piece of workthat is 3 times bigger?. (a) 120 days (c) 150 days Solution: We work on the principle of less men, more days and more work, more days. Given that 30 men do 1 piece of work in 27 days Then, 1 men can do 1 piece of work in 27 x 30 days There 18 men can do 3 pieces (times bigger) work in (27 x 30 x 3)/18 days (b) 135 days (d) 180 days 27x30x3 Hence (b) is the right answer. .. the reqd. no. of days = =135 days === Page 26 === Example 96: If 15 men or 24 women or 36 boys do a piece of work in 12 days, working 8 hrs a day, how many men must be associated with 12 women and 6 boys to do another piece of work 27 times as great in 30 days working 6 hrs a day? (a) 5 (b) 8 Solution: We can make use of following reasoning. (1) More days : less men. (2) Less working hrs : more men. (3) More work : more men. Therefore, by the rule of three, (c) 10 (d) 12 30 days : 12 days 6 hrs : Shrs ::15men: the reqd. no. of men 1lwork : 2--works 15x12x8x2.25 th d. no. of = =18 e reqd. no. of men 30x6x1 Now, we have, 24 women = 15 men “12 women =7.5men And also, 36 boys = 15men .6 boys -2- 2-2, 5men “.12 women + 6 boys = 7.5 + 2.5 = 10men So, 18-10=8men must be associated. Thus, (b) is the correct answer. Example 97; A certain sum of money is divided among A, B and C such that for each rupee A has 65 paise and C has 40 paise. If C’s share is €8, find the sum of money. (a) %35 (b) 38 (c) 41 (d) 45 Solution: Here A: B:C=100:65:40=20:13:8 Their Total = 20+ 13+8=41 As a of the whole sum = 8 “.

er does it mean that India won 50 matches nor es it mean that India won 0.5 matches. It means that ia played 100 matches and won 50 match. Now assume that India.won 40% of matches that it yed in 2015. We have to calculate how many matches ctually won, and for that, we ought to know the total matches played, say, for example, 25 matches. Thus, if ia had played a total of 25 matches, then it would have yon 40% of 25 = i x 25 = 10 matches. Percent in the simplest sense means per cent, that is, yer hundred. For example, 15% = ie =0.15. 1, To convert any per cent as a part or multiple of 1, divide it by 100, Examples: 4% = 0.04, 40% = 0.4 and 400% =4. 2, Conversely, to write any number in the percentage form, multiply it with 100 and append a % symbol. Example: 2 = 200%, 0.2 = 20%, 0.02 = 2% and 0.002 =0.2%. s seen above, x% is nothing but a fraction with numera- or x and denominator 100. Identifying certain percent- ges in the reduced form of the fractions can be very use- |. For example, whenever we have to calculate 20%, essel le can calculate 2° =i. Similarly, the ratio 3 can be 100 5 5 xpressed as —— , that is, 60%. 100 1 We assume that 1 is equal to 100%, then 27 50%, 3 = 16.66%, 37 12.5%, 33.33%, 4 = = 20%, ise an 1 0 =8,33%, +. =6.25%, —- =5% and soon. 2 16 20 If we were to convert 3/8 to percentage, simply ultiply its percentage equivalent of 1/8 by 3. Then, we tan answer 3 x 12.5% = 37.5%. 25% L ithe price of a commodity increases by 25%, then by how much percentage, a household should decrease his con- sumption so that his total expenditure remains the same? (a) 15% (b) 18% (c) 20% (d) 30% Let both consumption and prices are 100 each. Total expenditure = price x consumption = 100 x 100 If price increases, then consumption will come down as we have to keep the total expenditure same. 100 x 100 = (100 - x) x (100 + 25) x= 20% Hence, (c) is the correct answer. Alternatively, such problems can be solved by the follow- ing methods also.

Summary:
The concept of percentages is explained, including how to calculate percentages, convert them to fractions, and solve problems involving percentage changes in expenditure.

n as we have to keep the total expenditure same. 100 x 100 = (100 - x) x (100 + 25) x= 20% Hence, (c) is the correct answer. Alternatively, such problems can be solved by the follow- ing methods also. If the price of a commodity increases by r%, then the reduction in consumption so as not to increase the expen- diture, is “es x 100} 100+r If the price of a commodity decreases by r%, then increase in consumption, so as not to decrease expenditure on this item, is | r +100 }% 100-r Example 101: Express 12% as a fraction? 2 3. (@ 35 ) 55 (9) 35 O75 Solution: 12% = 12.3 100 25 Hence, (b) is the correct answer. Example 102: If two litres of water is evaporated on boiling from 8 litres of sugar solution containing 5% sugar, find the percentage of sugar in the remaining solution? (a) 65% (b) 8% (c) 9% (d) 10% Solution: As sugar does not evaporate, its quantity will remain same in the remaining solution, that is 8-2 =6 litres of solution. 5% of 8 = x% of 6 Thus, x= Gx8) Thus, (a) = 6 2/3 % is the correct answer. Short cut formula Suppose a quantity (such as price or salary) increases or decreases first by x%, and then by y%. What is the net increase or decrease in the price? Net increase =x + y + (=). This formula is used where ‘two’ quantities are to be multiplied as per formula === Page 28 === or requirement of the question, and one or both of these quantities may increase or decrease. Example 103; The price of a commodity increases first by 20% and then by 10%. What is the net increase in the price? Solution: Let original price = 100 Price after first increase = 100 + 20= 120 Price after second increase = 120 + (10% of 120) = 132 Net increase = 132 — 100 = 32% Direct formula = 20 + 10+ [(20 x 10)/100] =32% Example 104; On allowing two successive discounts of 20% and 15%. The selling price of an article becomes ~3060. What is the marked price of the article? (September 2022) (a) ¥4000 (b) 4100 (c) 4200 (d) ¥4500 Solution: Let Marked Price = X After 1% 20% discount, the discounted price = 0.80X After 2° 15% discount, the discounted price = (0.85) (0.80)X that is given to be 3060.

So, (0.85) (0.80)X = 3060 X = (3060 x 100 x 100) / (85)(80) = Rs 4500 Thus, (d) is the correct answer. Example 105: The price of acommodity is first increased by 40% and then reduced by 20%. What is the net increase or decrease in the price? Solution: Let the original price = 100 Price after increase = 100 + 40 = 140 Price after decrease = 140 — (20% of 140) = 112 Net increase in price = 112 — 100 = 12% Direct formula = 40 — 20 + [40 x (—20)]/100] = 12% Example 106: A’s income is 70% of B’s income. B’s income is 50% of C’s income. If C’s income is 1,00,000, then what is A’s income? Solution: B’s income = (=) xX 1,00,000 = %50,000 A’s income = (2) x 50,000= $35,000 Alternative method _ A’s income = 70% of 50% of %1,00,000 = ¥35,000 Example 107: The income of A is 60% of the income of B.

Let CP of dealer = 7100 Profit = %8 ‘SP = 100 + 8 = 2108 _ Discount = 710 Let us make other assumption to calculate SP after dis- count of 10. Now SP = %100 Net SP = $100 - Rs 10 = %90 If Net SP is 90 then SP = %100 If Net SP is 1 then SP = 100/90 % If Net SP is 108 then SP = 100/90 x 108 = €120 As per question again If CP is 100 then SP = $120 If CP is Rs 1,35,000 then SP = 120/100 x 1,35,000 = = 1,62,000 Therefore, (c) is the correct answer.

(a) %430 (b) %450 (c) %220 (d) 400 Solution: Let C.P. of the article = 100 Thus, old S.P. = 108 New C.P. = 90 ; As the profit is 15%, so the new SP = 90 x (115/100) = %103.5. :. The difference in the two S.P. = 108-103.5 = 24.5. If difference in S.P. is Rs 4.5, then C.P. = $100 If difference in S.P. is 18, then C.P. = (100/4.5) x 18 = =400.

give some house for a rent, we get rent on it. Similarly, when we lend money to a borrower, the bor- rower is to pay an extra amount of money to the lender. This extra money is known as the interest. If the interest on a sum borrowed for a certain period is reckoned uni- formly, then it is called simple interest or the flat rate. Principal The money borrowed or lent out for a certain period is called the principal or the sum. It is denoted by P. Simple Interest Calculations Interest is the extra money that the borrower pays for using the lender’s money. Simple interest is denoted by S.I. Simple interest (S.I.) =P x R x T/100. Here, Rand T are basically rate of interest and time. S. Principal amount is P = 100 x RxD T=100x R=100x (PxT === Page 34 === Compounp INTEREST Here, we are exploring some simple questions on compound interest as per NTA-NET exam pattern. Compound interest is basically an amount paid not only on the principal amount but also on whatever interest has been paid already. In other words, interest amount is also added to the original principal amount and that earns interest on the total investment. Interest accumulated over one period is applied to ~ the principal before calculating the interest for the next period. Typical intervals are quarterly (four times a year), monthly, daily and on a regular basis. The formula for compound interest is given as follows: Compound interest =A —P where A is the amount to be available at the end of A= P| 1+——| period.. Example 126: How much time will it take for an amount of %900 to yield %81 as interest at 4.5% per annum of simple interest?

(a) 32 km/h (b) 34.3 km/h (c) 36.3 km/h (d) 38 km/h Solution: If x and y and z are two speeds during the journey, we can use the following formula to calculate the average speed = (x+y) Average speed = @ x40 x30) (40 + 30) = 2x40 30) 39) _ 34.3 km/hr Hence, (b) is the correct answer. Example 141: A train starts full of passengers. At the first station, it drops one-third of these and takes in 96 more. At the next, it drops one-half of the new total and takes in 12 more. On reaching the next station, there are found to be 248 left. With how many passengers has the train started with? (a) 464 (b) 520 (c) 564 (d) 680 Solution: Let the train start with X passengers. After dropping one-third and taking in 96 passengers, the train has 2X 96 _2x +288 At the second station, the number of passengers _ 2x+288 + 2x +288 X- 3 +96= Passengers Now, +12=248 Or, 2x + 288 =1416 “ x= 564 Thus, (c) is the correct answer. ~ Example 142: There were 35 students in a hostel. jg the number of students increases by 7, the expenses of the mess increase by %42 per day while the average expenditure per head diminished by %1. Find the origina] expenditure of the mess (a) 450 (b) 500 (c) 400 (d) 420 Solution: Suppose the average expenditure was &x Total expenditure = 35x According to question Average expenditure = 35x+ 42) =x~-1 35x +42 = 42x — 42 Thus, the original expenditure of the mess = 35 x 12=%420 Hence (d) is the correct answer. HG Example 143: One third of a certain journey is covered at the rate of 25 km/h, one fourth at the rate of 30 km/h, and the rest at 50 km/h. Find the average speed of whole journey. (a) 34 km/h (b) 33 = km/h (c) 35 km/h (d) 325 kan/h Solution: Let the total journey be x km. Then 3 km travelled at the speed of 25 km/h and t km at 30 km/hr and the rest of distance (x — 5 - 2 = was travelled at the speed of 50 km/h.

Summary:
The average speed of the entire journey is 33.5 km/h.

We need to be familiar with a few concepts. It is necessary to know the concept of ‘odd days’ to solve calendar problems. We are supposed to find the day of the week on a given date. Odd days: In a given period, the number of days more than the complete weeks is called odd days. © Leap year: A leap year has 366 days. Every year divisible by 4 is a leap year, but not if it is a century. Only every fourth century year is a leap year.

Summary:
The average speed of a journey is 33.3 km/h, the percentage of female employees is 50%, and the temperature on Wednesday was 39°C.

Title: Counting Odd Days and Day of the Week

Text:
than the complete weeks is called odd days. © Leap year: A leap year has 366 days. Every year divisible by 4 is a leap year, but not if it is a century. Only every fourth century year is a leap year. Examples: Each of the years, such as 1880, 1988, 2004, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, is a leap year. Each of the years, such as 400, 800, 1200, 1600 and 2000, is a leap year, but 1700, 1800, 1900, and so on are not leap years. CouNTING oF Opp Days 01 January 0001 is assumed to be a Monday. 1 ordinary year = 365 days = 52 weeks + ‘1 day’. That 1 extra day is counted as odd day. 1 leap year = 366 days = (52 weeks + 2 days) 1 leap year has 2 odd days. 100 years = 76 ordinary years + 24 leap years = (76 x 1+ 24 x 2) odd days = 124 odd days = (17 weeks + 5 days). It means 5 odd days. Therefore, the number of odd days in 100 years is 5. Number of odd days in 200 years = (5 x 2) = 10 days. If further divided by 7, then it gives us 3 odd days. Number of odd days in 300 years = (5 x 3) = 15 days, which means ‘1 odd day’. Number of odd days in 400 years = (5 x 4+ 1) =0 odd day Similarly, each one of 800th year, 1200th year, 1600th year, 2000th year, 2400th year, and so on has 0 odd day. Day oF THE Week RELATED To Opp Days We usually count days from Sunday. For example, if as per our calculation the number of ‘odd days’ is 2, then it means that the answer will be Tuesday. Saturday | Friday | === Page 38 === Example 147: What was the day of the week on 1 January 2001? [June 2009] (a) Friday (b) Tuesday (c) Sunday (d) Wednesday Explanation By the end of centuries 400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2400 and so on, there are no extra days left. It means that the last year 2000 was Sunday. As per convention, the week starts with Monday and hence, the next day after last day of year 2000, that is, 1 January 2001, is Monday. Therefore, (b) is the correct answer. Example 148: 1 January 1995 was a Sunday. What would be the day of the week on 1 January 1996? [December 2009] (a) Sunday (b) Monday (c) Wednesday (d) Saturday Explanation There is an increase of 1 day (odd day) in the subsequent year. In case of a leap year (if the day is after February), there will be an increase of 2 days.

Summary:
Odd days are extra days in a year that do not fit into complete weeks, with leap years having 366 days and every fourth century year being a leap year, and the day of the week can be determined based on the number of odd days in a given year.

Title: Days of the Week and Calendar Dates

Text:
onday (c) Wednesday (d) Saturday Explanation There is an increase of 1 day (odd day) in the subsequent year. In case of a leap year (if the day is after February), there will be an increase of 2 days. Although 1996 is a leap year, the day in question is in January, so there will be an increase of 1 day. Thus, 1 January 1996 is Monday. Therefore, (b) is the correct answer. Example 149: On 12 January 1980, it was a Saturday. The day of week on 12 January 1979 was a (a) Thursday (b) Friday (c) Saturday (d) Sunday Explanation Although 1980 is a leap year, it would not have any impact on the calculation as the date in the question is in January month (and before 28 February). Thus, it is assumed as a normal year. There is a gain of 1 day in the next year. However, here, we will do backward calculation, and subtract 1 day from the year 1980. If it was Saturday, then the same day in the previous year was to be Friday. Therefore, (b) is the correct answer. Example 150: If 1 October is Monday, then 1 November will be (a) Thursday (b) Friday - (c) Sunday (d) Monday Explanation October has 31 days. 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29 dates of October will be Mondays. Thus, 1 November will be a Thursday. Therefore, (a) is the correct answer. Example 151: If the first day of the month is Sunday, then what date will be 3 days after the fourth Wednesday in the month? [June 1998] (a) 24 (b) 29 (c) 27 (d) 30 Explanation First Wednesday of the month will be on 4th day of the month, 2nd Wednesday will be on 11th, 3rd Wednesday on 18th and 4th Wednesday on 25th. Now, 3 days afte. 25th, which means 25 + 4 = 29th day of the month. Therefore, (b) is the correct answer. Example 152: If the first day of the ordinary year (othe; than the leap year) was Friday, then which was the la day of that year? (a) Wednesday (b) Thursday (c) Friday (d) Sunday Explanation An ordinary year has 365 days. Week starting with Friday will end in Thursday. Hence, the 364th day (end of com. plete 52 weeks) will be Thursday. The 365th day will be Friday. Thus, the first and last days of an ordinary year are same. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer. a | Solution: Example 153: It was Monday on 1 January 2007. What.

Summary:
The day of the week on a specific date can be determined by considering the number of days in a year, whether it is a leap year, and the day of the week on a given date.

What. was the day of the week on 1 January 2011? (a) Sunday (b) Saturday (c) Friday (d) Wednesday Explanation Odd days in 2007 = 1 (2007 is an ordinary year and we are doing calculation from January 1) Odd days in 2008 = 2 (2008 is a leap year) Odd days in 2009 = 1 (ordinary year) Odd days in 2010 = 1 (ordinary year) Thus, 1 January 2011 will be Monday plus 5 days, that is, Saturday. Therefore, (b) is the correct answer. Example 154: If the 4th Saturday of a month is the 22nd day, then what day is the 13th day of the month? (a) Tuesday (b) Wednesday (c) Thursday (d) Friday Explanation The earlier 3 Saturdays are on 15th, 8th and Ist. If 15th is Saturday, Thursday falls on 13th. Thus, 13th is Thursday. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer. Angle (between minute hour and hour hand) = [(11/2) M — 30H)] where M shows minutes and H shows hours. 155.

While the circles or figures (also called sets) deal with individual data items, the number shown in rectangle is the total number (rectan- gle is also known as universal set). There can be other shapes such as triangles and squares to represent data. The following examples will help in better understanding on how to solve questions on Venn diagrams. The main aim of this section is to test your ability about the relation between some items of a group by diagrams. In these questions, some figures of circles and some words are given. You have to choose a figure that represents the given words. Some critical examples are as follows: 1. If all the words are of different groups, then they will be shown by the diagram as follows: Dog, Cow and Horse All these three are animals but of different groups, and there is no relation between them.

Summary:
The question asks how many distinct points two runners will meet on a circular track with different speeds, with the answer being 11 points.

all the words are of different groups, then they will be shown by the diagram as follows: Dog, Cow and Horse All these three are animals but of different groups, and there is no relation between them. Hence, they will be represented by three different circles. 2. If few words belong to acommon group: | Cow, Horse and Mammals Mammals Co) (sm) 3. If one word belongs to a second group that further belongs to the third group: Gow, Mammais and Animal kingdom === Page 40 === Mammals Animal kingdom 4. If there is some relation between two items and these two items are completely related to a third item, then they will be shown as follows: Men, Brother and Father Brother Some brothers may be fathers and vice versa. Similarly, some fathers may not be bothers and vice versa. But all the fathers and all the brothers belong to the group men. 5. Two items are related to a third item to some extent but not completely and the first two items are totally different: Students, Boys and Girls The boys and girls are different genders while some boys may be students. Similarly, among girls, some may be students. 6. All the three items are related to one another but to some extent and not completely: Boys, Students and Athletes Chapters | Some boys may be students and vice versa. Some boys may be athletes and vice versa. Some students may be athletes and vice versa. 7. Two items are related to each other completely and the. third item is entirely different from the first two: Lions, Carnivorous and Cows Carnivorous animals Alllions are carnivorous but no cowisa lion oracarnivore. 8. The first item is partially related to the second, but the - third is entirely different from the first two: Dogs, Flesh eaters and Cows Flesh eaters Some dogs are flesh eaters but not all, whereas any | dog or any flesh eater cannot be cow. There can be many other situations too. Now, we discuss Venn diagram to solve mathemati- cal problems. This can be used as an easier approach to solve problems, which can be practised by students from non-mathematical background also. Example 160: Ina class, there are: (a) 8 students who play football and hockey. (b) 7 students who do not play football'or hockey.

Summary:
The Venn diagram is used to visually represent relationships between different groups of words or items, with examples given to illustrate various scenarios such as animals, genders, and sports.

There are 13 students who play hockey, so the numbers he hockey circle should add up to 13. There are 8 students in the intersection, so there are 5 Thus, the total number of students in the class = 11+8 5+7=31. here are 31 students in the class. xample 161: In a class, there are 30 students. ) 21 students like Maths. ) 16 students like English. ) 6 students don’t like Maths or English. _ ow many students like both Maths and English? The 6 students who do not like either of the two subjects go outside because they should not be in either circles. We know that the total in the Maths circle needs to be 21, but we cannot put this in because we don’t know how many should go inside the intersection (if they like both subjects) and ‘how many should go on the left (if they like only Maths). Step II 21 in total like Maths There are 30 students in the class, and if there are 6 stu- dents outside the circles, then the other 3 sections must add up to 24. Furthermore, there are 21 students who like Maths, so the middle and left sections must add up to 21. This leaves 3 on the right as 24-21=3. Step III There are 16 students who like English. Hence, the 2 parts of the English circle should add up to 16 and so we can find the number in the intersection by doing 16-3 = 13. There are 21 students who like Maths. There are 8 (got by 21 — 13) who like Maths but not English. If we check all the four facts given to us, then we can see that they are all true.

Then third discount will be taken into account. The basic formula will be (X + Y—XY/100) = 10 +20- (10 x 20/100)% = 30 — (200/100)% = (30 — 2)% = 28% Thus, we get the ratio. As a matter of fact, their total. Now, we want to see the impact of this calculated dis- count of 28% and 25% with same formula. = [28 + 25 — (28 x 25/100)]% = (53-7) % = 46% Thus, the statement A is true. Question Part B CP of mobile = 18225, Loss = 20%, SP (given) = 14500 We can directly calculate SP. , SP = 18225 x (100 -20)/100 = 18225 x 4/5 =% 14580 Thus, calculated SP does not tally with the given SP, so it’s a wrong statement. Question Part C Let loss = x and selling price = 3x Loss = CP — SP X = CP~3X CP =X + 3X = 4X Now % age loss = 4X — 3X/ 4X x 100 = 25% Hence, statement C is a false statement.

Statement II: At 5.6% rate of simple interest, a certain sum will be doubled in 15 years. In light of the above statements, choose the correct answer from the options given below: (a) Both Statement I and Statement II are true (b) Both Statement I and Statement II are false ' (c) Statement I is true but Statement II is false (d) Statement I is false but Statement II is true Solution: Statement I: Compound Interest = SI of First year + SI for 1/2 year (on total amount of first year) SI for first year = 10% of 280 = %28 Principal for next six months = 280 + 28 = 308 SI for these six months = 308 x5 x 1/100 = 15.40 Thus, total interest = ¥28 + ¥15.40 = %43.40 This question can be directly solved by compound interest formula. There is difference of 10 paisa in calculated amount and given amount of % 43.3 in the statement. Thus, it is not correct. Statement 2: As the amount is calculated on SI, that amount will remain the same through 15 years. Thus, in 15 years, the principal amount of ¥100 will add 15 x 5.6 = %84. So, it is not doubling. This statement is also wrong. 174. A total of 324 coins of 20 paise and 25 paise make a sum of 71.

(b) === Page 22 === Number Series COMPLETION 4, (c): Each number is half of its preceding number. 9, (a): +5, +10, +15, +20, +25, +30. 3, (c): +3, +6, +9, +12. 4, (b): In first row, it is -2; in second row, it is +2, and in third row, it is +2. 5, (c): Multiply the first by 3 and divide the number so obtained by 2. This is to be done alternatively for all other numbers. 6, (b): 10--100, 10 ~ 100 and so on. 7, (d): The pattern is +5, —2, +5, —2,.... ing term = 36 -2=34, g, (b): The sum of any three consecutive terms of the series is given to the next term. Hence, missing num- ber =8+15+27=50. 9, (a): The second number is the square of the first num- ber; the fourth number is the square of the third num- ber. Similarly, the sixth number should be the square of the fifth number. Hence, the answer is 16, that is, square root of 256. 10. (d): The numerator increases by addition of 2, 3, 4 and 5. The denominator increases by addition of 4, 6, 8 and 10. 11, (d): Prime numbers (numbers that are divisible by 1 and themselves only) starting with 2 are being added to each number to get the subsequent numbers. Thus, the sequence of numbers can be read as 125, 125 + 2, 127+ 3, 130+5, 135+7,142+11 and 153+ 13. Hence, the last number should be 166. 12. (c): Each term in the series is obtained by adding 1 to the square of the preceding term. Hence, the missing term = (101)*+ 1 =10,202. 13. (b): It is a question of mixed series. (i) Numbers at Ist, 3rd, 5th, and 7th places are squares of 1, 2,3 and 4, Gi) Numbers at 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th places are cubes of 1, 2,3, 4 and 5. Hence, the answer is 4° = 64. 14, (a): The pattern is: 3x14+2=5 5x2+3=13 13x3+4=43 43 x44+5=177 177x5+6=891 Hence, (a) is the answer. 15. (b): The given sequence is a combination of two series: (i) 3, 7, 13, 21, 31, ? and (ii) 4, 7, 13, 22, 34 The pattern in (i) is+ 4,+6,+8,+10,.... The pattern in (ii) is+ 3,4+6,+9,+12,.... Hence, the missing term =31+12=43. Hence, the miss- ‘SOLUTION 16. (d): 10x 2+ 4=24; 24x2+4=52; 52x2+4=108; and so on. 17. (a): The given series consists of cubes of natural num. bers only. The number 256 is not the cube of any nat ral number. 18.

Summary:
The sequence consists of numbers following specific patterns, such as doubling, adding multiples, and squaring, with the missing number being determined by these patterns.

The first and third let- ters are swapping their position in second and fourth terms. The first letters are in alphabetical order: F, G, H, land J. The missing segment begins with a new letter J. 23. (c): For first letter of each triplet, the series is STUVW. The remaining two letters of the series go like CD, EF, GH, WJ, KL. 24. (b): This is an alternating series in alphabetical order. The middle letters follow the order ABCDE. The first and third letters of the triplets are in alphabetical order beginning with J. The third letter is repeated as a first letter in each subsequent three-letter segment. 25. (b): If we look at the alphabetic series given in Table 5.1, the difference between first letters of all pairs is 3. Moreover, the difference between two letters in each pair is 10. Hence, MW is the answer. 26. (d): The second and fourth letters in the series, L and T, are static. The first and third letters consist of an alphabetical order beginning with the letter E. 27, (a): First Letter | Second Letter W-4=S |E+2=G || -3=P G+3=J P-4=L J+4=N L-3=I1 |N+5= | Thus, (a) is the right answer. === Page 23 === (a): This series is just like the above series. However, the middle letter of each term is replaced by a number. (a): The third letter is repeated as the first letter “of the next segment. The middle letter, A, remains static.

(b): 16 August 2010 = (2000 + 9 years + period 1.1.2010 to 16.8.2010) Odd days in 2000 years = 0 9 years = (Z leap years + 7 ordinary years) =(2x2+ 7 x 1) =11 odd days 11 can be divided by 7 = 4 odd days d 31 28 31 30 31 16 31 16 228 The odd days can be calculated for each month sepa- rately and then added up. This can save some time in calculation. Such as January has 3 odd days (31 divided by 7 gives remainder of 3 and so on). Now, 228 days = 32 complete weeks + 3 extra days; it means 3 odd days. Total number of odd days = (0 + 0 + 4 + 4) = 8; it means 1 odd day. Thus, 16 August 2010 was Monday. — (c): From 15 August 2012 to 15 August 2013, there is 1 extra day. In the rest of 16 days of August, there are 2 odd days. In September, there are 2 odd days, and in October, 3 odd days. In the first 15 days of November, there will be 1 odd day. Thus, the total number of odd daysis1+2+2+3+1 = 9; it means 2 extra (odd) days. Hence, 15 Novem- ber 2013 was Friday. (b): Each day of the week is repeated after 7 days. Assuming that the first day is Sunday, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50 and 57 days will be Sundays. Hence, day 58 is Monday, 59 is Tuesday, and 60 is Wednesday. Hence, day after 60 days will be Thursday. === Page 32 === 227. (a): The year 2012 is a leap year. Thus, it has 2 odd days. Bur as calculation is to be done from 22 April 2012 to 22 April 2013, so it has 1 odd day only. As the cal- culation is to be done backwards, 22 April was 1 day less. Thus, it was Sunday.

Summary:
Calculating odd days for various years and periods, the day asked in the question was determined to be Wednesday, Monday, and Friday for different dates.

2 odd days. Bur as calculation is to be done from 22 April 2012 to 22 April 2013, so it has 1 odd day only. As the cal- culation is to be done backwards, 22 April was 1 day less. Thus, it was Sunday. Note: Had the question been about 22 April 2014, the answer would have been Tuesday. If the same ques- tion is framed for 22 April 2016, the answer would have been Friday, as 2016 is a leap year. 228.(a): 1 April 2001 = (2000 years + period from 1.1.2001 to 1.4.2001) Odd days in 2000 years = 0 Now, calculate the odd days for the year 2001. 31 28 310 1 91 91 divided by 7 gives 0 as remainder, so, odd days can be counted as 0. Total number of odd days = (0+ 0) =0 On 1 April 2001, it was Sunday. 229. (c): 100 years contain 5 odd days. Last day of the first century is Friday. 200 years contain (5 x 2) = 3 odd days. Last day of the second century is Wednesday. 300 years contain (5 x 3) = 15 odd days, that is, equal to 1 odd day. Last day of the third century is Monday. 400 years contain 0 odd days. Last day of the fourth century is Sunday. This cycle is repeated. Last day of a century cannot be Tuesday or Thursday or Saturday. 230. (c): The year 2004 is a leap year. It has 2 odd days. Hence, 10 February 2004, was Tuesday, and 8 February 2004 must be Sunday. Venn DIAGRAMS 231.

Newton’s Apple Story: There is well-known story of Newton sitting under an apple tree, where an appie fall- | ing on his head is said to have inspired his thinking about the Universal Law of Gravitation. This story illustrates the process of an idea becoming explicit knowledge. Implicit versus Explicit Knowledge: Before New- ton’s realization, apples were falling to Earth, but the understanding of gravity was implicit and not formal- ized into a theory. What Newton did was make this implicit knowledge explicit through the formulation of the Universal Law of Gravitation. 2. Knowledge and Theories: The development of theo- ries is essential for understanding the world and solv- ing problems. 3. The Importance of Reasoning: In life, many prob- lems require solutions. Reasoning is a crucial tool in solving these problems.

ries is essential for understanding the world and solv- ing problems. 3. The Importance of Reasoning: In life, many prob- lems require solutions. Reasoning is a crucial tool in solving these problems. It helps people differentiate between what is right and what is wrong. The basic types of reasoning are deductive and inductive. 4. Variety of Theories: The different individuals may express or formulate the same theory in various ways. This diversity in approaches leads to progress in life, as it encourages new perspectives and ideas. 5. Logic as a Way of Life: This trains individuals in methods to differentiate between right and wrong. It is a fundamental tool for critical thinking and rational decision-making. 6. Flow of Knowledge: The flow of knowledge occurs in two ways: deductive and inductive reasoning. Deduc- tive reasoning moves from general principles to spe- cific conclusions, while inductive reasoning goes from specific observations to general principles. Just like solving a fun puzzle or playing with Lego bricks, logic is all about making connections and discov- ering new things! Basic Structure of ARGUMENTS An argument, in the context of logic and critical think- ing, is a set of statements, propositions and conclusions. Premises intend to provide evidence or-reasons to accept the conclusion. Logical argument Evidence/ Accepted facts Inference What is claimed to follow rom the evidence? Ficure 6.1 1, Premises: These are the statements, claims, or Ppiec of evidence presented to support the conclusio Premises are intended to provide reasons or suppo for accepting the conclusion as true. 2. Conclusion: The conclusion is the statement that th argument seeks to establish or prove. It is the maj point or claim that follows from the premises. Th conclusion is what the arguer wants the audience t accept. 3. Inferential Relationship: This is again based on. arguments. The concept of an inferential relation. ship is linked to both deductive and inductive reason, ing. In deductive reasoning, the inferential relation.

Summary:
Reasoning is essential for solving problems and understanding the world, with deductive and inductive reasoning playing a crucial role in forming arguments and making logical connections.

l Relationship: This is again based on. arguments. The concept of an inferential relation. ship is linked to both deductive and inductive reason, ing. In deductive reasoning, the inferential relation. ship is very strong and strict.In inductive reasoning, the inferential relationship is weaker.We will stud more about these in validity, soundness, strength and cogency. Arguments can take the form of simple everyday con. versations to formal and structured logical arguments used in philosophy, law, and other fields. ; Arguments play a crucial role in critical thinking and reasoning, evaluating evidence, make a case, and per. suade others. The critical thinking involves assessing the strength and validity of arguments, identifying fal lacies, and making informed judgments about the truth or acceptability of conclusions based on the provided evidence. Probable Words in Premises ° The term 'because' serves as an indicator for present ing a reason or premise to support a claim. Proving an argument 'as an argument’ is important to us. ° The claims can be categorized into three main types: Value, Policy, and Factual claims. ° The premises, or supporting reasons, may be intro- duced using various words and phrases like 'as,' ‘due _ to,' ‘as indicated by,' 'for the reason that,' ‘owing to,' ‘through, 'in the view of,' and more. Identifying Concluding Statements ° Conversely, the presence of the word 'therefore' or its synonyms signals the formulation of a conclusion or claim. * Words such as ‘accordingly,’ ‘consequently,’ ‘infer that,' hence,’ 'prove that,' 'conclude that,' and similar terms also signify the conclusion of an argument. Example Illustration e Consider the argument: 'The internet is a valuable invention.’ ° Practically, we get flexible with the use of such words or marks. e In this example, we reinforce the claim that the intet- net is valuable with logical reasons such as 'It is a vast source of information’ and ‘It offers extensive enter- tainment options.' === Page 35 === he logical reasons provided lead us to the conclusion at the internet is indeed a valuable invention.

Summary:
Arguments, whether deductive or inductive, play a crucial role in critical thinking and reasoning by evaluating evidence and making informed judgments based on provided premises and conclusions.

This intends to draw the con- ion in a valid and logically sound manner. Through uctive reasoning, we get an idea about validity, truth, he human brain can pro ably b rm complex tasks. 1. Which of the following is a valid syllogism? (a) All cats are mammals. Some mammals are furry. Therefore, all cats are furry. (b) All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is a mortal. (c) All birds have feathers. Some animals have feath- ers. Therefore, all animals are birds. (d) All dogs are mammals. Some mammals are carni- vores. Therefore, all dogs are carnivores. — Which of the following is an example of a deductive argument? (a) All swans that have been observed have been white. Therefore, all swans are white. (b) If it is raining, then the ground is wet. It is raining. Therefore, the ground is wet. (c) Smoking causes lung cancer. Therefore, I should not smoke. (d) All mammals have four legs. My dog is amammal. Therefore, my dog has four legs. 3. Ina syllogism, the term that appears in both premises but not in the conclusion is called the: (a) Major term (b) Minor term (c) Middle term (d) Predicate term 4. Which of the following represents a valid syllogism? (a) All men are birds. John is a man. Therefore, John is a bird. (b) All birds are animals. Some animals can swim. Therefore, all birds can swim.

(d) Deductive arguments aim to provide logically conclu- sive support for their conclusions while inductive argu- ments aim to provide probable or likely support for their _ conclusions. Deductive reasoning, championed by Aristotle, is seen as a way to attain certainty and approach the truth. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) rightly wrote in the ‘Critique of Pure Reason’ that Aristotle’s theory of logic completely accounted for the core of deductive inference. Thomas Aquinas and Gottlob Frege also made important contribu- tions in deductive reasoning. On the other hand, philosophers like Francis Bacon and J.S. Mill emphasized inductive reasoning as a means to generate new knowledge. The development of the sci- entific method, particularly in the works of figures like Galileo and Newton, further solidified the role of induc- tive reasoning in scientific inquiry. First, we try to get the general idea and then difference between deductive and inductive so that we have some clarity in mind. Depuctive REASONING This set of reasoning moves from a general premise or premises to a specific conclusion. In deductive reasoning, if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. We always aim for certainty in life. It is characterized by a high degree of certainty. === Page 36 === e The structure of a deductive argument often follows this pattern: * Premise 1: General statement * Premise 2: Additional information * Conclusion: A specific, certain statement that logi- cally follows from the premises. Example Premise 1: All humans are mortal. (General) Premise 2: Chanakya is a human. (Cause) Conclusion: Therefore, Chanakya is mortal. (Effect) General: The first premise is a general statement about all humans. It says that all humans are mortal. Cause: The second premise states that Chanakya is a human.

Summary:
Deductive arguments aim to provide logically conclusive support for their conclusions, while inductive arguments aim to provide probable or likely support for their conclusions, with deductive reasoning moving from general premises to specific conclusions and emphasizing certainty, while inductive reasoning generates new knowledge and is important in scientific inquiry.

erefore, Chanakya is mortal. (Effect) General: The first premise is a general statement about all humans. It says that all humans are mortal. Cause: The second premise states that Chanakya is a human. This premise can be seen as the cause of the con- clusion, because it is the reason why Chanakya is mortal. Effect: The conclusion is a specific statement about Chanakya. It says that Chanakya is mortal. This con- clusion can be seen as the effect of the cause stated in the second premise. As we discussed, deductive reasoning is a logical process that leads to conclusions with a high degree of certainty. It is a method of thinking that is foundational in the field of logic. The example of a valid form of deductive reasoning known as a categorical syllogism is given as under: Premise 1: All A are B. Premise 2: Cis an A. Conclusion: Therefore, C is a B. Deductive Waterfall Figure 6.2 Deductive vs. Inductive INDUCTIVE REASONING e The structure of an inductive argument may look like this Specific Observations (Causes): 1. Chanakya is a man. 2. Another man, John, is mortal. 3. Yet another man, Sarah, is mortal. ¢ There is always a ‘inductive leap' from certain te ’ uncertain, from particular to general, because th conclusion tends to contain more information tha the premises. This leap is based on two: 1. Law of Uniformity of Nature: This says tha, under similar conditions nature behaves in a sim, ilar manner — that is future repeats the past. 2. Law of Causation: Every event has a cause, gq if X is the cause of Y, whenever there is X, it wi always be followed by Y. * Observation (or Premise) 1: Specific instance or data point : * Observation (or Premise) 2: Additional specific instance or data 4 * Inductive Conclusion: A general statement or hypothesis based on the observed instances, Here is an example of an inductive argument: Observation 1: All swans that I have ever seen are white. Observation 2: The swan that I am looking at now is white.

Summary:
Chanakya is mortal because he is a human, which is a general premise that all humans are mortal, leading to a specific conclusion about Chanakya's mortality.

Deductive reasoning r is also provides a high degree of certainty in its conclusions. If the premises are true and the reasoning is valid, the conclusion is certain, it is deterministic in nature. Inductive reasoning offers conclusions based on observations, which may not provide the same level of certainty.Inductive arguments are not final but pro- _ vide working explanations or solutions. Examples: After observing multiple instances of differ- ent birds flying, you might induce the general theory that ‘birds can fly.' Ifyou observe that every time you water a plant, it grows, you might inductively reason that watering plants helps them grow. However, this conclusion is not certain but probable, it is called as ‘probabilistic’ in nature.

ry time you water a plant, it grows, you might inductively reason that watering plants helps them grow. However, this conclusion is not certain but probable, it is called as ‘probabilistic’ in nature. The inductive is based on this principle of uniformity of nature. This is also known as the principle of the uniformity of nature, is a fundamental assumption in inductive reasoning. It is the idea that the natural world operates in a consistent and uniform manner, meaning that the same causes will generally produce the same effects under similar conditions. EGREE OF SCALABILITY ° Deductive reasoning can be applied broadly to entire categories or classes of elements.There is no inherent limit to the number of premises that can lead to con- clusions. In the example, 'l am a man’ can be extended to include ‘you are a man,'‘he is a man,’ 'she is a man,' and so on. Deductive reasoning encompasses the entire class of elements (the whole class) and leaves nothing excluded. This deterministic and scientific approach, is often referred to as 'the science of deduction. e Inductive reasoning is based on specific observations and may not encompass entire categories. Movine FRom GENERAL To SPEcIFIC ¢ Deductive reasoning involves moving from a general theory to specific premises. e Inductive reasoning typically moves from specific observations to broader theories. ANALYTICAL AND ReFtective Nature e Deductive reasoning requires deep analytical and reflective thinking. e Inductive reasoning relies on observations and experience. ACCEPTANCE OF PREMISES e Deductive reasoning accepts premises as true. ¢ Inductive reasoning evaluates the accuracy of prem- ises and conclusions. A Priori vs. A Posterior ° Deductive reasoning is a priori in nature, meaning it is independent of sensory experience and is based on a prior knowledge that precedes empirical observations. For example, all sides of a square are equal to each other is a priori information. This statement is derived from the definition of a square and is universally true for all squares, making it a priori within the realm of geometry.

Summary:
Inductive reasoning is based on specific observations and the principle of uniformity of nature, while deductive reasoning involves moving from general theories to specific premises and is often referred to as 'the science of deduction.'

This statement is derived from the definition of a square and is universally true for all squares, making it a priori within the realm of geometry. Similarly, side of a right angled triangled triangle can be calculated with the help of a popular universal formula. The other examples are Newton’s Gravitational law, Kepler laws and so on. ¢ Inductive reasoning is a posteriori knowledge that is based on sensory experience and observations. This is also called as ‘after experience’ knowledge. The knowledge is supposed to be acquired after ‘sensory experience’. Inductive reasoning is innovative because it allows for the acquisition of new knowledge based on observations. Example: Weather forecasting is an example of induc- tive reasoning where meteorologists use past weather data to predict future weather conditions based on probability.

When we move from validity towards soundness, the Valid and truth comes into picture. We need to add truth to validity to make an argument sound. Let’s see, what the truth is ? Truth (or Falsity): Within a deductive argument, the individual statements or premises can be classified as either true or false. In a ‘sound deductive argument’, in addition to being valid, requires that all premises be true. If any premise within the argument is false, the argument may be logically valid but not sound.

Summary:
Deductive reasoning involves valid arguments that are structured and logical, with soundness requiring both validity and truth in the premises to be considered valid.

For example, a proof that demonstrates the sum of the angles in a triangle always equals 180 degrees is a deductive argument. Categorical Propositions: In formal logic, categorical propositions are used for deductive reasoning. These types of arguments are deductive because they ensure the truth of the conclusion when the premises are true. 4. Conditional Statements: Deductive reasoning is also applied to conditional statements. Let’s look at the following example: Premise 1: If it rains, the ground gets wet. Premise 2: It is raining. Conclusion: Therefore, the ground is wet.

Summary:
A sound deductive argument requires all premises to be true in addition to being valid, with truth referring to the accuracy of both premises and conclusion, and examples of sound arguments include syllogisms, mathematical proofs, categorical propositions, and conditional statements.

asoning is also applied to conditional statements. Let’s look at the following example: Premise 1: If it rains, the ground gets wet. Premise 2: It is raining. Conclusion: Therefore, the ground is wet. This is a deductive argument because the conclusion is certain when the premises are true. As we discussed, inductive reasoning is ‘probabilistic’ in nature, the strength of argument is not dependent on the actual truth of the premises, but on the probabilistic sup- port given by the premises to the conclusion. The‘strength’ and ‘cogent’ demonstrate the ‘degree’ of ‘inductive reason- ing’. Keep in mind that ‘probabilty' is a matter of degree. Collected data (a kind of sample) may also help in this - what is told by smaller and bigger samples to predict. Strength: Strength in inductive reasoning pertains to the degree of support provided by premises for a conclusion. ° It is a probabilistic concept, reflecting varying levels of support in different arguments. ° This continuum of strength encompasses very strong, moderately strong, and relatively weak arguments. ° The assessment of inductive strength considers factors such as the quality and relevance of premises, the sample size of observations, and the diversity of cases examined. ° It plays a crucial role in scientific inquiry, social sci- ences, and everyday decision-making. * Inductive strength enables us to make informed judg- ments and predictions when complete certainty is unattainable. ° Strength is a matter of degree, not a binary concept. Inductive arguments can vary in strength from weak to strong. We can explore the concepts of strong and weak further. Strong inductive Reasoning Let’s take an example first. Premise 1: Over the past 100 years, the sun has risen in the east every day. === Page 40 === Premise 2: Tomorrow will be a day. Conclusion: Therefore, it is likely that the sun will rise in the east tomorrow. Astrong inductive argument is one where the conclusion is more likely to be true based on the available evidence. The strong arguments are able to achieve their targets in a convincing manner.

Summary:
Inductive reasoning involves assessing the strength of arguments based on the degree of support provided by premises, with strong arguments being more likely to be true based on available evidence.

morrow. Astrong inductive argument is one where the conclusion is more likely to be true based on the available evidence. The strong arguments are able to achieve their targets in a convincing manner. The sun rising in the east every day for over a century is strong evidence that it will likely rise in the east tomorrow. However, it doesn't provide absolute certainty due to unforeseen circumstances or exceptions. One more example of an inductively strong argument: Premise 1: Most peacocks eat oats. Premise 2: This bird is a peacock. Conclusion: Thus, probably this bird eats oat. This argument is inductively strong because if all of its premises were true, then it would be highly likely or prob- able that its conclusion would also be true. Weak Inductive Argument Premise 1: Some people from a particular town are friendly. Conclusion: Therefore, all people from that town are friendly. An inductive argument is weak when it achieves its objectives. It fails its objectives. In inductive, it is improbable for the con- clusion to be false when the premises are true. It emans that conclusion is not strongly supported by the premise. The fact that some people from a particular town are friendly doesn’t necessarily mean that all people from that town are friendly. The conclusion is a generalization that goes beyond the avail- able evidence and is therefore considered weak. Recall that inductive arguments can vary in strength. COGENCY Cogency is the final concept that is used to evaluate the inductive arguments. We should note that cogency con- siders both the strength of the argument and the truth of the premises. For an inductive argument to be cogent, it must have a strong connection between the premises and conclusion, and the premises must be true. A cogent argument is persuasive and is likely to be a good basis for making a decision or forming a belief. Example: We can take up the same inductive argument. ¢ Premise 1: Over the last 100 years, the sun has risen every morning. ¢ Premise 2: Tomorrow is a new day. ¢ Conclusion: Therefore, the sun will rise tomorrow.

Summary:
A strong inductive argument is one where the conclusion is more likely to be true based on available evidence, while a weak inductive argument fails to achieve its objectives and may not be strongly supported by the premises, with cogency being the evaluation of the strength and truth of the premises in relation to the conclusion.

can take up the same inductive argument. ¢ Premise 1: Over the last 100 years, the sun has risen every morning. ¢ Premise 2: Tomorrow is a new day. ¢ Conclusion: Therefore, the sun will rise tomorrow. This argument is cogent because it has both a strong connection between the premises and the conclusion (inductive strength) and true premises. While it doesn’t guarantee the sun will rise, it’s a reasonable and cogent prediction based on past observations and the assumption that tomorrow will be similar to previous days. On the other hand, an uncogent argument is an induc- tive argument that lacks strength or has unsupported or less supported premises. An uncogent argument is not persuasive and should not be relied upon for making decisions or forming beliefs. Here, the difference between deductive and inductive ; play of words, otherwise they are not opposed or cont dictory to each other. They are rather complementary and supplementary to one another. They differ mostly in the;, ‘beginning points. ‘Inductive reasoning can be used to generate ne, hypotheses, but it cannot be used to prove conclusion, with certainty. Here, the deductive comes into picture Deductive reasoning can be used to prove conclusions with certainty, as long as the premises are true. : Inductive reasoning is also affected by the presence | negative cases. Hume called deductive reasoning 'demonstrative’ ang inductive reasoning ‘probable.' This is because deductive reasoning is certain, while inductive reasoning is not. J.S. Mill criticized deductive reasoning as 'syllogism, He argued that syllogism is simply a restatement of the premises and does not provide any new knowledge. Immanuel Kant argued that Aristotle focused on deductive reasoning because he believed that certainty 0 being closer to the truth is only attained through deduc tive inference. Modern philosophers, such as Francis Bacon and J.S. Mill, focused on inductive reasoning because they believed that deductive reasoning is powerless to lead to new knowledge. Situation 1 (Deductive Reasoning) ¢ Premise 1: All humans are mortal. (Universal premise ° Premise 2: Donald Trump is a human.

Summary:
Inductive arguments use past observations and assumptions to make reasonable predictions, while deductive arguments use true premises to prove conclusions with certainty, with both types of reasoning being complementary rather than contradictory.

Basic Goncepts in SYLLOGISM Terms These are the basic units of meaning in a sentence or argy. ment. For example, in the sentence 'All humans are mo; tal,' the terms are 'humans' and ‘mortal.' 1. Major Term: This term in syllogism is like a big ideg or headline of an argument, it is actually general o, broader term. It is the predicate of the conclusion tha talks about the subject of the argument. It sums up the conclusion. 2.

is like a big ideg or headline of an argument, it is actually general o, broader term. It is the predicate of the conclusion tha talks about the subject of the argument. It sums up the conclusion. 2. Minor Term: This term is also part of the conclusion and represents the subject, or what the assertion jg about. It’s the more specific term. 3. Middle Term: The middle term is found in both prem, ises but not in the conclusion. Its role is to connect the major and minor terms, creating a bridge that allow us to draw a valid conclusion. Premises We are indeed moving in a reverse manner here. Once we do the conclusion, now we are dividing them into majo and minor premises. Major Premise: This states the relationship between. the major term (often the predicate of the conclusion, and the middle term. Sometimes termed as the general. statement. Minor Premise: The minor premise relates the minor. term (the subject of the conclusion) to the middle term. Sometimes termed as the specific statement. An Example of Three Terms and Two Premises in a_ Syllogism The above are interconnected to form a coherent and valid | deductive argument in a traditional categorical syllo- | gism. The logical validity of the argument depends on the _ proper linkage and relationship among these elements. Example: 1. Major Premise: All birds have feathers 2. Minor Premise: Eagles are birds. 3. Conclusion: Therefore, eagles have feathers. In this example: ® Major Term is 'feathers' (appears in the conclusion). ° Minor Term is 'eagles' (the subject of the conclusion). * Middle Term is 'birds' (common to both premises). Terms and premises are linked in a manner that terms can be used to form premises and also premises can be used to define terms. Fallacy of the Four Terms: This occurs in a syllogism when there are four different terms used, instead of the standard three terms (subject, predicate, and middle term). Example: All cats have fur. This animal has fur. Therefore, it is a warm-blooded creature. Here, there are four terms: cats, fur, animals, and warm-blooded creatures, instead of the required three terms for a valid syllogism.

Summary:
A syllogism consists of three terms - major, minor, and middle - connected by two premises that form a valid deductive argument, with the major premise stating the relationship between the major and middle terms, the minor premise relating the minor term to the middle term, and the conclusion summarizing the argument.

Moods and Figures part of syllabus and have been discussed later as well. {logistic arguments have exactly two premises in medi- ter inferences. They are often categorized into four ndard types based on their form: Categorical Syllogisms: These involve categorical propositions, such as ‘All humans are mortal.' Hypothetical Syllogisms: These deal with conditional statements, like 'If it rains, the ground gets wet.' Disjunctive Syllogisms: These involve disjunctions, such as ‘Either it’s a cat or a dog.' NOTE: Hypothetical and disjunctive are basically non-categorical or conditional propositions in medi- ate inference. ises in Transcendental Syllogisms: These extend beyond the typical categorical, hypothetical, or disjunctive forms. zal syllo OPOSITIONS: THE BuiLpING BLocks oF Loaic ‘opositions can be thought of as the Lego bricks of logic.

nguage of logic, we consider iny statement as a proposition. _ Aproposition is like a puzzle with four pieces: i. Quantifier: This piece tells us how much or how many of something we're talking about.

Though, the standard order is Subject + Copula + Predicate Types of Propositions Propositions are of two primary types: universal and par- ticular. Universal propositions can be further divided into two groups: 1. Universal Positive or Affirmative (A): These propo- sitions are like saying 'yes' to something. They express inclusion. ¢ Form: They typically follow this pattern: 'All S is P,' where S is the subject, and P is the predicate. e Example: 'All cats are animals.' This means we’re including cats in the big group of animals. ° Distribution: Universal affirmative propositions talk about the subject. For example, in 'All cats are ani- mals,' we're referring to cats, but it doesn’t work the other way around. We can’t say, 'All animals are cats.' Animals 2. Universal Negative (E): These propositions denote exclusion. ¢ Form: 'No S is P.’ e Example: 'No fishes are birds' is a universal negative. e Distribution: Universal negative propositions exclude both the subject and predicate terms.

In the example, no fishes are part of the group of birds. Particular propositions also have two parts: 4. Particular Positive (I): These propositions denote ‘partial inclusion,’ ¢ Form: 'Some S is P.' ¢ Example: 'Some men are foolish.' * Distribution: Neither the subject nor the predi- cate is distributed. In this example, we’re only talking about some men, not all of them, and sim- ilarly, the term 'foolish' is only affirmed for a part of the subject class. === Page 4 === 2. Particular Negative (O): These propositions denote partial exclusion. ¢ Form: 'Some S is not P,' or 'Not every S is P.' e Example: 'Some birds are not carnivores. * Distribution: Only the predicate is distributed. It’s important to note that sometimes the words within a statement may sound negative, but that doesn’t neces- sarily make the whole statement negative. Take a look at these two examples: ‘Shakuni is dishonest.’ 'Telepathy is a non-natural phenomenon. ' These statements are actually considered positive or affir- mative, even though they contain words that might seem negative. So, don’t be fooled by a single word; the overall statement’s ‘feeling’ depends on the structure. However, we'll dive into the idea of quantity in a proposition with more detail. No politicians are liars. politicians are liars. Asyllogistic Arguments: These are more complicated than are represented by A, E, I and O (as prescribed by Aristotelian logic).

In logical reasoning or syllogism problems, the common language sentences may have to be converted into their logical standard form before we can apply logic rules on - them to draw a conclusion. For example, in a previous NET examination, the statements (i) ‘only graduates are eligible for this post’ and (ii) ‘most rickshaw pullers are graduates’ were given. These types of statements need to be converted to their logical form, i.e., quantifier + sub- ject + copula + predicate, as discussed earlier. The rules of reduction can help in solving these types of problems. i.

Title: Understanding Immediate Inference and Propositions

Text:
d’, the proposition is to be treated as particular. The nature of proposition depends upon the context as well. For example, ‘Students are present’ is reduced to, ‘Some students are present’ (I type). In certain cases, the predicates are qualified by words such as ‘hardly’, ‘scarcely’, and ‘seldom’, but quantity is not specified. Such propositions should be treated as par- ticular negative. For example, ‘Businessmen are seldom honest’ is an irregular proposition. It is reduced to, ‘Some businessmen are not honest’. If such a proposition contains the sign of negation, then this proposition is to be treated as an I-type proposition. For example, ‘Businessmen are not seldom honest’ is to be reduced to ‘Some businessmen are honest’, which is an I type proposition. This is so because it involves a double negation, which is equivalent to affirmation. As we discussed earlier, deductive inference problems are basically of two types. 1. Immediate inference 2, Mediate inference IMMEDIATE INFERENCE Here, the ‘conclusion’ is drawn only from ‘one given proposition’ in an argument. It means that there are two propositions in total-one premise and a conclusion. For example, from ‘all men are mortal,' we can immediately deduce that some men are mortal. The immediate infer- ence involves two and only two terms: men and mortal. Now we want to discuss the different techniques for immediate inference. The square of opposition provides a foundational understanding of the relationships between A, E, I, and O and their logical interplay, truth, false etc. Once confident, the learners learn conversion, obversion, and contraposition to manipulate and transform these propositions for the sake of logical equivalence. This is also part of immediate inference. We need to look at diagram 6.1 on page 6.2. Universal mean ‘All’ and ‘No’ are given as subjects in the propositions. Affirmative means === Page 6 === positive, it indicates presence. Negative means ‘No’ and ‘Not’ in the above propositions. Particulars means ‘some’. We have tried to explain the contradictories, contrar- ies, sub contraries and sub alterations. These have been put in the diagram as well.

Summary:
The nature of propositions can vary depending on context, with some propositions being treated as particular and involving techniques such as conversion, obversion, and contraposition for immediate inference.

d ‘Not’ in the above propositions. Particulars means ‘some’. We have tried to explain the contradictories, contrar- ies, sub contraries and sub alterations. These have been put in the diagram as well. A has relationship with E, I and O. E has relationship with A, I and O. So is the case with I and O. Their network makes up the square of opposition. The sqaure of opposition tells us the relationship between quantiaty, quality or both. If we take a horizontal split in the middle across the square of opposition, then A represents Universal Affirmative and E Universal Negative. Below that split, ‘? represents Particular Affirmative and O Particular Negative. Similarly, assume a vertical line Affirmatives and Negative across on left hand and right hand sides. 4. Contradictory Opposition These categorical propositions differ from each other both in quantity and quality. For example, between A type and O type, A is Universal Affirmative and O is Particular Negative. Here, Universal and Particular differ in quantity. Also, Affirmative and Negative dif- fer in Quality. 1. The same is the case with E (Universal Negative) and I (Particular Positive) that again differs in quantity and quality. 2. Two propositions are contradictories if one is denial or negation of the other. They can’t both be true OR both be false. 3. The contradictories exist in two forms ~ 1. A and O 2.EandI E | No men are honest Some men are honest O | Some men are not honest ‘’ in the middle of square of oppostion represents contradictories, with opposite truth values. This can be easily remembered. 2, Contrary Opposition Two universals (A and E) can’t be true together. If A is given to be True, then E is False. If A is given to be false, then O will be doubtful. The vice versa is also applicable. A~ All men are honest. E—-No men are honest. Since God (or Truth) is assumed to be at the top of dia- grams. We assume that God is one, there can’t be two Gods. In a similar manner, both of the contraries (A and E) can’t be true simultaneously. 3. Sub-contrary Opposition Two particulars can’t be true together. If T type is given , to be True, ‘O’ type is doubtful. If 7 is given to be true, Subalternation.

Summary:
The square of opposition explains the relationships between categorical propositions based on quantity and quality, with contradictories having opposite truth values, contraries being unable to both be true, and sub-contraries also being unable to both be true.

Tis False-it means that Some Birds are Mammals is False O is True—Some Birds are Not Mammals is True Thus, as per question A, B and D are part of answer. Thus, (b) is the correct option.

Summary:
If the statement 'some plants are not carnivorous' is false, then 'some plants are carnivorous' is true, 'no plants are carnivorous' is false, and 'all plants are carnivorous' is true, leading to options A, C, and D as the answer; similarly, if the statement 'no birds are mammals' is true, then 'all birds are mammals' is false, 'some birds are mammals' is false, and 'some birds are not mammals' is true, resulting in options A, B, and D as the answer.

We need to know the following basics for understanding of conversion, obversion and contraposition Logical Equivacence Ano MarTeriat EQUIVALENCE Tautology: A tautology is a statement or proposition that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its indi- vidual components. It's like a universal truth, valid in any possible scenario. This means that no matter what specific situation you apply a tautology to, it will always be true. 'A rose is a rose is a rose' by Gertrude Stein is a famous example - a rose is always a rose, no matter how you describe it or what you call it. Other examples are —“The sky is blue or it's not blue’ and ‘If I eat pizza, then I've eaten pizza’. Even light on and light which are linked with a switch is a good example that tells us that truth values come in these two situations.

Summary:
The propositions and relationships between them in logic are used to determine the truth or falsity of statements, with tautologies being statements that are always true regardless of the circumstances.

ue or it's not blue’ and ‘If I eat pizza, then I've eaten pizza’. Even light on and light which are linked with a switch is a good example that tells us that truth values come in these two situations. Material Equivalence: First consider, these two exam- ples, Earth is larger than its satellite Moon’ and ‘New Delhi is the capital of Bharat’. We can’t replace one with other. These statements are materially equivalent. Logical Equivalence: Example Statement A: ‘It is not sunny today.’ Statement B: 'The weather is cloudy today. Now, check their truth values: ° Ifit is sunny today (Statement A is false), State- ment B is also false because it can't be cloudy when it's sunny. ° If it is not sunny today (Statement A is true), Statement B is true because the weather is indeed cloudy when it's not sunny. Both statements have the same truth values - both are true or both are false. The logically equivalent statements convey the same meaning. If we know one of them is true or false, we can be certain that the other has the same truth value. Logically equivalent statements can be sub-' stituted for each other without altering the meaning or truth‘of any argument. Biconditional (If and only if): A biconditional is true only, when the statements on either side of the tribar (symb =, which represents the logical connective) have the sam, _truth value; otherwise it is false. For example: ‘I will atten, the party if and only if my best friend is also going.’ Negation (Not): Anegation is true only when the negate statement is false; otherwise the negation is false. A nega tion has the opposite truth value of the negated state. ment. For example - 'It is not raining’ means the OPposite of 'It is raining.’ ‘ : CONVERSION, OpversION, AND CONTRAPOSITION These rules are used to manipulate categorical Proposi.. tions, making it easier to determine the logical relation. ships between them and derive new propositions based” on given ones.

This means that when you convert an E roposition, either both the original and the converse ,ositions are true or both are false. version by Limitation (Subalternation + Conversion) Jn some cases, a specific type of conversion known as ‘conversion by limitation’ is performed. This involves first changing a universal proposition to a particular one through subalternation and then con- yerting the result. ‘conversion by limitation’ can entail the truth of an 1 proposition with subject and predicate terms reversed. For example, if 'All singers are performers,’ then ‘Some performers are singers.’ However, this works only if there is at least one singer. imitations of Conversion for A and O Propositions Generally speaking, conversion is not reliable for A (Universal Affirmative) and O (Particular Negative) propositions. The quality and truth value may change, and the con- verted proposition may not always accurately repre- sent the original proposition.

Summary:
Converting categorical propositions involves switching the positions of subject and predicate terms, with some memorization required for exams, and while the converse of a proposition is true if the original proposition is true, conversion by limitation can sometimes be used to accurately represent the original proposition.

The quality and truth value may change, and the con- verted proposition may not always accurately repre- sent the original proposition. For instance, ‘All cats are mammals’ can be true, while ‘All mammals are cats’ is false. Similarly, ‘Some - females are not mothers’ can be true, while ‘Some mothers are not females’ is false. ¢ Thus, conversion does not provide a reliable immedi- ate inference with respect to Aand O propositions. je need to know — Convertend (Original proposition), ‘onverse (New proposition) and Conversion (The pro- ss itself). Almost similar terms for Obversion and ontraposition. lasses and Class Compliments efore we take on ‘obverse’ and ‘contraposition’, the ncept of complements is important. The words such birds, mammals, animals, dogs etc have been used by earlier. Every class has a class complement (negative ve)? tribute) associated with it - non-bird, non-mammals, on-animal, non-dog etc. animals.’ For example, if we have a class of ‘birds’, the comple- ent of that class would be 'non-birds' (which includes erything that is not a bird). The ‘double negation’ rule will say ‘non-non-birds' that refers to the class of ‘birds’. Double negation returns to original class. This discussion is important for the obversion and contraposition. Obversion Obversion is a fundamental concept in categorical logic, used to transform a given categorical proposition while Maintaining its truth value. Note that it involves chang- ing the quality (from affirmative to negative or vice versa) and replacing the predicate term with its complement (discussed in earlier paragraphs). The Process of Obversion: Look at the following steps and examples: e To create the obverse of a categorical proposition, reverse the quality and replace the predicate term. ® The subject term remains unchanged. ¢ The quantity of the proposition being obverted also remains the same. Examples of Obversion: ‘All birds are animals' becomes 'No birds are non-animals.' But see the changes: Original Statement: All insects are mammals. Universal Affirmative Insects Mammals Obverted Proposition: No insects are non-mammals.

Summary:
Conversion, obversion, and contraposition are important concepts in categorical logic that involve transforming propositions while maintaining their truth value by changing the quality and replacing the predicate term with its complement.

Contraposition We switch the positions of the subject and predicate terms of a categorical proposition while replacing each term with its complement in this immediate infer- ence. Contrapositions explores the logical relationships between different categorical propositions. Specifically, contraposition can be reduced to the first two terms ~ conversion and obversion. We can take this example to show this: Take the O-type proposition: ‘some farmers are not idealists’. Its logical equivalent is ‘some non-idealists are not non-farmers’. We can this from the above: table also. With I-type, the contraposition is not valid. === Page 10 === Example 1 (A Proposition): Original Proposition: ‘All teachers are intellectuals.’ (eachers), Universal Affirmative Universal Existence (All) Universal Existence (All) Contrapositive: ‘All non-intellectuals are non-teachers.’ Universal Existence (AID) Universal Existence (All) In this example, we switched the subject and predicate terms and replaced them with their complements. The original proposition and its contrapositive have the same truth-value. Universal Affirmative.

Summary:
Obversion involves replacing the predicate term with its complement while keeping the subject term and quantity unchanged, and contraposition involves switching the positions of the subject and predicate terms while replacing each term with its complement, with both being valid immediate inferences for categorical propositions.

Universal Existence (Some) Negative Universal Existence (Some) Particular In this example, we first perform subalternation (changing a universal to a particular proposition), then switch the subject and predicate terms and replace them with their complements. Contraposition by limitation works for E proposi- tions, and the original E proposition entails the truth of the related O proposition. : Limitations of Contraposition for E and I Propositions: In general, contraposition is not a valid immediate inference for E (Universal Negative) and I (Particular Affirmative) propositions. Example 1 (E Proposition): 'No trees are birds' and 'No non-birds are non-trees' may not have the same truth-value. Example 2 (I Proposition): 'Some lions are carnivores' and 'Some non-carnivores are not non-lions' may not have the: same truth-value. Contraposition does not reliably hold for E and I propositions.

StepIV Check for complementary pair if steps II and. Ill fail. The requirement of steps I, III, and IV depends upon the question. Step I: Alignment of the Propositions — It consists of two steps. Firstly, make sure that there are exactly three terms given in both the statements. In case, the number of terms is different, we need not go fur- ther, as there will be no conclusion. Secondly, we check whether the propositions are in standard form or not. For practical purposes, the following format can be used as a standard. A, B, and C used above denote the first, second, and third term, just for quick representation of terms while solving practical questions. Please note that this A (used for first term) is different from A used for universal affirmative. As discussed earlier, in the conclusion statement, the first term (subject) is the subject of the first proposition and second term (predicate) is the predicate of the second proposition. This fact becomes the basis for the alignment of propositions. In case, the problem is in the standard form, we can directly move to Step I. If one or both propositions are not given in the stan- dard format, align them by 1. Converting the first or second statement or both 2. Changing the order of premises We can make it clear through the following examples. It is important to remind at this stage that sometimes the words ‘mostly’, ‘generally’, ‘only’, and so on are mentioned in one or both the statements. Initially, we convert them into logical form before doing their alignment, if required, has been discussed separately under ‘Converting commg language statements into their logical Form’ on Page 6,9.

For example, if there are two statements, A-type and I-type, which | should be converted so that our purpose of getting the standard form is achieved? The IEA rule helps - jn such decision-making. If first statement given is of A-type and second is of I-type, then as per IEA rule, the I-type statement ‘should be given priority for conversion. Similarly, in case of confusion between E-type and A-type, E-type should be given priority over A-type. No conclusion as I +I =No conclusion. Now, consider some examples from NET previous years’ exams. In each of the following questions (1-3), two statements are followed by two conclusions, A and B. Assuming that the given statements are true even if they are at variance with commonly known facts, pick up one of the following answer choices which you think is correct. (a) If only conclusion A follows. (b) If only conclusion B follows. (c) If both A and B follows. (d) If neither A nor B follows.

In general, we can say that two egatives (E+E, E+0O,O+E, or O+0) do not lead to any onclusion. Two particulars also do not lead to any conclusion. Solution: No conclusion can be drawn from the two par- ticular affirmative propositions. So (A) does not follow. | Second conclusion is the converse of the first statement, so (B) follows. Hence, (B) is the answer.

Summary:
The IEA rule helps determine which type of statement should be given priority for conversion in syllogism problems, with examples provided from previous NET exams.

Some men are not crows. 2. All crows are birds. === Page 14 === Solution: Consider the following steps. Step I: The middle term is birds. A close observation indi- cates that the statements are in the form B to C and AtoB. After swapping, the statements will become ‘All crows are birds’ and ‘All birds are men’. Step Ii: The conclusion should be A + A = A (universal positive). The conclusion is ‘Ail crows are men’. So (d) is the answer. Example 3 Statements 1. All boats are boys. 2. All boys are larnps. Conclusions A. All lamps are boats. B. All boats are lamps. Solution: Consider the following steps. Step I; Statements are in the standard form, A to B and B to C. The common term, boys, is the predicate of the first proposition and the subject of the second proposition. So no alignment is required. StepIk A+A=A The subject of the conclusion will be the subject of the first statement, and the predicate of the conclusion will be the predicate of the second statement. The common terms will disappear. So, the conclusion is ‘All boats are lamps’. Thus, only conclusion 2 follows and (B) is the answer. Now solving the problem through Venn diagram solution. According to Statement I, ‘All boats are boys’, Figure 6.4 According to Statement I and Statement II, the Venn dia- gram looks as follows: Figure 6.5 Looking at the Venn diagram, we can say that second con- clusion, ‘All boats are lamps’ is correct. Example 4 Statements 1. All lemons are balls. 2. No bats are lemons.

Summary:
The conclusion drawn is that the second statement follows, as it is the converse of the first statement, making (B) the answer.

These are | continuity with the earlier discussion. Every deduction should contain exactly three terms. The middle term (present in both the premises) must be distributed at least once. if one of the premises is negative, then the con- clusion must be negative (will have the words ‘no’ or ‘not’). {f one of the premises is particular, then the con- clusion must be particular (will have the words ‘some’, ‘few’, ‘many’, etc.). If both the premises are particular, then no con- _.. clusion can be drawn from the given premises. 6. If both the premises are negative, then no conclu- sion can be drawn from the given premises. 7, A term that is not distributed in the premises cannot be distributed in the conclusion. mples of Mediate and Immediate Inference All movies are stories. All stories are surprises. clusions All movies are surprises. Some surprises are movies. ution: First, let us consider only the statements. The ntences are already aligned. Since A+ A=A, the conclusion will be ‘All movies are sut- ‘ises’. Till this point, it is a question of mediate inference. If we convert this conclusion (immediate inference), e get, ‘Some surprises are movies’. Hence, both the con- usions given in the question are true. IN fail. atement: ample 2 diements » Some rooms are lamps. » Some lamps are tubes. ences are nelusions - Some rooms are tubes. - Some lamps are rooms. Solution: We know that from a combination of I + I, no mclusion can be drawn. On converting the first statement, we get ‘Some lamps € rooms’, i.e., conclusion (B). Also, on converting the second statement, we get nelusions Some tubes are lamps’. This proposition is not given in the conclusion part. So, in this example, conclusion (B) alone is true.

Summary:
Some golden rules have emerged to solve syllogism problems, including the requirement for every deduction to contain three terms and for the middle term to be distributed at least once, with specific rules for negative and particular premises leading to corresponding conclusions.

This is logically equivalent to the proposition ‘Some logicians are attorneys. 8. Ifthe statement 'no animals are fishes' is given as false, then it means that some animals are fishes. Therefore, only statement D can be immediately inferred to be true. The other statements are not necessarily true. For example, statement A (All fishes are animals) is not necessarily true because some fishes may not be animals (e.g., dolphins). Statement C (All animals are fishes) is definitely false because we know that there are animals that are not fishes (e.g., cats, dogs, humans). Therefore, the only statement that can be immediately inferred to be true is statement D (Some animals are fishes). 2. Comprehensive Description: Moods provide a con. 6.

Total Moods: There are four types of categorica propositions (A, E, I, O), and there are three positions (major, minor, and conclusion) in a categorical syllo- gism. Each position can have one of these categorical propositions. So, the total number of possible moods in traditional categorical syllogistic logic is indeed 4 x 4.x 4, which equals to 64, which is mathemati- cally accurate. But practically only a subset of these is considered valid moods as they produce sound arguments. There are only four accepted moods (AAI, AEO, EAE, EAO) as truly valid syllogistic forms. There are different theories, one of them says that there are 15 valid moods out of total 256. Few Examples: All humans are mortal. Socrates is human.

Major Premise (Universal Negative): No reptiles are mammals. ¢ Minor Premise (Particular Affirmative): Some bats are mammals. * Conclusion (Particular Negative): Therefore, some bats are not reptiles. IGURE he figure in a categorical syllogism refers to the place- ment of the middle term in the two premises. Figures help categorize syllogisms based on their structure, enabling a structured approach to evaluating their validity. The main features of ‘figures’ are as follows: 1. Arrangement of Terms determines the Figures: This aspect is very important. Figures tells us how the three terms, Major, Middle and Minor (respectively rep- resented by M, P, and S) are distributed between the major premise and the minor premise. The four stan- dard figures are Barbara, Celarent, Darii, and Ferio. Specific Distribution of the Middle Term: Depending on the figure, the middle term can be the subject of the major premise, the predicate of the major premise, or both. This distribution influences the logical structure of the syllogism. 3. Validity Rules: Each figure has its own set of valid- ity rules or patterns. Understanding the rules for each figure is crucial for evaluating the validity of syllogisms. 4. Mood and Figure: The combination of the figure and the specific mood (the categorical statements used in the premises, such as 'All M are P' or 'No S are M’) uniquely identifies a syllogism. In traditional categorical syllogism, a 'figure' refers to the arrangement of the middle term (M), major term (P), and minor term (S) in the two premises of a syllogism. These four figures represent the possible arrangements of terms in categorical syllogisms. The names Barbara, Celarent, Darii, and Ferio are traditional mnemonics to help remember these figures. 1* Figure (Mood - Barbara): In this figure, the mid- dle term (M) is the subject of the major premise and the predicate of the minor premise. The standard form is as follows: Major Premise: All M are P. Minor Premise: All S are M. 24 Figure (Mood - Celarent): In this figure, the middle term (M) is the subject of both premises. The standard form is as follows: Major Premise: No M are P. Minor Premise: All S are M.

Summary:
In a categorical syllogism, the figure refers to the arrangement of the middle term in the premises, with four standard figures (Barbara, Celarent, Darii, and Ferio) each having its own validity rules and patterns based on the distribution of the middle term.

Minor Premise: All S are M. 34 Figure (Mood - Darii): In this figure, the middle term (M) is the predicate of both premises. The standard form: Major Premise: All M are P. Minor Premise: Some S are M. 4th Figure (Mood - Ferio): In this figure, the middle term (M) is the predicate of the major premise and the subject of the minor premise. Major Premise: No M are P. Minor Premise: Some S are M. The arrangement can be understood with the help of fol- lowing ‘collar type diagrams’ also. There is no role of ‘conclusion’, and obviously that of sub- ject and predicate as well. Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 M Pe P W@W @M P P W s Ms M® WM s WM s Ss P S P S P By P Figure 1 We can draw lines through the middle terms in each of these four diagrams to create a collar-like shape, like this: === Page 18 === Figure 1 Figure P Pp @ The specific arrangement of terms in the premises is essen- tial because it determines whether a syllogism is valid or invalid. The figure, along with the mood (the specific cat- egorical statements used in the premises, such as 'All M are P' or 'No Mare P’), is used to evaluate the validity of the syl- logism based on established rules of categorical syllogisms. For example, if you have a syllogism in the first figure and use the mood 'Barbara,' it means you have premises struc- tured as described for the first figure and mood Barbara. The validity of the syllogism is then assessed based on these rules. The specific arrangement and mood of the syllogism are crucial in traditional syllogistic logic, and these fac- tors are not related to any physical shapes but rather to the logical structure of the argument. An Example of Moods and Figures: All cats are mammals. All. mammals are pets. Therefore, all ats are pet. All cats are mammals. Some mammals are pets. Therefore, some cats are pets. No dogs are mammals. All - mammals are animals. Therefore, no dogs are animals “AEE IV All cats are mammals. No mammals are birds. Therefore, no cats are birds.

Summary:
The arrangement and mood of terms in categorical syllogisms determine their validity based on established rules of logic.

e premises. It’s a failure the structure of the argument. ey are characterized by invalid deductive arguments, aning that the premises do not support the conclusion. Example: 'All rats are black bugs. All black bugs are nivores. Therefore, all rats are black bugs.' This argu- nent is invalid because the premises do not logically lead the conclusion. _ Logical relationships deal with the structure of ‘argu- nents and reasoning’, while grammar deals with the structure of language’. _ Formal fallacies are errors in reasoning that occur due 0 flaws in the structure or form of an argument. These Ypes of fallacies are characterized by invalid deductive €asoning, where the conclusion does not logically follow tom the premises. There are several main types of formal allacies: ns. enying the Antecedent (Modus Tollens Fallacy): odus Tollens is a valid form of deductive reasoning that Sserts if a conditional statement implies a consequence, nd that consequence is false, then the antecedent (the hitial condition) must also be false. 1. If statement A is true, then statement B is true. 2. Statement A is not true. From these premises, someone incorrectly concludes: _ 3. Statement B is not true. The concrete example is given as under: Premise 1: If it’s raining (A), then the ground is wet (B). Premise 2: It’s not raining (A is not true). Incorrect Conclusion: Therefore, the ground must be dry (B is not true). This argument is fallacious because it wrongly assumes that ifit’s not raining (A is not true), then the ground must. be dry (B is not true). However, there could be other rea- sons (e.g., someone watering the ground) for the ground to be wet even when it’s not raining. The fallacy lies in the incorrect leap from the negation of A to the negation of B. Affirming the Consequent (Modus Ponens Fallacy): Modus Ponens is a valid form of deductive reasoning used in logic. It follows this structure: 1. If statement A is true, then statement B is true. 2. Statement B is true. From these premises, we can conclude: 3. Statement A is true. We can take a more concrete example here: Premise 1: If it rains (A), then the ground gets wet (B). Premise 2: It’s raining (B is true).

Summary:
Formal fallacies are errors in reasoning that occur due to flaws in the structure or form of an argument, such as denying the antecedent or affirming the consequent in deductive reasoning.

. From these premises, we can conclude: 3. Statement A is true. We can take a more concrete example here: Premise 1: If it rains (A), then the ground gets wet (B). Premise 2: It’s raining (B is true). Conclusion: The ground is wet (A is true). So, if it’s raining (B is true), then we can logically infer that the ground is wet (A is true) based on the initial conditional statement. This is the Modus Ponens form of reasoning. Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle: This fallacy occurs when a shared characteristic is used to draw a conclusion, but this characteristic is not distributed (present) in all the members of the groups being compared. Example: 'All birds have wings. Bats have wings. Therefore, bats are birds.' This argument is invalid because not all winged creatures are birds. Fallacy of the Illicit Process (Illicit Major and Minor): This type of fallacy happens when there is an improper or invalid shift of terms between the premises and the con- clusion in a syllogism. Example (Illicit Major): 'All dogs are mammals. Fido is a mammal. Therefore, Fido is a dog.' This argument is inva- lid because the major term (‘mammal’) is shifted improp- erly from the premise to the conclusion. Example (Illicit Minor): 'All cats have tails. Fluffy is a cat. Therefore, Fluffy has a tail.' This argument is invalid because the minor term (‘Fluffy’) is shifted improperly from the premise to the conclusion. Fallacy of the Exclusive Premises: This fallacy occurs when both premises in a syllogism are negative. In this case, no conclusion can be drawn. === Page 20 === Example: 'No birds are reptiles. No reptiles can fly. Therefore, no birds can fly.' This argument is invalid because no conclusion can be drawn when both premises are negative. Existential Fallacy: This fallacy arises when a particular conclusion is wrongly drawn from a universal premise. It assumes that something exists when it’s not guaranteed by the premises. Example: 'All students in the class are intelligent. Jane is a student. Therefore, Jane is intelligent.’ This argument is invalid because the premise doesn’t guarantee that every student in the class is intelligent.

Summary:
Modus Ponens is a valid form of reasoning where if a conditional statement is true and its consequent is true, then the antecedent must also be true, while fallacies such as the Undistributed Middle, Illicit Process, Exclusive Premises, and Existential Fallacy involve errors in logic that lead to invalid conclusions.

Title: Understanding Informal Fallacies

Text:
tudents in the class are intelligent. Jane is a student. Therefore, Jane is intelligent.’ This argument is invalid because the premise doesn’t guarantee that every student in the class is intelligent. INFORMAL FALLACIES Informal fallacies are more dependent on the misuse of language and evidence, and they often involve errors in reasoning. They can take many forms and are more com- mon in everyday life. Informal fallacies occur when the relationship between premises and conclusions is flawed or when premises are unsound. There is use of Latin words in many of informal fallacies. The following are crucial in understanding and identi- fying informal fallacies. 1. Ethos relates to the credibility of the speaker 2. Logos to the logical soundness of the argument, and 3. Pathos to the emotional appeal used within the argu- ment. The various fallacies are as follows: 1. Ad Hominem (Attacking Arguer Instead of Argu- ment-getting abusive) This fallacy occurs when an argument attacks the character, motives, or other attributes of the person making the argument, rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself. The excess of this can lead to 'poisoning the well’. Argument against the person Verbally A, = Arguer 1 A, = Arguer 2 (A, commits the Argument fallacy) Examples: e Person A: 'We should invest more in healthcare to improve the system. ¢ Person B: 'Person A is known to have a gambling problem, so their opinion doesn’t matter.’ 2. Petitio Principii (Begging the Question): This fal- lacy occurs when the argument’s premises themselves contain the conclusion in some form, and no further evidence or reasoning is provided to support the con- clusion independently. It essentially argues that some- thing is proven by itself, creating a circular reasoning pattern. Here, no ‘extra explanation’ is required in the argument that is hidden within the statement. This fallacy is sometimes called an immediate argum. Begging the question : 1. 2. 3. Shaky Premise Shaky Premise Conclusion Conclusion Conclusion Premise Shaky key Premise (missing) Conclusion (restates premise) Conclusion _ For example: 1. Premise 1: 'Murder is morally wrong.' 2. Premise 2: ‘Abortion is murder.’ 3.

Summary:
The argument that "Jane is intelligent because she is a student in a class of intelligent students" is invalid due to the lack of guarantee that all students in the class are intelligent, and informal fallacies such as ad hominem attacks and begging the question can occur when the relationship between premises and conclusions is flawed or when premises are unsound.

Text:
lusion Conclusion Conclusion Premise Shaky key Premise (missing) Conclusion (restates premise) Conclusion _ For example: 1. Premise 1: 'Murder is morally wrong.' 2. Premise 2: ‘Abortion is murder.’ 3. Conclusion: Therefore, abortion is morally wrong:' We may agree with the first premise that murder is mor. ally wrong, the issue lies in the second premise. Not everyone would accept that abortion is equivalent to murder. However, in this presentation, the second prem- ise presumes its validity without adequate support. 3. Hasty Generalization or Sample Size Fallacy: This fal lacy involves drawing a broad conclusion about a whole group or situation (generalization) based on a limited or insufficient sample, without adequate evidence.This is also known as the fallacy of insufficient statistics. Hasty generalization Specific case(s) (not representative) Generalization General rule Example: If someone meets a few rude people froma __ particular city and concludes that everyone from that _ city is rude, it’s a hasty generalization. : 4. Fallacy of Sweeping Generalization (Accident) This fallacy involves making overly broad statements _ or conclusions about a specific situation or group. without considering relevant differences, which can. lead to discrimination and prejudice. General rule ———— Misapplied Example: We may say that all politicians are corrupt, or all lawyers are greedy, but we forget that there may be good or bad of everything. Accident === Page 21 === ise 1: ‘Murderers are to be hanged' (normal umstance). ; mise 2: ‘So, all soldiers must be hanged' (special umstance). fallacy may lead to discrimination and preju- d decisions. onverse Fallacy of Accident: This fallacy occurs nen we wrongly apply a rule or idea meant for a spe- fic situation to all situations, even when they’re dif- rent. It’s like using a rule in a way that doesn’t fit the yrent circumstance. ‘ample: Imagine a debate between Socrates and jemarchus about justice. Polemarchus says justice about repaying debts. Socrates challenges this idea _asking if justice also means giving back weapons u borrowed from a-friend when you know your end’s mind isn’t clear.

Socrates challenges this idea _asking if justice also means giving back weapons u borrowed from a-friend when you know your end’s mind isn’t clear. If the answer is ‘yes,’ it shows e ‘fallacy of direct accident.' gument ad Populum (Bandwagon Fallacy): This fallacy occurs when a speech or argument tries to influ- ence the audience’s emotions, often by evoking strong feelings like love or hatred, without relying on strong logical or evidential support. It’s like swaying people’s opinions based on emotions rather than facts. ‘Appeal to the people Plays on need for security, etc. A = Arguer “RIL = Reader/ Listener Conclusion Example: In Shakespeare’s ‘Julius Caesar,’ Mark ization” Antony stirs up the crowd to seek revenge for Caesar’s : assassination, appealing to their emotions. Similar emotional appeals can be seen in political speeches. For instance, the Agniveer Scheme led to violence, ple fro while a similar scheme in Israel gained public accep- ; _tance. This type of fallacy can occur in various con- _ texts, including modern-day issues. _ The 'Bandwagon Fallacy' is a metaphor for people joining a popular trend, movement, or opinion with- _ Out proper reasoning. Argument ad Verecundiam (Appeal to Authority): This fallacy occurs when someone tries to support their argument by referring to an authority figure or expert, even if that authority's expertise isn’t relevant to the argument. Appeal to unqualified authority A = Arguer Au = Unqualified authority Conclusion Example: It is often seen in advertising campaigns fea- turing well-known celebrities like Amitabh Bachchan or Shahrukh Khan endorsing products, services, or e corrup there ma causes. If Shahrukh Khan endorses a brand of smart- phones, it doesn’t make him a smartphone expert. In simpler terms, it’s when an argument relies on someone famous to support it, even if that person’s expertise doesn’t match the topic. 8. Argument ad Misericordiam (Argument from Pity or Emotions): This fallacy occurs when someone attempts to win an argument or gain sympathy by making others feel sorry for them, even if the emo- tional appeal is unrelated to the issue at hand.

Summary:
Polemarchus believes justice is about repaying debts, but Socrates challenges this idea by questioning if justice also means returning borrowed weapons when one's intentions are unclear, highlighting the fallacy of appealing to emotions rather than logic in arguments.

Title: Logical Fallacies: Pity, Slippery Slope, and Red Herring

Text:
Pity or Emotions): This fallacy occurs when someone attempts to win an argument or gain sympathy by making others feel sorry for them, even if the emo- tional appeal is unrelated to the issue at hand. Appeal to pity Evokes A = Arguer R/L = Reader/ Listener Example: Imagine a student who didn’t study for an exam. When confronted by the teacher, they might say, 'I know I failed, but my cat was sick, and I was up all night taking care of it. Can you please give me another chance?' This student is appealing to the teacher’s pity by mentioning their sick cat, even if it had nothing to do with their failure to study. 9. Slippery Slope: This fallacy involves assuming that one action will lead to a series of negative conse- quences, ultimately leading to an undesirable out- come in the future, often without considering inter- mediate events. We may step on a slippery slope for fun but end result may be accidental. Slippery slope Chain reaction (not likely to occur) Example 1: Allowing people to drive under the influ- ence of alcohol at a low level will inevitably lead to more drunk driving accidents, more deaths, and a breakdown of society. Example 2: If sex education is introduced in college, it’s argued that students will become sexually active, resulting in a surge of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. This, in turn, will force students to drop out of college, depriving them of the opportunity to succeed in life. In reality, learning about sex does not automatically lead to sexual activ- ity, and it’s unlikely that mere sex education will com- pel students to drop out. 10. Red Herring (Irrelevant Thesis): This fallacy occurs when an unrelated or off-topic subject is introduced into an argument to divert the audience’s attention from the original issue. === Page 22 === 11. 12. Red herring A = Arguer R/L = Reader/ Listener “Conclusion Example: When a teacher catches a student cheating during an exam, the student might respond by saying, I acknowledge my mistake, but please consider my parents.

Summary:
Appeal to pity fallacy involves trying to win an argument by evoking sympathy, while slippery slope fallacy assumes one action will lead to a series of negative consequences, and red herring fallacy introduces an unrelated topic to divert attention from the original issue.

uer R/L = Reader/ Listener “Conclusion Example: When a teacher catches a student cheating during an exam, the student might respond by saying, I acknowledge my mistake, but please consider my parents. It would be shocking to them." In this case, the student employs a red herring by appealing to the teacher’s emotions, attempting to shift focus away from the real issue of cheating. Strawman Argument: This involves misrepresent- ing or distorting an opponent’s argument to make it appear weaker or more flawed than it actually is. The main objective is to attack the weak and defeat that. Straw man Distorts A = Arguer Op = Opponent’s position Conclusion Example 1: 'The MP believes that driving a Hybrid car will miraculously solve all our ecological problems.' Example 2: 'On the contrary, the MP actually believes that the environment is in such a dire state that indi- vidual car choices and driving habits wouldn’t make the slightest difference.’ In both cases, the opponents mischaracterize the MP’s true position, making it eas- ier to knock down the misrepresented argument. Ignoratio Elenchi (Missing the Point): This fallacy occurs when the argument deviates from the main topic or original intention, often due to misrepresen- tation, introducing irrelevant information, or draw- ing illogical conclusions. Missing the point Actually entails Premises P Conclusion ‘A’ Conclusion ‘B’ Example: Imagine a discussion about missing the bus but ending up with a story about the bus missing its route. This fallacy is essentially a case of reasoning going ‘astray. Plurium Interrogationum (Complex Question or. Loaded Question): This fallacy is frequently encoun- tered in the legal field and is a deceptive form of manipulation, often aimed at trapping the accused or opponents. It involves crafting a question in such a way that it offers only two possible answers, bo of which lead to a disadvantageous outcome for th respondent. The trap is concealed within the que _tion, making it extremely challenging for anyone to provide an alternative response. Complex question Attempts to trap | by asking question A = Arguer Oo?

For example: Person A: 'You better agree with my opinion, or else I'll make sure you lose your job.' Person B: 'Okay, okay, I agree with your opinion.’ Fallacies Due to Ambiguity ° Ambiguity can lead to fallacies when words or sen- tence structures are unclear or can be interpreted in _ different ways. e The main types are as follows: 1. Equivocation (Ambiguous Words): This occurs. when a word or phrase has’ multiple meanings or senses, and these different meanings are used interchangeably within an argument or state- ment.

The sentence structure is ambiguous, and it’s unclear whether the love is directed more toward her son than her dog or whether her son is loved more than her dog is loved. 3. Differing Accent (Emphasizing Different Aspects): Differing accent ambiguity occurs when a statement or argument can be interpreted differently based on the emphasis or accent placed on different words or aspects of the state- ment. This type of ambiguity can be related to spoken language, where changes in emphasis can change the meaning. Example: ‘I didn’t say you should clean the kitchen.’ Depending on where the emphasis is placed, this sentence can be interpreted as deny- ing that any instruction was given or emphasizing the action of cleaning rather than something else. neanin are ee NDUCTIVE FALLACIES or state We know that inductive reasoning involves making gener- differen! alizations or drawing conclusions based on specific obser- y happe Vations or evidence. ‘False cause fallacy’ happens when we nents t are creating generalization on the basis of false causes or Say when there is no existence of such causal relationship. Example: 'Every time I wear my lucky hat, my favourite IPL cricket team wins. Therefore, my lucky hat causes my team to win.’ ‘Occurrence in Historical or Causal Claims: Inductive fal- lacies, including the 'False Cause’ fallacy, often appear in his- torical or causal claims. People naturally seek explanations for events and phenomena. Historians may claim that Indus Valley or Mesopotamian Civilization declined due supernat- ural causes such as earthquakes, droughts, or other natural phenomena, which may not necessarily be the actual causes.

Summary:
Ambiguity in sentence structure can lead to different interpretations, while differing accent ambiguity occurs when emphasis on different words can change the meaning of a statement, and inductive fallacies like the 'False Cause' fallacy can result in incorrect generalizations or causal claims.

(a) Red herring (b) Slippery slope (c) Strawman (d) Appeal to an authority Ans. 1.(a) 2.(a) 3.(c) 4.(c) 5.(a) 6.(b) Explanation: In the term ‘Denying the Consequent,' the word 'deny- ing' implies the rejection or negation of the conse- quent, which is the second part or the conclusion of a conditional statement in a logical argument. 2. Modus Tollens involves denying the consequent, where the denial of the conclusion leads to the nega- _tion of the antecedent in a conditional statement. Though the question statement seems to be oversim- plified, it seems that distorts one’s thinking itself, and unconscious resistance are the result of that criticism of oedipal complex. This becomes a case of circular reasoning argument. There is no provision of inde- pendent or valid support for this assumption. Thus, the answer is ‘begging the question’, The question statement combines multiple assump- tions within a single question, making it difficult to answer without accepting those assumptions. Ad Populum is the correct answer. This is also known as the bandwagon fallacy. In this case, the speaker is trying to persuade someone to attend the party by suggesting that everyone else is going. 6. The informal fallacy committed in this argument is the slippery slope. A slippery slope argument is one that claims that a small first step will inevitably lead to a chain of related events culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect. In this case, the argument is that staying out late, not calling home, and going to wild parties will inevitably lead to a life that is completely out -of control. When it comes to understanding the structure of argu- ments, there are various key elements and perspectives to consider. These elements provide insights into the relationships and characteristics of arguments, which are essential for sound reasoning and critical thinking. Let us explore some of these aspects: RELATIONAL ARGUMENTS Relational arguments are a crucial component of the structure of arguments.

s, which are essential for sound reasoning and critical thinking. Let us explore some of these aspects: RELATIONAL ARGUMENTS Relational arguments are a crucial component of the structure of arguments. In these types of arguments, both the premises and their conclusions are based on relational propositions. These arguments often revolve around two main characteristics: the relation of something to itse and the relation of something to others. In the context o¢ competitive exams like NET, questions about relationa) arguments are common. Let’s delve into some fundamen. tal concepts within this domain: Symmetry 1. Symmetrical Relationship: Symmetry is a concept where the relationship between two elements works. both ways. For example, if 'A is equal to B,’ it is algg_ true that 'B is equal to A.' This is a valid and 'symmetrj.. cal relationship.’ 2. Asymmetrical Relationship: In contrast, an asym- metrical relationship doesn’t work both ways. If 'A is greater than B,' it does not imply that 'B is greater than A." This is an ‘invalid’ relationship. 3. Non-Symmetrical Relationship: Some relationships may or may not work both ways. For instance, if 'A is’ the sister of B,' it’s not necessarily true that 'B is the sister of A.' B could be the brother of A. Whether it’s valid or not depends on additional information. Transitivity 1. Transitive Relation: A transitive relation implies that a relationship travels from A to C through B. For. example, if 'A is equal to B' and 'B is equal to CG,’ it is valid to conclude that 'A is equal to C.' This type of relationship often holds true in various scenarios, For instance, 'younger to,' ‘precedes,' 'succeeds,' and ‘ancestor of are other examples of transitive relation- ships. Intransitive Relation: In an intransitive relation, the relationship does not travel from A to C through B. For. example, if 'A is the father of B' and 'B is the father of C,' it’s not valid to conclude that 'A is the father of C. In such cases, the conclusion is false. Relations such as 'son of fall into this category. 3. Non-Transitive Relation: In non-transitive relations, the connection between elements is not straight- forward.

Summary:
Relational arguments, including concepts like symmetry and transitivity, are essential for sound reasoning and critical thinking, particularly in competitive exams like NET.

ch cases, the conclusion is false. Relations such as 'son of fall into this category. 3. Non-Transitive Relation: In non-transitive relations, the connection between elements is not straight- forward. For instance, if 'A is an enemy of B' and 'B- is an enemy of C,' it’s not necessarily true that 'A is an enemy of C.' Whether this is valid or not depends on the specific context. Relations like ‘friend of and ‘neighbour of often fall into this category. Understanding these aspects of the structure of argu- ments, including relational arguments, symmetry, and transitivity, is essential for sound deductive reasoning and for answering questions related to these topics in exams like NET. Let’s explore an example to illustrate these concepts: Example: In the expression, 'Nothing is larger than itself,’ the relation ‘is larger than’ is: (a) Antisymmetric (b) Asymmetric (c) Intransitive (d) Irreflexive === Page 25 === is example tests your understanding of relational ments and the characteristics of the 'is larger than' onship.

Understanding these iples is not only beneficial for exams but also for roving critical thinking and reasoning skills. xiveness exiveness is a concept that describes the nature of tionships between different terms. There are several 5 of reflexiveness that can help us understand these tionships: Reflexive relationship: This type of relationship ‘occurs when a term is related to itself. It’s like say- ing something is equal to itself, resembles itself, or is as old as it is young. For example, when we say, 'A is equal to A,' this is a reflexive relationship. Partial Reflexiveness: This occurs when a term establishes a relationship with something else. For instance, if 'A is as tall as B, and B is as tall as C,' it logically follows that 'A is as tall as C.' This concept involves more than just self-relationships. Irreflexive: Irreflexive relationships are the opposite of reflexive ones. In these relationships, a term cannot relate to itself.

Understanding the concepts of symmetry, transitivity, and reflexivity in relationships is essential for sound deductive reasoning and answering related questions in exams like NET.

tall as C.' This concept involves more than just self-relationships. Irreflexive: Irreflexive relationships are the opposite of reflexive ones. In these relationships, a term cannot relate to itself. For example, saying 'A is smaller than itself or 'A is west of itself doesn’t make sense. These _ are examples of irreflexive relationships. Non-reflexive: Non-reflexive relationships may or may not involve a term relating to itself. For instance, ‘A loves itself is a non-reflexive concept because it may or may not happen. It depends on the specific context and circumstances. onnexity is another type of relationship, but this one is lid between any two terms. For example, when we say is greater than 2 and less than 4,' this demonstrates mnexity. Connexity helps us understand how different rms relate to each other and can be valuable in various ntexts. ¥pes of Definitions Definitions are essential for understanding concepts and tms in a clear and comprehensive manner. There are dif- try, and ferent types of definitions that serve various purposes: ning and n exams. Intensional Definition: This type of definition speci- fies the properties or features and the meaning of a term. For instance, in chemistry, water is defined as a compound of hydrogen and oxygen, while in physics, it is defined as a liquid with a freezing point of 0°C and a boiling point of 100°C. - Extensional Definition: Extensional definitions spec- ify the class members of a term. For example, when we define the planets of the solar system as Mercury, an itself,’ - 6.33 Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, we are using an extensional definition. 3. Lexical Definition: Also known as a reportive defini- tion, a lexical definition is the dictionary meaning of a term, which is the common vocabulary of a given language. It helps us understand the basic meanings of words like 'book' or 'chair.' 4. Stipulative Definition: Stipulative definitions are arbi- trary and are used to assign new meanings to terms, even if they already have existing meanings. Idioms and slangs in language are examples of stipulative definitions. 5.

Summary:
Various types of relationships, including reflexive, irreflexive, and non-reflexive, as well as different types of definitions such as intensional, extensional, lexical, and stipulative, are important for understanding concepts and terms in a clear and comprehensive manner.

Title: Types of Definitions and Connotations

Text:
ulative definitions are arbi- trary and are used to assign new meanings to terms, even if they already have existing meanings. Idioms and slangs in language are examples of stipulative definitions. 5. Precising Definition: Precising definitions are devel- oped to clarify vague or ambiguous terms, often in fields like law, science, or medicine. For example, defining a virus as an infectious agent that causes smallpox is a precising definition. 6. Persuasive Definition: A persuasive definition attaches an emotive, positive, or derogatory meaning to a term that may not inherently have such connota- tions. It is often used as a rhetorical tool in debates or discussions to influence opinions. 7. Operational Definition: Operational definitions pro- ‘ vide meaning to a term by specifying a measurement procedure. They are commonly used in scientific and technical contexts. 8. Functional Definition: Functional definitions specify the purpose or use of the items denoted by the term. They explain how something functions or what role it serves. 9. Ostensive Definition: This type of definition is devel- oped by showing someone an object and attaching a word to it. It is often used when a term is challenging to define verbally, especially for new speakers or in contexts like colors or sensations. 10. Analogous Definition: Analogous definitions rely on analogy and correspondence between two different terms. For example, comparing a brain to a computer in some particular function or feature is an analogous definition. Connotative and Denotative Meanings Words often have multiple meanings, categorized as © denotative or connotative: 1. Denotation: Denotation is the explicit, dictionary definition of a word. For example, the denotation of ‘home' is 'a place where one lives; a residence.' 2. Connotation: Connotation goes beyond the diction- ary definition. It includes the emotions, associations, or ideas that a word evokes. For instance, ‘home’ con- notes a sense of security, comfort, and family.

Summary:
Different types of definitions, such as stipulative, precising, persuasive, operational, functional, ostensive, and analogous, are used to assign meanings to terms in various contexts, while words can have denotative or connotative meanings.

To tackle these questions, you'll use methods like inductive reasoning, deductive reason- ing, quoting authorities, facts, findings, and illustrations. Approach 1. Underline important assumptions. 2. Identify supporting arguments. 3. Note the premises of supporting arguments. 4. Pay attention to the nature of questions. Types of Questions 1. Assumptions and Statements: * Assumptions are implied by the associated theory or argument. e They can be hidden or explicit. ° Questions may ask which assumption is implicit in a statement. * You'll choose from options like ‘Only assumption I is implicit! or ‘Neither I nor II is implicit.' Example 1 Statement: A advises B to undergo training for career success, Assumptions: I. B sought advice from A. Il. Experts are more competent. * Explanation: I might not always be true, but II is- implied since A recommended training from an expert. Force of Arguments ¢ Anargumentis aset of premises leading to aconclusion. ¢ Arguments are valid if the premises, if true, definitely lead to a conclusion. Assertion and Reasoning e These questions have one assertion (A) and one rea- son (R).

Summary:
Connotation goes beyond dictionary definitions, including emotions and associations, while understanding facts, opinions, beliefs, and prejudice is important for critically evaluating statements and arguments in analytical reasoning.

premises leading to aconclusion. ¢ Arguments are valid if the premises, if true, definitely lead to a conclusion. Assertion and Reasoning e These questions have one assertion (A) and one rea- son (R). e You determine if A is true and if R correctly explains A. * You choose from options like 'A is true but R is false’ or ‘Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explana- tion of A. Example: ¢ Assertion (A): Tides indicate regular rise and fall in sea level. Reason (R): Tides result from the moon’s gravj tional pull. Explanation: A is true, and R is a valid explana tion, so the answer is (c) 'Both A and R are true and R is not the correct explanation of A.’ Statements and Courses of Action e A course of action is a step or decision to improve. situation. * You decide which courses of action logically follo based on the situation. Example: ° Situation: Incessant rains have caused floodin, due to a silt-filled river bed. * Courses of actions: I. Transfer people near th river to safety. II. Inform people about the dangey III. Remove silt and mud from the river. ¢ Explanation: I and II are immediate action needed to’save lives, so they follow. III may not b practical, so it doesn’t follow. Knowledge is considered to be ‘luminous’ (WAIST) at the. highest level; knowledge means to illuminate something ‘Truth’ (4@) and ‘knowledge’ (a4) are similar in nature, After asking, ‘Can I know? (al # a@ GH wera E 2), th next question is obviously ‘How do I know?’ (48 #a etl ?) or ‘What are the sources of knowledge?’ (aM & it wt S 2). Epistemology is the study of the origin, nature, an limits of human knowledge. Logic (@) is the study of inference and argument. The logi and theory of knowledge of Indian systems are largely colore by their metaphysical tenets. Philosophy (#34) basically deals. with the interpretation of man and nature. It is the analysis, assessment, and exposition of the process of knowledge. : In general, knowledge is gained through different. means. We have already discussed inductive (STRAY), deductive (FATA), and many aspects in Unit 1. Now. we are learning experiential knowledge also that is impor- tant in the Indian system.

Title: Overview of the Vedic Age and Vedas

Text:
The Vedic Age (1500-500 BCE) is the period between the Bronze Age and the early Iron Age. Vedas belong to the orthodox sys- tem because they all have recognized the ultimate _ authority of the Vedas. Vedas were assumed to be linked with influential Brahmanical thought, which later met some resistance in the form of Jainism and Buddhism. It is also related to the Indo-Aryan tribe. The Vedic period defined the real nature of the soul or the philosophy about the soul and cosmic prin- ciple (or Brahman) which represented the ‘ultimate ‘irst an reality’. Its six different darshans are also called ‘Shad Darshan’ (3S af). The post-Vedic period is a systematic period. Of the sys- tems of thought or philosophy, six became more famous than the others. Gautama’s Nyaya, Kinnada’sVishishti,. realist, Kapila’s Samkhya, Patanjali’s Yoga, Jaimini’s Purva- Mimamsa, and Badarayana’s Uttara Mimamsa or Vedanta. All of them accept the authority of the Vedas. Vedic literature has developed in four phases, with the Ved s events _ Samhita (@@ ¥fem), Brahmin (SEA), Aranyaka (SRV), ay occul. and Upanishads (34492) being the key components. ‘ing our Ved Samhita (a Gea) includes mantras and hymns and has four main types: 1. Rigveda (8): The Rigveda is one of the oldest sacred texts in the Indian subcontinent. It is a col- lection of hymns and praises, often referred to as a ‘song of praise.' These hymns are dedicated to vari- ous deities and natural forces, serving as a founda- tional text in Hinduism and providing insights into the religious and cultural practices of ancient India. 2. Yajurveda (esqd@): The Yajurveda contains a combination of prose and poetry and is primar- ily associated with the performance of rituals, especially the Yagya rituals. It provides instruc- tions and formulas for conducting these rituals, making it an essential text for priests and scholars involved in Vedic ceremonies. 3. Samaveda (@Tae): The Samaveda is character- ized by its predominant use of song and music. It consists of melodies and chants that were sung dur- ing religious ceremonies and rituals. The Samaveda is closely associated with the melodies used in the chanting of hymns found in the Rigveda. 4.

Summary:
The Vedic Age, spanning from 1500-500 BCE, marked a period of influential Brahmanical thought centered around the Vedas, which later faced resistance from Jainism and Buddhism, with key texts including the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Upanishads.

It consists of melodies and chants that were sung dur- ing religious ceremonies and rituals. The Samaveda is closely associated with the melodies used in the chanting of hymns found in the Rigveda. 4. Atharva Veda (31%d42): The Atharva Veda con- tains a diverse range of content, with its primary focus on the Samhita or Mantra portion. Unlike the other Vedas, it is not primarily associated with rituals and sacrifices. Instead, it deals with various aspects of life, including medicine, sci- ence, philosophy, and incantations for addressing everyday issues and challenges. It is sometimes referred to as the 'Veda of magical formulas’ due to its broader scope of subjects. The Manusmriti (4q=4fa) is another important text of Indian practice. It discusses religious, social, and moral duties. 2. Upanishad period (safe @1€1): During this period, students took refuge in the Guru to gain the secrets of knowledge. The Upanishads are believed to have been composed between 1000 and 800 BC, and possibly as far back as 600 BC. In this period, there was considerable development of Yagya culture in North India. The cen- tral ideas in the Upanishads are Brahman and Atman. Later Vedic period or Vedanta (Aart @iet): This era is between about 1400 BC to 600 BC. During this period, the society was divided into four varnas. In this period, Brahmins were given more priority because the responsibility of protecting the Vedas was considered to be theirs. The Indian tradition of philosophy is determined by two directions: ‘astika’ (sft) and ‘nastika’ (afer). The following elements are important in making a clas sification about the different philosophies: 1. Atheist ($avarét) direction accepts supernatural and spiritual beings like God, soul, reincarnation, heaven- hell, etc., while the atheist direction does not accept these powers. === Page 28 === 2. Only Charvaka philosophy (arate egies) does not accept any supernatural and spiritual authority, rec- ognizing only the material world. 3. Buddhism and Jainism accept theories like reincarna- tion and soul, respectively, but not spiritual beings, so these philosophies are also called atheists. 4.

Summary:
The Vedas consist of melodies and chants used in religious ceremonies, with the Atharva Veda focusing on a diverse range of subjects and the Upanishad period emphasizing knowledge from Gurus, while the later Vedic period prioritized Brahmins and classified philosophies as either 'astika' or 'nastika'.

rec- ognizing only the material world. 3. Buddhism and Jainism accept theories like reincarna- tion and soul, respectively, but not spiritual beings, so these philosophies are also called atheists. 4. Nyaya, Vaisheshika, and Mimamsa (24, Sfafitar si iM) philosophies have been ‘considered realist under the astik philosophy because they accept both the spiritual and supernatural and the material world. Mimamsa philosophy does not accept God. 5. Prakriti (4afA) is also given priority in Sankhya phi- losophy (Wi@rexi7). The post-Vedic period is a systematic period that saw - the development of orthodox systems. Cuarvaka Mareriatist ScHoo.’s Views oF KNOWLEDGE (erates silfaes siren free ara) Rishi Brihaspati Gefs gees) was the founder of this school. Charvaka is also called Lokayata (era), which is the Sanskrit word for ‘worldly ones’ that is the meaning understood by common people. As we discussed, ‘pratyaksha’ (Wea) is the only source of valid knowledge. Only direct perception ‘anubhava’ (S174) is recognized. What we cannot perceive through senses must be treated as non-existent. They refute all other sources of knowledge—no mind, no consciousness, and then no soul. Only the physical body is real. There are four traditional elements—earth, water, fire, and air. The validity of inference is also rejected by Charvakas. Inference is considered to be a mere leap into the dark. We proceed from the known to the unknown, and there is no certainty in this, though some inferences may _ turn out to be accidentally true. Induction is uncertain, and deduction is arguing in a circle. Deductive inference is vitiated by the fallacy of ‘petition principia.’ Though we consider invariable association or ‘Vyapti’ (=nft) as the nerve of all inferences, Charvakas chal- lenge this and regard it as guesswork. Perception does not approve this Vyapati. Inference and testimony do not approve it. Charvaka reviews perception as valid and inference as invalid, as it is the result of inference. The cre- ations, such as Kautilya’sArthashastra (s1¢f3re — Science of Material Gain), are based on it as it is considered to be a hedonist opportunist approach.

Summary:
Some philosophies, such as Buddhism and Jainism, are considered atheists because they only recognize the material world, while others, like Nyaya, Vaisheshika, and Mimamsa, accept both the spiritual and supernatural along with the material world.

OrtHopox Views of KNOWLEDGE Nyaya Philosophy (=arzesta) Nyaya philosophy is very important as per the sylla- bus. It was primarily given by the sage ‘Gotama’ (dif- ferent from Bhagwan Gautam Buddha). His creation is ‘Aksapada’(S1a&4@). This school is also known as ‘tarak- shastra’ (ThA — science of reasoning), ‘pramanashas- tra’ (WATMIRIA — science of logic and epistemology), ‘hetu- vidya’ (eaferen — science of causes), ‘vadavidya’ ( — science of debate), ‘anviksiki’? (sFtférnt — science of critical study). This school is associated with ‘atomistic pluralig, (CHAMETA FEI) and logical realism, ultimately aiming at the ‘liberation of the individual self. It is linked with material and spiritual aspects as ultimate constituents 6 the world. The study involves both internal and externa aspects of knowledge. The sources of knowledge inclug, perception, inference, comparison, and verbal testimony The objects of learning are self, body, sense organs sense objects, intellect, mind, and activity. Knowledge is the knowledge of things, and it const; tutes the expression of reality (‘arthabhava’). Whateve its type, it is a natural response to the disposition presep; in the human mind. , Vaisheshika Philosophy (Asif af) The Vaisheshika sutras are the oldest ones and were writ ten by Kannada, shortly before Gautama’s Nyaya Sutras The word ‘Vishesa’ (fa81§) means particularity and empha. sizes the significance of individuals. It recognizes three rea] objects of experience as substance, quality, and activity, © There are three products of intellectual discriming tion: generality, particularity, and combination. Like the Nyaya school, this school also acknowledges perception, inference, comparison, and verbal testimony as the valid sources of knowledge. Sankhya Philosophy (eenest) The founder of Samkhya’ philosophy was the famous sage Kapil. The Samkhya system is also called ‘dualis tic’ ( ). It believes in Prakriti and Purushartha.

Summary:
Nyaya philosophy, Vaisheshika philosophy, and Sankhya philosophy are important schools of thought that emphasize different aspects of knowledge and reality, with Nyaya focusing on logic and epistemology, Vaisheshika on individuality, and Sankhya on dualism between Prakriti and Purushartha.

Kumarila defines that valid knowledge is free from causes and from defects and is not contra- dicted by subsequent knowledge. 7. Anupalabdhi (3™uUefet): While Mimansa primarily focuses on the interpretation of the Vedas and ritual practices, it may not emphasize the concept of 'anupal- abdhi' (sT7quefs), which is non-apprehension, as a sepa- rate means of knowledge, as found in Nyaya philosophy. As per Bhadrayana’s (“1&T) perspective, which is cen- tral to Uttara Mimamsa ( ia) and Vedanta (aaa), knowledge is derived from sacred scriptures (Sruti) and other authoritative texts (Smriti). Here, 'Sruti' refers to the Vedas, and 'Smriti' encompasses sources such as the Bhagavad Gita, Mahabharata, and Laws of Manu. In the Sankhya (@f€1) philosophy, both the validity (pramanya - Wa) and invalidity (Apramanya - 31TH") of knowledge are considered self-evident. Anything that becomes apparent at a given moment has always existed in a latent state within.

Summary:

Jainism came to prominence in the 6th century B.C., when Lord Mahavira propagated the religion. There were 24 great teachers (tirthankaras -dtef), the last of whom was Lord Mahavira. Tirthankaras attained all knowledge and were liberated (that is called as Moksha -4a). The first Tirthankara was Rishabnatha. ‘Kalpa Sutra’ (#euqa) is a biography of numerous Tirthankaras with a primary interest in Vardhaman Mahavira and Parshvanatha. Lord Mahavira has given five ‘Mahavrats’ (Great vows - (Helaa) — truth (Aer), non-violence (‘sf€a?), non-steal- ing (‘ ’), non-possession (‘ ), extraversion/celi- bacy (‘afeaeadysetat’). Three Jewels for ‘Triratna’ are: === Page 30 === 1. Right Faith (Samyakdarshana’ — wWeHeRy), 2. Right Knowledge (‘Samyakjnana’ ~ Wx), 3. Right Action (Samyakcharita’ - wa ait). Jainism is divided into two categories ~ ‘Digambar’ (feria) and ‘Shwetambar’ (2afaQ. Digambaras worship the Tirthankaras in a non-anthropomorphic form while shwetamabar rely on the original Jain scriptures, includ- ing the Agamas. The latter ones are more liberal in their approach, even towards women. The ultimate objective of Jainism is to achieve ‘Moksha’ (Ala ~ the ultimate libera- tion) chrough ‘Kaivalya’ (aes). Jains have critically examined the valid sources of knowledge.

Summary:
The validity and invalidity of knowledge are self-evident, with six systems of post-vedic philosophy contributing to understanding logic, epistemology, atomistic theory of matter, dualistic metaphysics, meditation, ritual, dharma, and the nature of Brahman, while Jainism and Buddhism, as heterodox schools of philosophy, focus on achieving liberation through critical examination of valid sources of knowledge.

even towards women. The ultimate objective of Jainism is to achieve ‘Moksha’ (Ala ~ the ultimate libera- tion) chrough ‘Kaivalya’ (aes). Jains have critically examined the valid sources of knowledge. Here, knowledge is of two kinds: 1. ‘Pramana’ (WAM) refers to the knowledge of a thing as itis. 2. ‘Naya’ (1) or knowledge of a thing in its reflection. It means the standpoint of thought from which we make a statement about a thing. All truth is relative to our standpoint. Partial knowledge of one of the innu- merable aspects of a thing is called ‘naya,’ Both ‘Pramana’ and ‘Naya’ are essential for the full and true knowledge of a thing. ‘Mediate knowledge’ is any knowledge which the soul comes to have by the media- tion of sense organs; any knowledge whose acquisition involves something other than the soul itself. On the other hand, ‘immediate knowledge’ is that which the soul obtains without the intervention of the sense organs. Avadhi Shruta Manahparyaya Kevaia Matti Figure 6.7. Knowledge as per Jainism 1. Immediate Knowledge (Getat HT) (i) Avadhi (a7af&): This is the direct knowledge of things even at a distance of space or time. It is called Avadhi or ‘limited’ because it functions within a particular area and up to a particular time. It cannot go beyond spatial and temporal limits. (ii) Manahparyaya (aaaafan: This is the direct knowledge of the thoughts of others (telepathy), which is limited to space and time conditions. Both Avadhi and Manahparyaya are called extra-sen- sory forms of knowledge, as the soul is unaided by the senses or mind in obtaining direct knowledge. (ii)Kevala Jnana (at Ha): This is absolute, extraordinary, and ‘infinite knowledge. It is not limited by space, time, or object and can be acquired only by liberated souls. These thy, kinds of immediate knowledge may be calle, extra-ordinary and extra-sensory Perception Avadhi is clairvoyance; Manahparyaya is telep thy; and Kevala is omniscience. 2. Mediate Knowledge (wert aT) The instruments of ‘mati’ and ‘shruta’ knowledge g perception, inference, and authority. : (i) Mati (af): This includes perceptual and infer. ential knowledge.

Therefore, it is included in mediate knowledge. Pure perception, in the sense of mere sensation, can- not rank the title of knowledge. It must be given mean: ing and arranged into order by conception or thought, Perceptual knowledge is, therefore, regarded as medi- ate since it presupposes the activity of thought. Medi. ate knowledge is divided into ‘mati’ and ‘shruta’, Mati includes both perceptual and inferential knowledge According to Jaina Epistemology (4 WA wea & STAN), indirect knowledge is of five kinds:. Smrti (cafa) — Valid Knowledge. Pratyabhijna (weafita) — Recognition. Tarka (ah) — Logic. Anumana (SPAM) — Inference. Agama (377PT8) — Words of Reliable People Here, we can discuss two important aspects. Gib Whe 1. Naya Vada (Taare): This means a standpoint of thought from which we make a statement about a thing. All truth is relative to our standpoints. Partial knowledge of one of the innumerable aspects of a thing is called ‘Naya.’ 2. Syad Vada or Saptabhangi (tare arzar wa wit): This is the most important part of Jaina logic. Accord- ing to this, we can know only some aspects of reality, and so all our judgments are relative. It is a theory of the relativity of knowledge—what is true in my eyes may be wrong in the eyes of others. The process of practical perception in Jainism is given as under: 1. Avagrah (2T4%@): Distinguishing the type, horse, cow, or man, without detailing the main features. 2. tha ($8): Inquiring about whereabouts, country, direction, etc. 3. Avaya (814): Correct identification. 4.

Summary:
Jain epistemology categorizes knowledge into mediate knowledge, which includes perceptual and inferential knowledge, and indirect knowledge, which includes recognition, logic, inference, and words of reliable people, emphasizing the relativity of truth and the limitations of human perception.

This event is known as arma-Chakra-Pravartana (turning of the wheel of law). nets of Buddhism (alggerd a Rrgra) ddha asked his followers to avoid indulgence in worldly asures. They were told to follow the practice of strict stinence and asceticism. He ascribed instead the ‘Madhyam Marg’ (8274 urf — middle path that was to be followed. Buddhism teaches that human life is filled with suffer- , which is caused by our desires and attachments. It sents the Four Noble Truths (af Get) as follows: Suffering (Dukkha — :%@) is the essence of the world. Every suffering has a cause (Samudaya — Wea). Suffering could be extinguished (Nirodha — faver). There is a path that leads to the end of suffering (Magga - art), It can be achieved by following the Eight Fold Path. ht Fold Paths (31am ar): These practices are linked h knowledge, conduct, and meditative practices.

According to Vaibhasika, the knowledge of external objects can also be gained through perception. According to Vaibhasika, the inference of things exter- nal to knowledge is self-contradictory. If all the external objects are inferred by their knowledge, then nothing can be known by perception. In the absence of perception, there can be no relation of concomitance between the major and the minor premise, without which no inference is possible. This is opposed to actual experience. The Vaibhasikas accept the presence of the external things and conceive them as subject to perception. To them, by Pramana (WAM), only direct knowledge is possible. The Pramanas (FHM) are of two types, namely Pratyaksa (Yat Perception) and Anumana (S14 — Inference). Both these Pramanas (WAM) are known as Samyagjnana (G@20ar — Right Knowledge), and it is by these that all the purush- arthas (Jeet — Pursuits of Life) are attained. Pratyaksa (wea) is the knowledge that is without any imagination and error. This knowledge is of four types: 1.

Summary:
The importance of following the Five Precepts and the different philosophical ideas among the four schools of thought in Buddhism are discussed in relation to achieving right knowledge and pursuing the goals of life.

, and it is by these that all the purush- arthas (Jeet — Pursuits of Life) are attained. Pratyaksa (wea) is the knowledge that is without any imagination and error. This knowledge is of four types: 1. Indriya Jnana (sat WA) - Knowledge through senses. Mano Vigyan (ritfagar) — Sensual knowledge in the form of samanatarapratyaya (G4rIn Wears- common mental content) after the knowledge through senses. 3. Self-awareness (Atma Samvedana - 31 Waa): Thisis the manifestation of chitta (consciousness), and its attributes are experienced as pleasure and pain in their true form. 4. Yogic Knowledge (Yogic Jnana —afte% Hr): It rep- resents the ultimate knowledge of things perceptible through various Pramanas (valid sources of knowl- edge). Inference comes in two forms: * Svartha (For oneself — taa & fet): In this case, the evidence is inferential. For example, if there’s a fire on the hill, the hill is the evidence (linga), and the fire is inferred (anumana). The evidence remains on the self-side (svapaksha), similar to a kitchen, without involving the opposite side (vipaksha), like a pool of water. There are two major sects of Buddhism: 1. Mahayana Buddhism (neta ager): This branch regards Gautama Buddha as a divine being who guided his followers to attain nirvana, the ultimate liberation from desires and expectations in this birth, leading to freedom from the cycles of birth and death. === Page 32 === 2. Hinayana Buddhism (arrara aitez etl): This sect of Buddhists considers Gautama Buddha as an ordinary human being who achieved Nirvana. Buddhism encompasses three doctrinal principles: 1. Aneeshwarvaad (Atheism — 3Mitsrare a sturaate): This philosophical position or belief that denies the existence of God or gods. The followers do not believe in the authority of God. 2. Anatmvaad (No-Soul Doctrine -— 3t4aTeare): It asserts that what is commonly referred to as 'soul' is actually the integral flow of consciousness. Buddhism uniquely denies the existence of an unchanging, per- manent self or essence. 3. Kshanikvaad (Momentariness — aftreate): This doctrine claims that all universal things are momen- tary in nature.

Summary:
Different types of knowledge, including sensory, mental, self-awareness, and yogic knowledge, are essential for attaining the pursuits of life, with Buddhism encompassing various doctrinal principles and sects.

The three pitakas include: 1. Sutta Pitaka (Basket of Discourses ~qa faes): This section comprises discussions and discourses and is the largest part of Buddhist teachings. 2. Vinaya Pitaka (Basket of Discipline — fara fireen): It contains a set of rules and guidelines followed by monks and nuns to lead a disciplined monastic life within the Sangha (Buddhist monastic community). 3.

ComPaRING BupDHISM AND JAINISM Both Buddhism and Jainism emerged as movements to reform Hinduism. These religions emphasized using lan- guages spoken by the masses, such as Prakrit and Pali, rather than Sanskrit. They are rooted in Vedic religion and indebted to the Upanishads. ° Buddhism (ag et) centers around the life and teachings of Gautama Buddha and is polytheistic, aiming to achieve enlightenment. e Jainism ( at) is also polytheistic, focusing on non-violence and the liberation of the soul. Buddhism views life as suffering and seeks to escape suffering by eliminating desires and ignorance through the Eightfold Path. Jainism emphasizes respecting all liv- ing things and attaining liberation by avoiding and shed- ding bad karma, which causes rebirth and suffering. PRAMANA (WaruT)-Source oF KNOWLEDGE The discipline of inference is known as logic, and its pur- pose is to elucidate the principles governing the process of making inferences.

PRAMANA (WaruT)-Source oF KNOWLEDGE The discipline of inference is known as logic, and its pur- pose is to elucidate the principles governing the process of making inferences. Inferences represent rule-based transitions from one or more statements, referred to premises, to another statement known as the conclusig A deductive inference aims to be valid, which means ¢ conclusion must be true if the premises are true. All oth inferences are considered inductive. Our discussion primarily centers around the Nyay,, (=14) system. Vatsayana defines Pramana as a source 9 means of obtaining valid knowledge. Gautama’s Nyaya Sutra defines perception as an awareness that: | 1. Arises from the connection between the sense organ and the object. 2. Is not derived from words. 3. Does not deviate from its object, meaning it is alway true. 4. Possesses the nature of certainty. In any act of knowledge, four essential factors come into play: The knower (Pramata ~— WATdT) The object of knowledge (Prameya -WAa) The means of valid knowledge (Pramana~ arm) The result of valid knowledge (Prama —34) Knowledge can be categorized into two types: 1. Prama (Valid Knowledge - ¥%): Also known as 'pre sentative knowledge,' it occurs when the object o knowledge is directly accessible to the knower. There are four types of valid knowledge, including percep tion, inference, comparison, and sabda (verbal testi mony). 2. Aprama (Invalid Knowledge - 314): This pertains to the erroneous apprehension of an object and include: memory (smriti), doubt (smasya), error (viparyaya) and hypothetical reasoning (tarka). Hence, pramana is the valid means of knowledge. It ha four important means: 1. Pratyaksa (44% —Perception) 2. Anumana (144A —Inference) 3. Upamana (Sv4™ —Comparison) 4.

The Advaita school of thought concept was given by Adi Shankaracharya dur- ing 8th century CE. He argued that the individual self or essence (S14I- Atman) is identical to Brahman, and that the world of appearances (Maya) is an illusion. Svikalpak - Discriminate perception (afameum) - Distinguishing features are both observed and rec- ognized. It has a name, color, shape, etc. It provides direct knowledge of the object.

Summary:
Perception is a valid form of knowledge that originates from the contact of an object with a sense organ, involving elements such as the self, mind, sense organs, and objects, and can be of two types: Nirvikalpak, where the object is perceived without distinguishing features, and Svikalpak, where distinguishing features are observed and recognized.

It applies to all cases of perception, human or divine. en God’s omniscience has the highest degree of imme- acy conceivable. Perception is divided into the following two categories: » Ordinary perception (eitfench) — Knowledge results from the contact of the sense organs with external means th objects. - Extraordinary perception (3teilfema) — It has three distinctions: a. Samanyalakshana (Mat aa) - Perception of universals/classes. Universals represent all the particulars of the class being discussed. b. Jnana lakshana (3M Ma) - Knowledge traits. For instance, on seeing the tree of ‘sandalwood (chandan),’ we can recall its strong fragrance. c. Yogaja (4lT§) - Intuition. This is extraordinary perception found in gurus and rishis, involving supernatural powers and intuitive and immediate perception of all objects, past, pres- ent, and future. According to later logicians, there are two kinds of ver- bal testimony: 1. Vaidika or Alaukika (@f&@ or atime) — Also known as divine or scriptural testimony. The Vedas are spo- ken by God. This testimony is considered divine and perfect. 2. Laukika or secular (ifs or RET) — Known as secular testimony.

atime) — Also known as divine or scriptural testimony. The Vedas are spo- ken by God. This testimony is considered divine and perfect. 2. Laukika or secular (ifs or RET) — Known as secular testimony. Human beings are not perfect, so only the words of trustworthy individuals can be con- sidered as laukika. The former relates to the words of God, while the Vedas are created by God and are therefore considered perfectly valid. The latter pertains to the words of trustworthy peo- ple. According to Nyayikas, since human beings are not perfect, only the words of trustworthy people can be con- sidered as Laukika Shabda. Anumana (3r7aTT — Inference) The term 'Anumana' indicates knowledge that comes after earlier knowledge (214 — after, 4 — knowledge). Inference (314M) is the second source of valid knowl- edge. It is defined as the knowledge of an object (fet - lingi) due to a previous knowledge of some sign or mark (fet - ling). Gautama defines it as a specific form. of knowledge preceded by perception. The perception of the invariable relation between the proban (fe - ling) and the probandum (fe - lingi) is a previous perception of such a relation somewhere else. Again, the perception of the proban is invariably related to the probandum as it exists in the locus. 'Probandum' refers to the matter to be proven or demonstrated in an argument, discussion, this can be also be termed as apnigrheet ( ) that is yet to be proven. Shabda (318% — Verbal Testimony) According to Nyaya (14) Philosophy, Shabda is the fourth and last valid source of knowledge. Shabda liter- ally means verbal knowledge. The mere combination of words does not provide valid knowledge. All verbal statements are not valid. Hence, Gautama defines shabdapramana (UHM) as the statement of a. reliable person. In other words, verbal testimony is the communication from a trustworthy person, who is trustworthy (314 —apta), and why is assertion (S7¢3I — upadesa) a testimony (WAM — pramana)? Analyzing the process of verbal testimony, we find the following steps: First, there is the perception of the words of a sentence uttered by a trustworthy person. === Page 34 ===.

Summary:
The Nyaya philosophy distinguishes between divine testimony from God and secular testimony from trustworthy individuals, with inference and verbal testimony also being sources of valid knowledge.

We’ve noticed that whenever there’s smoke, there’s fire. 2. Paksadharmata (uerenfat): Here, we infer some- thing specific, like fire on a hill (4éTS), because we see smoke there. It’s like saying, 'Where there’s smoke, there’s fire on that hill.’ In inference, we don’t directly see things; it’s like solv- ing a puzzle. We use a clue called ‘hetu’ (€@) or a mark to make our conclusion. For example, when we see smoke on a distant hill, we remember the general connection (Vyapti) between smoke and fire and conclude there’s fire on the hill. So, we can break it down like this: 1. This hill has fire (pratijna-faanr). 2. Because it has smoke (hetu-@q). 3. Whatever. has smoke has fire, for example, an oven (udaharana-3aIee). 4. This hill has smoke, which is invariably associated with fire (upanaya—St4). 5. Therefore, this hill has fire (nigamana—fT) In Indian syllogism, these five parts are called Avayavas (aaa) In Aristotelian syllogism, the character we're figuring out (fire) is called sadhya; the clue (smoke) is the hetu, and the subject (hill) is paksa. It’s like major, middle, and minor terms. Linga Paramarsa (fei wrist): In Nyaya syllogism, we have five terms. The middle term works as a bridge between the major and minor terms and plays a crucial role in proving a syllogism is right or wrong. This connec- tion between the middle term and major term is called linga-paramarsha. There are five qualities of a middle term: Vyapti (Invariable Relation — euft): Vyapti means there’s always a connection between the middle term and the major term. For example, where there’s smoke, there’s always fire. But remember, not everything with fire has smoke, like a red-hot iron ball. Vyapti can be of two types: 1. Samvyapti (teat): When two things are always together, like ‘nameable’ and ‘knowable.’ If something is nameable, it’s also knowable. 2.

Summary:
Anumana is a form of inference in Indian philosophy that involves connecting the dots between observed phenomena, using clues or marks to make conclusions, with five parts called Avayavas, including the middle term which plays a crucial role in proving a syllogism is right or wrong.

It’s all about the relationship, whether it’s a cause- and-effect relationship or not. There are three types: 1. Purvavat Inference (Wat 3T{ATT): We figure out something we haven’t seen (like future rain) from something we have seen (like dark, heavy clouds). Sesavat Inference ( 3Tqart): We guess some- thing we haven’t seen (like past rain) from something we have seen (like fast, muddy river water). 3. Samanyatodrasta Inference (erates STAT): This is different. We don’t rely on cause and effect. We just notice things happening in a pattern. For exam- ple, we see the moon in different places over time, so we conclude it moves even if we haven’t seen the actual motion.

Summary:
Vyapti can be of two types, Samvyapti and Asamvyapti, with five ways to establish Vyapti including Anvaya and Vyatireka, and inference is classified based on the nature of the connection between the clue and what's inferred, such as Purvavat, Sesavat, and Samanyatodrasta Inference.

rely on cause and effect. We just notice things happening in a pattern. For exam- ple, we see the moon in different places over time, so we conclude it moves even if we haven’t seen the actual motion. Mipp_e Term (am or fei) In ancient Indian philosophy, the middle term is a critical component of logical reasoning and inference and is used to demonstrate the logical relationship between the sub- ject (minor term - Wat) and the conclusion (ate#- major term) through the presence of a specific characteristic or concept (middle term). The middle term is a fundamental concept in Indian logic and is used to establish a connection between the major term (M1®4) and the minor term (4&1) ina syllogism. The breakdown of these terms is given as under: Major Term (tie): The major term represents the con- clusion or the statement you want to prove or infer. For example, in the case of 'The hill has fire,’ the major term is ‘fire’ (S11). Minor Term (a): The minor term represents the subject | or the specific case in which you want to establish the con- clusion. In our example, the minor term is 'the hill' (4ers). Middle Term (a@& or fei): The middle term acts as a bridge or connector between the major and minor terms. It is a concept or characteristic that links the major and minor terms. In our example, the middle term is 'smoke' (44). The presence of the middle term (smoke) is used to demonstrate the connection between the major term (fire) and the minor term (the hill). The purpose of the middle term is to establish a logical connection, often called Vyapti (fa), between the major and minor terms. This connection is essential for valid inference. In Indian logic, a valid syllogism or inference depends on the presence of the middle term to establish this connection. Hetvasuasa (Ancient BHARATIYA FALLACY System - @arata) Hetvabhasa is an ancient Bharatiya Sanskrit term th translates to 'fallacy' in English. In the context of Bharat; logic, Hetvabhasa refers to a fallacious or invalid arg ment. In other words, it’s a situation where the midd term seems to be a reason but is not a valid reason to sy port the conclusion.

Summary:
The concept of the middle term in ancient Indian philosophy is crucial for logical reasoning and inference, acting as a bridge between the major and minor terms to establish a logical connection for valid inference, while Hetvabhasa refers to fallacious or invalid arguments where the middle term may seem like a reason but is not valid to support the conclusion.

All fallacies in the ancient system a considered 'material (silfaam a aredfaen) fallacies.' Features of a Valid Middle Term To have a valid middle term, it must meet the followin, conditions: ; 1. Presence in the Minor Term (aareratat): The middle term must be present in the minor term. For instance in the case of the argument, 'The hill has fire,' the mj dle term, such as 'smoke,' must be present in the hill. 2. Presence in All Positive Instances (aueTeTg The middle term should be present in all (positive) instances where the major term is present. For exam. ple, if we say, ‘Fire exists in the kitchen because it has smoke,' then the middle term 'smoke' must be present where there’s fire. 3. Absence in All Negative Instances (fauat Conversely, the middle term should be absent in a (negative) instances where the major term is absen For instance, if there’s no fire in a lake, then 'smoke’ should also be absent in the lake. a 4. Non-Incompatibility with the Minor Term ( stanfért): The middle term must not prove something contradictory, especially concerning the minor term For example, it should not demonstrate the coolness. of fire if that’s not the intended conelusion. 5. Absence of Counteracting Reasons (aaa The middle term must not be contradicted by other reasons that lead to a contradictory conclusion. I other words, there should be no conflicting evidence that disproves the middle term’s validity. Types of Hetvabhasa 1. Asiddha (stftg): This is the fallacy of the unproved middle. The middle term must be present in the minor term, but if it is not, it is unproved. This type of fallacy. has three subtypes: (a) Ashraya asiddha (31314 31f&z): The minor term is the locus of the middle term, but if the minor termis unreal, the middle term cannot be present in it.

in it. (b) Svarupaasiddha (tarey sifeg): Here, svarupa (S467) means 'own form’ or ‘essential nature’. In this case, the minor term is not unreal, but the middle term cannot be its very nature and be. present in the minor term. For example, Sound is a quality because it is. visible. Let us look at the following terms === Page 37 === 1. Minor Term: 'Sound' - This is the subject of our argument. Middle Term: 'Quality' - This is the term being used to establish a link between the minor term (sound) and the major term (visible). Major Term: ‘Visible’ - This is what the argument is trying to prove about sound. 3. In the given example, the fallacy occurs because the argument wrongly asserts that sound (minor term) is a ‘quality’ (middle term) because it is 'vis- ible’ (major term). Vyapyatva asiddha (earera sift): Here, the Vyapti (relation) is conditional, and thus, the middle term becomes fallacious when applied to cases where the condition does not hold. _ Savyabhichara or Anaikantika (aeafitrert or aiatfeades ): This is the fallacy of the irregular middle. It can be further categorized into three types: (a) Sadharana (eT): In this case, the mid- dle term is too wide, and it is taken as a ‘mixed land,' being present in both positive and negative instances. This violates the rule that the middle term should not be present in negative instances. ¢ Example: Claiming 'The hill has fire because it is knowable' is an example. Here, 'knowable' is present in both fiery and non-fiery objects. (b) Asadharana (31TetewoT): Here, the middle term is too narrow, being present only in the 'paksha' (minor term) and nowhere else. This violates the rule that the middle term should be present in the ‘sapaksha' (positive instances). it is audible' is an example. ‘Audible’ applies only to sound and nowhere else. Anupasamhari (3tudert): The fallacy of Anupsamhari (non-exclusive middle term) occurs when the middle term of an argument does not cover all of the members of the minor term. In this case, the middle term 'knowable' does not cover all of the members of the minor term ‘all things.’ Some things, such as numbers and concepts, are knowable but eternal.

Summary:
The fallacy of Anupasamhari occurs when the middle term of an argument does not cover all of the members of the minor term, violating the rule that the middle term should be present in all instances.

In this case, the middle term 'knowable' does not cover all of the members of the minor term ‘all things.’ Some things, such as numbers and concepts, are knowable but eternal. The minor term is all-inclu- sive and leaves nothing as sapaksha or vipaksha. ° Example: Claiming ‘All things are non-eternal because they are knowable' is an example. This is an example of a non-exclusive middle, where the minor term is all-inclusive and leaves nothing as sapaksha or vipaksha. nit.

Here, ‘journey’ and ‘recovery’ are middle terms and these objectives were inter- rupted or prevented. The Sanskrit word ‘badhit' (aft) means 'obstructed,' ‘interrupted,’ or ‘prevented.’ It is used in Indian logic to describe a fallacy that occurs when the middle term of an argument is contradicted by direct percep- tion or a piece of stronger evidence. Example 1: All birds can fly because they have wings. Penguins have wings. Therefore, penguins can fly. The middle is ‘wings’ in this argument. However, we know from direct perception that not all animals with wings can fly. Therefore, the middle term is contradicted and the argument is fallacious. Example 2: Stating 'Fire is cold because it is a substance’ is an example. Here, the middle term 'substance' is directly contradicted by perception. 4. Viruddha (fae): This is the contradictory middle, where the middle term, instead of being connected to the major term, is connected to the absence of the major term. It proves the non-existence of the major term in the minor term.

Summary:
The fallacy of non-exclusive middle occurs when the middle term does not cover all members of the minor term, as seen in the example of claiming 'All things are non-eternal because they are knowable.'

This statement contradicts the middle term 'substance' because it attributes the quality of 'cold' to the sub- stance ‘fire,' which is a contradiction, making jit Fi example of the Badhit fallacy according to Nyaya (cla sical Indian school of logic). The correct answer is (c) The Svarupasiddha fallacy is a fallacy in which the middle term of an argument is incompatible with the. minor term. In other words, the middle term canny, be a part of the minor term. In the argument 'Sound is a quality because it is Vis. ible,' the middle term is 'visible.' However, sound can. not be visible. Sound is an auditory sensation, while visibility is a visual sensation. Therefore, the middie term is incompatible with the minor term, and the argument is fallacious.

’ and the middle term is 'Socrates.' 68. Which of the following is a necessary condition for a set of propositions to be considered logically consistent? (a) All propositions must be universally true. (b) The propositions can be true at the same time. === Page 4 === (c) Each proposition must be logically derived from the others. (d) The propositions must all be of the same logical type (e.g., all categorical). In the syllogism 'All mammals are vertebrates; All dogs are mammals; Therefore, all dogs are verte- brates,' identify the middle term and its role: (a) 'Mammals,' as the predicate in both premises. (b) 'Vertebrates,' as subject in the major premise, predicate in the minor. (c) ‘Mammals,’ as subject in the major premise, predicate in the minor. (d) ‘Dogs,’ as predicate in the major premise, subject in the minor. 70. What's the main difference between a proposition and a syllogism? (a) A proposition is just one statement that can be true or false. A syllogism is a group of these state- ments put together to come up with a conclusion. (b) A proposition and a syllogism are the same thing; both are just statements that can be true or false. (c) A syllogism is one statement about logic, and a proposition is a bunch of these to make a conclusion. (d) Both are types of arguments, but a proposition has three parts, and a syllogism has only two. 71. Which of the statements are true in the context of propositions ? (a) ‘Some flowers are green’ is a particular affirma- tive proposition. (b) ‘Some Indians are not spiritual’ is a particular negative proposition. (c) The term distributed applies to its entire extent. (d) All of the above 72. Which of the following statement/s is/are true? (a) When a term refers only to a part of the class of things denoted by the term, it is said to be undis- tributed, for example, some dogs are friendly. (b) In a universal affirmative proposition, only the subject is distributed, for example, all cats are mammals, where all cats are subject. (c) In a universal negative proposition, both the subject and the predicate are distributed, such as for example, no birds are mammals. 77. A logic professor uses moods to analyze arguments in class.

Summary:
The necessary condition for a set of propositions to be considered logically consistent is that each proposition must be logically derived from the others, and in the syllogism 'All mammals are vertebrates; All dogs are mammals; Therefore, all dogs are vertebrates,' the middle term is 'mammals' and its role is as the subject in the major premise and the predicate in the minor premise.

Which of the following best describes a ben- efit of using moods in this context? (a) Moods make the professor seem more authorita- tive and knowledgeable. (b) Moods simplify the arguments by representing them with symbols. (d) All of the above. Assertion (A): 'No man is a mammal’ is a univers negative proposition, illustrating a case where io cal form conflicts with material truth. Reason (R): This statement, while fitting the logic form of a universal negative proposition, is factual incorrect as it asserts there are no individuals w are both 'men' and ‘mammals.’ (a) Both A and R are true, and Ris the correct exp] nation of A. : (b) Both A and R are true, but R is not the corre explanation of A. (c) Ais true, but R is false. (d) Ais false, but R is true. Which of the following statements are mutug inconsistent? 1. Mostly poets are not egoistic. 2. Mostly poets are humble. 3.

Naiyayaikas have explained five members of syl- logism. If we take the example that the hill is fiery because it has smoke, their constituents could be illustrated in the following way: 1. Pratijna: The hill is fiery. (S is P) 2. Hetu: Because it smokes. (S is M) 3. Udaharana: Whatever smokes is fiery, e.g., as is the hearth. (M is P) 4. Upanaya: So like the hearth kitchen, the hill is smoky. (S is M) 5. Nigamana: Therefore, the hill is fiery.

Summary:
Perception in Nyaya philosophy excludes judgments of doubt and is one of the four sources of knowledge along with inference, comparison, and verbal testimony.

TIVE AND DebuUCTIVE 13. (b): we are starting with specific cases such as A, B, C and others. Then we reach to general which says that ‘all humans are mortal’. Therefore, it is inductive in nature. 15. (c): Analytical reasoning is more closely related to deduction, where conclusions are derived from prem- ises based on logical rules and definitions. Inference can. involve both synthetic reasoning (drawing con- clusions based ‘on observed facts and evidence) and analytical reasoning (using logical rules and defini- tions). Inference is a broader concept that encom- passes various types of reasoning. 27. (c): The question draws an analogy between a library and a treasure chest to make a point about the poten- tial value of items in a library. However, the conclu- sion is not necessarily true; it's based on an analogy and does not guarantee the actual presence of valu- able items in a library. 28. (a): This argument is valid because the conclusion ‘I am' logically follows from the premises 'I think’ and 'Thinking things exist.’ The act of thinking itself proves the existence of the thinking entity, which is the self (‘T'). 32, (a): Statement I correctly defines analogical reason- ing and Statement II terming that both argumenta- tive (where analogies are used to make an argument) and nonargumentative (where analogies are used for explanatory or illustrative purposes) uses of analogy. Syttocism Anb Propositions 38. (c): Deductive: It is used to logically draw conclusions from true premises. It doesn't involve any inductive (probabilistic) reasoning. ‘© Formal in the manner that consists of three prop- ositions - two premises and a conclusion. * The major and minor terms which represent the subjects of the premises are distinct and do not overlap. * Traditionally verbalistic but can also be repre- sented symbolically. ¢ Inference essence: That lies in the logical relation- ships between the terms and propositions, not just the specific wording.

Moops Anp Figures 85. (b): Here, the focus is on the actual statements (‘All businessmen are self-confident’ and ‘No self-confi- dent men are religious.’) clarifies the position of the middle term as the predicate in both premises. Here, the middle term is the predicate in both premises. This matches the actual placement of 'self-confident men,' suggesting Figure II as the correct figure. Thus (b) AEE - Il is the correct answer. 87. (c): OAO matches the structure of the given syllogig, with a particular premise, a universal premise, ang particular conclusion. This form can be valid depen, ing on the terms used. CLASSICAL SQUARE OF OPPOSITION 90. (a): ' _ A. All human beings are mortal. B. No human beings are mortal. C. Some human beings are mortal. D. Some human beings are not mortal ‘All human beings are mortal’ (A) and 'Some huma beings are not mortal’ (D) directly contradict eae other. Their truth values are mutually exclusive - one is true, the other must be false. 91. (a): The given question statement is A-type. So, w need to refer Truth Table under square of oppositio; in book. The Level 1 is identified where I is true An E and O are false. So we can match among answe options and get the answer. 92. (a): Propositions diagonally across from each othe in the Square of Opposition are contradictories. The can't be both true or false; if one is true, the othe must be false. By looking at square of opposition, w can say that A and O, and also E and I are contradi tory to each other. 94. (c): The Truth Table (given under square of oppos tion) says that 'some men are cruel is false, there A False, E is True, I is False and O is True. Thus, E and are true as asked in the MCQ. Now identify 1. All me are cruel (I). 2. No men are cruel (E). 3. Some men ar not cruel (O) in the question statement. Thus, afte matching, we can say that 2 and 3 are the answer Thus, (c) 2 and 3 is the correct answer. Alternatively, we can make the question statemen| true.

Summary:
The essence of inference lies in the logical relationships between terms and propositions, not just in the specific wording, as demonstrated through the correct identification of syllogistic figures and propositions in the classical square of opposition.

ar not cruel (O) in the question statement. Thus, afte matching, we can say that 2 and 3 are the answer Thus, (c) 2 and 3 is the correct answer. Alternatively, we can make the question statemen| true. When a statement like 'some men are cruel! false, its negation becomes true. The negation in this case is 'no men are cruel’ that is (E). Again, we ca take the help of Truth Table to get (c) as the answer. 95. (b): Contradictory opposition: This term defines th relationship between two propositions that have th same subject and predicate but differ in both quali (affirmative/negative) and quantity (universal/par- ticular). If one proposition in a contradictory pair 1s true, the other must be false, and vice versa. 96. (d): Two sub-contrary propositions can, both be true but cannot both be false. For example, 'Some cats are. black’ and 'Some cats are not black' are sub-contrary. These statements could both be true if there are black cats and non-black cats. However, if there are no ca’ at all, both statements must be false. 97. (a): The question statement is 'no politician is dishon” est’ that is (E) and given to be false. Now check this with shortcut Truth Table under square of oppositio® === Page 21 === in the book - Level 3. In the statement 'some politi- cians are dishonest’ (I) is mentioned as True. Thus, (a) is the answer. (a): The truth of statement A implies the truth of state- ment B, but not conversely. A is a universal affirmative statement — which asserts that all members of a class (plastic) have a certain property (synthetic). B is a particular affirmative statement, which asserts that some members of a class (plastic) have a certain property (synthetic). If B is true then A may not be true. It means that if some plastic are synthetic, it does not follow that all plastic are synthetic. There may be some plastic that are not synthetic. Note: see the definition of converse. 1, (c): The answer is False. The truth value of the other contrary is false if one of them is true. This is because contraries are two universal categorical proposi- tions with the same subject and predicate that are opposed in quality (one is an affirmation and the other a denial).

Summary:
The correct answer is (c) 2 and 3 based on contradictory opposition and sub-contrary propositions.

Title: Common Logical Fallacies

Text:
Fallacy of Composition assumes that what is true of a part must also be true of the whole. For example, ‘All the players on the team are skilled. Therefore, the team as a whole must be skilled’. 125. (b): This argument attacks the character or actions of the opponent. They may be called as a tax cheat which implies that they are not trustworthy. Rather they should address the substance of their views on tax reforms. 129. (c): This shift in size of mouse is actually a fallacy of equivocation. It uses the term ‘animal! in two differ- ent senses: as a general category and as a measure of size (large animal). The meaning changes in the sentences in the question statement. 132. (d): The middle term in this syllogism is 'against gun control.' In both premises, this term appears undistributed (that does not include all members of the category). Thus, the argument doesn't logically guarantee the conclusion. 133. (a): The Structure of the argument: Premise: 'If capital punishment deterred crime, it would be justified. Second Premise: Capital punishment does not deter crime. Conclusion: Therefore, capital punishment is not justified. The word 'if introduces a ‘conditional statement’, which sets up the hypothetical condition for the argument. It tries to create a deterrent effect. instill- ing fear of consequences. The word 'but' introduces acontrary statement, which opposes the conditional statement that capital punishment is not justified. Thus, if and but creates opposite roles. 135. (a): The answer is Fallacy of ignorantiam (Fallacy of Ignorancé). This fallacy occurs when someone believes a claim is true because no one has proven it false, or they believe it's false because no one has proven it true. In this case, the argument claims that since no one has definitively proven that ghosts do not exist, they must be real. This may be flawed as a way of thinking. 137. (a): This fallacy of unestablishment involves making a claim based on insufficient or unreliable evidence. It is also known as hasty generalization or jumping to conclusions. In the question, the visit by mother is based on a single observation. We don't consider other possible explanations. 138.

Summary:
Various fallacies such as Fallacy of Composition, ad hominem attacks, equivocation, undistributed middle term, conditional statements, fallacy of ignorance, and hasty generalization are discussed in the text as examples of flawed reasoning.

Here, the invisibility of sound is used as a reason for its imper- manence, but being invisible impermanent does make a thing impermanent. === Page 22 === Indian logic (such as Navya-Nyaya) places a strong emphasis on the logical relationship between the reason (hetu) and the conclusion (sadhya). Uses or LANGUAGE 146. (d): A stipulative definition assigns a new or specific meaning to a word or phrase for a particular purpose or context. (a) Persuasive: This aims to influence the attitude or emotion of the audience towards the term or concept being defined2. It often uses emotive or evaluative language to convey a positive or nega- tive connotation. (b) Precising: This tries to reduce the vagueness or ambiguity of a term by providing more specific criteria or boundaries for its application. (c) Lexical: This describes the existing or common usage of a term as it is found in a language or a dictionary. 155. (a): A tautology is a statement that is true in every possible interpretation of its terms12. Statement 1 is a tautology because it is an example of the law of identity, which states that anything is identical to itself3. A wooden table is a table by defi- nition, so this statement is always true. Statement 2 is a tautology because it is an example of the law of excluded middle, which states that any proposition is either true or false. Now, it is either raining or not raining, so this statement is always true. 156.(d): The statement is a prejudice, because it is a negative and unjustified attitude towards a group of people based on their language or culture.

Summary:
The passage discusses various logical fallacies, definitions of terms, and examples of tautologies and prejudices.

or not raining, so this statement is always true. 156.(d): The statement is a prejudice, because it is a negative and unjustified attitude towards a group of people based on their language or culture. Now look the implication - learning a foreign lan- guage makes one less loyal or less devoted to one’s own nation, which matches with the definition of prejudice. 158. (c): The statement ‘X loves Y’ does not necessarily imply that ‘Y loves X’. It could be true, but it’s not a guaranteed inference. 159. (c): Honesty promotes trust and fairness, which are essential for maintaining social cohesion. But there can be all the answers to this subjective question. 163. (b): The WTO recognizes that we live in an increas- ingly globalized, interconnected world where knowledge and intellectual property are significant drivers of economic growth. 169. (a): Friendship is not always transitive — if Anil is a friend of Bob and Bob is a friend of Raj, it doesn’t automatically mean that Anil is a friend of Raj. LOGICALLY EQUIVALENT STATEMENTS 185. (d): ‘Some plants are insect eaters’ is a particular _ affirmative proposition (I). The most direct in a con- cise form is given by (d). 186. (b): We again need to remember that logically equiy. alent means that both statements have same truth, value (either both true or both false). We neeq to look at the combined table of converse, obverse and contraposition. The original statement is A- proposition, its obverse gives (b) as the correct answer. 189. (b): This question is again direct. The double nega. tion in B gives us the Statement B. So, (b) is the answer. 190. (c): MCQs up to 200 are of this nature. This should be solved with diagram Venn diagram. Keep in mind that any doubt is actually false. Thus, (a), (b) and (d) are doubtful, and thus have false value. (c) is the correct answer. PRACTICAL PROBLEMS 191. (d): Step I: First, we check that there are three terms, tables, and teak. Here, table is the middle term, Then, we see whether it is in the form: A to B and B to C, It is not; so alignment is required. For align. ment, we just need to change the order in this case. After alignment: : All teak are tables. Some tables are golden.

Summary:
Various logical statements and reasoning examples are discussed, including prejudice, transitive relationships, honesty promoting trust, and logically equivalent statements, with practical problems and solutions provided.

Step II: This is ‘A+’. (Please refer to ‘syllogism rule. table)’. No conclusion can be drawn. So, option (d) is the answer. Venn diagram solution: Conclusion I: Some teak may or may not be golden. : There is ambiguity. Conclusion I does not follow. Conclusion I: Similarly, some golden may or may not be teak. As there is ambiguity in both cases, none follows: Thus, option (d) is the answer. 192. (c): There are three terms. No alignment is required as it is in the standard format. A +A=A. The conclusion is ‘all boys are fathers’ Conclusion II follows. By applying immediate reference to (converting) — statement I, we can say that some men are boys. Conclusion I also follows. Both I and II follows. Venn diagram solution: Father === Page 23 === 3, (d): There are three terms—poets, inspiring, and : artists. All poets (A) are inspiring (B). All artists (C) are inspiring (B). AtoB. CtoB. So alignment is required as it should be in the form AtoBandBtoC. After converting second statement. All poets are inspiring (A type). Some inspiring persons are artists (I type). It contra- dicts second conclusion also. A+1=No conclusion. So, option (d) is the answer. Venn diagram solution: Inspiring 194. (d): If we look at conclusions directly, the term ‘male teacher’ in the first conclusion and‘women teachers’ and ‘present’ in the second conclusion are not men- tioned in the statements. So, option (d) is the answer. Here, it is important to mention the syllogism propositions—the opposite of ‘absent’ is not ‘present’. 195.(c): This is a comprehensive question, covering all major aspects of syllogism. Please look at the solu- tion carefully. We need to bring the statements to their logical form before checking them for alignment. All those eligible for the post are graduates. Some rickshaw-pullers are graduates. There are three terms—eligible, graduates, and rickshaw-pullers. ‘Graduates’ is the common term. The statements are not in the form: A to B and A to B.

Summary:
Alignment is required in syllogism statements to draw conclusions, and changing the order of the terms can help determine if conclusions follow or not.

According to IEA, second statement should be given priority for conversion: ‘Some graduates are rickshaw-pullers’. Now the statements are to be brought to A to B and B to C form. ‘All those eligible for the post are graduates’ (A-type) ‘Some graduates are rickshaw-pullers’ (I-type) A+I1=No conclusion. 196. (c): Students can try to solve this question with help of Venn diagram. 197.(d): The opposites of ‘passed’ and ‘girls’ are not ‘failed’ and ‘boys’. Failed and boys are not mentioned in the statements. So, no conclusion is valid. 198.(d): The logical form of ‘Most of Indian states existed before independence’ is ‘Some Indian states existed before independence’. It is same as conclu- sion J. Statement and conclusion cannot be the same. Conclusion II is also not implied. So, (d) is the answer. 199. (a): After converting statement I, we can say that ‘a’ is true. ‘On time’ does not mean ‘not late’ in case of propositions. Thus, options (c) and (d) are also not converse of (a). 200. (b): ‘Most teachers are hardworking’ is ‘Some teachers are hardworking’ in its logical form. Both statement and conclusion cannot be the same. So conclusion | is not implied. However, conclusion II ‘Some teachers are not hardworking’ is complimentary of I, so only II is implied. Thus, option (b) is the answer. === Page 24 === === Page 25 === ; LEARNING ees & Fl : aos : : / a Co , | OBJECTIVES { S i | (Bar chart, Histograms, _ _ - : _ Pie chart, Table chart and === Page 26 === Data Interpretation 5 Data interpretation is one of the easiest chapters of NET Paper 1.

phical form by means of an illus- tration, such as graphs, pie charts and so on. Therefore, the act of organizing and interpreting data to get mean- ingful information is known as data interpretation. The important aspects of data sources, their acquisition and interpretation have been covered in Unit II on research aptitude. In this unit, the main focus is on solving practi- cal problems as per questions asked in the NET pattern. Data interpretation needs some mathematical and sta- tistical skills. It needs good knowledge of the concepts of percentage, ratio, proportion, average, etc. The other main input required is to practice a few problems. Familiarity with graphical representation of data, such as Venn diagrams, graphs, pie charts, histogram and poly- gon, is helpful. Once the data is grasped well, questions based on tables and graphs take little time. Sometimes, data is presented in more than one table or graph. The aim is to test not only the quantitative skills but also relative, comparative and analytical abilities. While the terms ‘data’ and ‘statistics’ are often used interchangeably, in scholarly research there. is an impor- tant distinction between the two. Data refers to individual pieces of factual information recorded and used for the purpose of analysis. It is the raw information from which statistics are created. Statistics are the results of data analysis through its interpretation and presentation. Data is usually collected for research purposes, and it is closely related with sampling as well. Data sources, acquisition and classification have been taken care of in the second unit of research. Acquisition basically means collecting data and how it is collected with the help of interviews, questionnaire and so on. Primary and sec- ondary sources, quantitative and qualitative data have also been explained there. raphical Representation Basically, it is a graphic representation of data. It is one of the important ways of analysing numerical data. A graph is a kind of chart through which statistical data is repre- sented in the form of lines or curves drawn across coor- dinated points that are plotted on its surface.

Data interpretation involves organizing and interpreting data through graphical representations such as graphs and pie charts, requiring mathematical and statistical skills, knowledge of concepts like percentage and ratio, and practice with problems, with the aim of testing quantitative, relative, comparative, and analytical abilities.

f analysing numerical data. A graph is a kind of chart through which statistical data is repre- sented in the form of lines or curves drawn across coor- dinated points that are plotted on its surface. Graphs are also easy to understand and are eye catching. They help us to study the cause and effect relationship between two variables, to measure the extent of change in one variable when another variable changes by a certain amount. They enable us to study both the time series and the frequency distribution. They give clear account and pre- cise picture of a problem. GENERAL PrincipLes oF GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION Some basic algebraic principles apply to all types graphic representation of data: gantity “In bal 1. There are two lines called coordinate axes, where the vertical one is known as Y-axis and the horizontal One is called X-axis (Fig. 7.1). : 2. These two lines are perpendicular to each other Where these two lines intersect each other is calleq point ‘O’ or origin. 3. On the X-axis, the distances right of the origin have positive values and the distances left of the origin have negative values. On the Y-axis, distances above the origin have positive values and those below the origin have negative values. (X ~ve, Y+ve) | (X +ve, Y +ve)y (X -ve, Y.-ve) | (X +ve, Y -ve) Figure 7.1. X and Y Coordinates Graphical representation of data may have many for- mats. According to the NTA-NET syllabus, graphic repre- sentation of data has been divided into bar chart, histo- grams, pie chart, table chart and line chart. Here, we are discussing their brief description and some numerical problems. Bar CHart It is also known as a column graph, a bar graph or a bar diagram. It is basically a pictorial representation of data and is shown as rectangles spaced out with equal spaces between them and having equal width. Here, the height (or length) of each bar corresponds to the frequency of a particular observation. We can draw bar graphs both vertically and horizontally depending on whether we take the frequency along the vertical or horizontal axes, respectively. We can take the following example.

Summary:
Graphs are a visual representation of numerical data that help us understand the relationship between variables and can be represented in various formats such as bar charts, histograms, pie charts, table charts, and line charts.

ENTIAL PARTS OF A TABLE atistical table is divided into the following eight parts: Title of the table: A title is a heading at the top of the table describing its contents. It mainly reflects upon the nature of the data, where the data is, what time period the data covers and how the data is classified. Caption: The headings for various columns and rows are called column captions and row captions, respectively. irections: The following table shows the monthly come and various expenditures, of six friends A-F in solute value or in percentage (in terms of monthly March 2023) Friend | MonthlyIncome Incentive.

Incentive Amounts to 15% of salary. All six friends save 40% of their monthly income. There is no expenditure other than those given in the table. Solution: An Important Note: We need to quick look at ques- tions first and see what kind of data may be required. Accordingly, we are starting with friends A — F. This question needs to have lots of calculations. We are put- ting all the information in the table directly. We need to Create special columns for savings and expenditures for the given MCQs. Friend A: Incentive = 15% of Salary = 15 / 100 «0 92000 3. Box head: The portion of the table containing the col- umn caption is called the box head. 4. Stub: The portion of the table containing row caption is called stub. 5. Body of the table: The body of the table contains the statistical data that has to be presented in different rows and columns. : 6. Prefatory notes or head notes: Prefatory notes appear between the title and the body of the table and are enclosed in brackets. They may throw some light on the units of measurements. 7.

They are popularly called pie charts. Circle graphs usually give the percentage that each sector receives. In such representation, the total quantity in question is distributed over a total angle of 360°. While using pie chart to find the ratios of various sectors, there is no need to find the amounts each sector received and then the ratio of the amounts. Find the ratio of the percentages, which is much easier. If some percentage figure is to be converted into degrees of angles extended at the centre, then multiply it by 3.6. For example, if some category is 20%, in degrees equivalent, it is 72°, that is, (20 x 3.6). Conversely, if degree data is to be converted into per cent figure, then divide it by 3.6..

Summary:
The average number of vehicles manufactured by Company X is 1,17,166, with the maximum difference between the productions of Companies X and Y in 2010, where Company Y's production was approximately 164% of Company X's production in the same year.
