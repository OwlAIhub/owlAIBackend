There were social and economic changes, with focus on ethics and morality. There was need to address the issues of broader population. Further, they were sup- ported by royal patronage from Emperor Ashoka. We owe a lot to Indians who taught us how to count with- out which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have made. — Albert Einstein ¢ There were ancient systems of education in Egypt, China, Greece, Mesopotamia and other parts of the world. China was popular for Confucian system of teachings. There were many common points and distinctions. Indian Ancient system made significant contributions in fields like mathematics (concept of zero, decimal system), medicine (Ayurveda), astron- omy, and linguistics (Sanskrit grammar), There was focus on hoilistic development, ethics and morality. We may try to have a grasp of certain facts. © Ancient Indian education, starting around 5000 years ago with the Vedas, significantly shaped Indian cul- ture. This system was more than just basic learning; it promoted deep understanding and spiritual insight. * Vedic education was essentially secular and included extensive teachings in science and arts. It was holistic, integrating the development of the mind, body, and spirit. * Over time, Buddhism and Jainism emerged in India, leading to the establishment of globally renowned universities like Nalanda and Vikramshila. This era marked India as JagatGurw’ (says — Global Mentor), drawing students from various regions to its centers of learning. There is mention of Jagat Guru in National Education Policy - 2020 as well. ° In ancient India, diverse ideas and learning methods coexisted, with people contemplating them in differ- ent ways. This education system was equitable, treat- ing all knowledge areas with equal importance. © Inthis unit, we will take a full view of education, start- ing from ancient education to modern education. EVOLUTION OF ANCIENT EDUCATION The term ‘Veda’ (4) originates from ‘Vid’ meaning ‘knowledge.’ Vedas symbolize boundless knowledge and are regarded as limitless.

ancient education to modern education. EVOLUTION OF ANCIENT EDUCATION The term ‘Veda’ (4) originates from ‘Vid’ meaning ‘knowledge.’ Vedas symbolize boundless knowledge and are regarded as limitless. Ancient Indian education was shaped by religious, political, and economic influences. In ancient Indian philosophy, ‘dharma’ (+4) had a wide- ranging meaning, encompassing ideals, practices, and behaviours that define the righteous path. In Unit 6, we touched upon many facts. Vedic Period (1500-500 BcE) ° Vedas and Upanishads (a@ sit safiaa): During this period, the Vedas, ancient India’s oldest religious and philosophical texts, were composed. The Upani- shads, explaining the Vedas’ philosophical ideas, also emerged. * Epic Period (Heretea @ict): This era witnesseg the creation of epic texts like the Ramayana and Mahabharata, which includes the Bhagavad Gita. Tt was also marked by the rise of Jainism and Buddhism and the codification of Manu Smriti. ° Sutra Period (Ga @i1e): This period saw the develop. ment of significant texts like Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras, Gautama’s Nyaya, and the Mimamsa Shastras. ° Rise of Mahayana Buddhism (Herat aheg ent aq Sea): Nagarjuna ( ) played a pivotal role in this era, marking the rise of Mahayana Buddhism. ° Scholastic Period ( wre): This period’s key contributions include Shankaracharya’s (afaraRs) work and the development of the Vedanta philosophy, * Post-900 CE: The rise of Vedantic schools such as Visishtadvaita and Dvaita ( ) charac. terized this period. Two Dimensions of Knowledge: There are following two aspects of knowledge: Para Vidya (aa faeir): Para Vidya in education is about attaining higher knowledge and spiritual wisdom. Its supreme goal is to help individuals realize their union with the Absolute God and recognize the divine essence within themselves. Apara Vidya (stat faa): Apara Vidya, on the other hand, focuses on lower or secular knowledge. It encom- passes the practical and worldly aspects of life, often, referred to as materialistic elements that contribute to a comfortable existence. This includes various secular sci- ences and disciplines.

Summary:
Ancient education in India was influenced by religious, political, and economic factors, leading to the development of texts such as the Vedas, Upanishads, and epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata, with a focus on both spiritual wisdom (Para Vidya) and secular knowledge (Apara Vidya) throughout different historical periods.

om- passes the practical and worldly aspects of life, often, referred to as materialistic elements that contribute to a comfortable existence. This includes various secular sci- ences and disciplines. , OsBseEctives OF EDUCATION IN ANCIENT INDIA The ultimate objectives were ‘self-realization’ and achiev: ing moksha (+a - salvation of life) so that one gets free- dom from the cycle of death and rebirth. For that, gaining deep knowledge is essential. 1. Gaining Knowledge: Students aimed to gain a wide range of knowledge. 2. Understanding Duties: Education included learning about social and religious responsibilities. 3. Building Character: A key goal was to develop good character traits. 4. Self-Realization and Moksha (at): The ultimate aim was self-realization and achieving moksha, meaning freedom (liberation) from the cycle of birth and rebirth in this world. 5. Personal Development: Education focused on devel- oping the individual’s personality, considering both inner qualities and external behaviours. 6. Inner Progression: It was seen as a journey towards self-fulfillment. 7. Teaching Techniques: Teachers used specific meth- ods to help students understand concepts. 8. Mental Training: Education involved training the mind to enhance creativity. 9. Mind Over Subject: More emphasis was placed on developing the mind than on the subjects studied. Epucat In India categori on the 1 their co: 1. Shr === Page 7 === _ societal Responsibility: Students learned to devote ” themselves to the greater good of humanity. - Chitta Vritti Nirodh (fara gfa Friter): This concept "involves controlling mental activities related to the material world. Importance of Action (karma - #4): The doctrine of » action was significant. vocational Training: There were 64 different arts and professions taught. Training was hands-on under a master, often with free boarding. ‘Rta’ GRA) in Education: This term meant natural and moral order in the Vedic context. Curriculum Design: The design of what to teach was crucial. Oral Learning: Initially, knowledge was passed down orally. Later, texts and a broader range of subjects were included. 17.

Summary:
Ancient Indian education focused on gaining knowledge, understanding duties, building character, achieving self-realization and moksha, personal development, inner progression, teaching techniques, mental training, societal responsibility, controlling mental activities, importance of action, vocational training, the concept of 'Rta' in education, curriculum design, and oral learning.

Title: Ancient Indian Education: Shruti and Smriti Texts, Curriculum Design, and Transmission Methods

Text:
e Vedic context. Curriculum Design: The design of what to teach was crucial. Oral Learning: Initially, knowledge was passed down orally. Later, texts and a broader range of subjects were included. 17. Practical World Knowledge: Students learned about the world and society, aiming to experience the Supreme Truth themselves. Renunciation of Materialism: Acquiring education often meant giving up material wealth and comforts. .Gurukulas and Ashrams (east ait ssa): Students stayed in these educational institutions, often in tough conditions near rivers or lakes. 20. Application of Knowledge: The aim was to use skills and knowledge for personal growth and societal benefit. EpucaTioN THOUGH Mopes oF TRANSMISSION In Indian scriptures, texts are broadly classified into two tegories: Shruti and Smriti. This classification is based on the method of their transmission and the nature of their composition. 1. Shruti( aqfet): This can be simplified as revealed texts, that is what is being divinely heard. ° The Four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva) and the 108 Upanishads fall under the Shruti category. ° Shruti texts are regarded as the core scriptures of vedantic system, they hold the highest authority. They are believed to be the timeless and eternal knowledge revealed to ancient sages (Rishis). Smriti (zafa): This may be termed as remembered texts. These texts are considered to be authored by sages based on their understanding and interpreta- tion of Shruti. ® This category includes a wide range of texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, the 18 Puranas, Kautilya’s Arthashastra, Vatsyayana’s Kama Sutra, various Tantras, and many more. ° They provide more practical and detailed elabo- rations on the philosophical principles found in Shruti. They include laws, rituals, ethical codes, and narratives that guide the social and religious practices of Vedic system. EpucaTION Process In ancient India, the education process was well-struc- tured and consisted of several important stages 1. Vidyarambha (faamest): The education began at the age of 5. This stage marked the initiation of formal learning. 2.

Summary:
In the Vedic context, education focused on curriculum design, oral learning, practical world knowledge, renunciation of materialism, staying in Gurukulas and Ashrams, application of knowledge, and the classification of texts into Shruti and Smriti categories based on their transmission methods.

Title: Stages of Education in Ancient India

Text:
education process was well-struc- tured and consisted of several important stages 1. Vidyarambha (faamest): The education began at the age of 5. This stage marked the initiation of formal learning. 2. Upanayana (Seat): This was the formal education ceremony, also known as the sacred thread ceremony. e In the Guru’s home, the learner experienced a second birth, becoming a ‘Dvija’ (iss), which means ‘twice-born’. e The first birth is from the biological parents, and the second is from the spiritual master and Vedic knowledge. ° This stage typically started between the ages of 8 and 12. During this phase, the student was called a ‘Brahmacharin’ ( ), denoting a period of celibacy and study. ° After completing their education, a Brahmacharin could become a ‘Grihasta’ (TERI), or householder. e ‘Brahm Sangh’ (#é Wt) was an opportunity for students to acquire higher knowledge. The timing of this ceremony varied among castes. 3. Study in Gurukul ( ): The students typically studied in the Gurukul for about 12 years. e After this period, they were allowed to return home, and the Guru provided them with final instructions. e The completion of this phase was marked by the ‘Samavartan Sanskar’ ( GER), a ritual signifying the end of formal education. 4. Fees and Gurudakshina (aTeaferom): There was hardly any interference by ruling class in the payment of fees. e The concept of ‘dignity of labour’ was encouraged, with students often working hard in various tasks. e At the end of their education, students offered ‘surudakshina’, a token of gratitude or acknowl- edgment to their teacher. As per another perspective, the educational process involved three basic stages: 1. Sravana (3Ta&01): This refers to acquiring knowledge by listening, especially to the ‘shrutis’. 2. Manana (14): The students reflected on and ana- lyzed what they had learned, assimilating the lessons and drawing their own inferences. 3. Nididhyasana (fafgeare ): This stage involved com- prehending the truth and applying it in real life, a kind of reflective stage. Susvects in Vepic EpucaTion 1. Itihas (staere): History. 2.

Summary:
The education process in ancient India was well-structured and consisted of several important stages, including Vidyarambha, Upanayana, study in Gurukul, and the payment of fees and Gurudakshina, with a focus on acquiring knowledge through listening, reflection, and application in real life.

This period saw the institutional- ization of rituals, leading to two key developments: G@) The emergence of gods with distinct powers. (ii) The rise of a specialized priestly class (that might have cause estrange among common people). Stages of Vedic Education * Early Learning: Initially, education focused on memorizing sacred texts like the Vedas and dharamshastras (T4311). * Advanced Learning: Later, the curriculum expanded to include grammar, logic, metaphys- ics, and other allied subjects, emphasizing criti- cal thinking (faa4 -‘chintan’) and intellectual development. Components and Focus of Vedic Education: (i) Encompassed teachings from _ sutras Brahmanism. (ii) The primary focus was on the mind, with oral teaching and mental exploration being key methods. , (iii) The Brahman Sangh played a crucial role, provid- ing meritorious students the opportunity to deive deeper into intellectual pursuits. , (iv) Figures like Lord Buddha employed storytell- ing to effectively convey complex teachings and principles. === Page 9 === lelve rtell- Women in households often learned music, dancing etc. which were key cultural skills of the time. » From Rituals to Knowledge: Ancient Indian edu- cation evolved from the Brahmanas ( iS - ritual- focused) to the Upanishads (aM #1 - knowledge- focused), transitioning from ritual practices to seeking deeper understanding. « Aranyaka Phase: The Aranyaka (SR°4) period was a bridge from the practical Brahmanas to the philo- sophical Upanishads. It marked a shift from societal roles to contemplative life, often in forests, for the elderly. ¢ Forest Retirement: Elderly retiring to forests symbol- ized a journey back to roots and a quest for wisdom, representing a spiritual and philosophical exploration beyond mere physical relocation. 1.

Types of Educated Women: * Sadyodwahas ): These women pursued studies until marriage, after which their formal education typically concluded. ° Brahmavadinis (a@atfeit): In contrast to Sadyodwahas, Brahmavadinis chose not to marry, dedicating their lives to ongoing education and scholarly endeavors. Women studied the Vedas and Vedangas, showing their engagement in religious and philosophical education. They often recited hymns necessary for Yajnas (4a) and other ritualistic activities during rituals (178M). We can take prominent examples of _rishikas (aivent) such as Maitreyi (eri) and Gargi (iri), who were esteemed for their wisdom and scholarly contributions. Shift from Vedic System towards Buddhism and Jainism: The Vedas, somehow indirectly influenced the emergence of Buddhism and Jainism in the following manner: There was a reaction to vedic ritualism. 2. The focus shifted towards ethics and morality, though there were changes in vedic philosophy also. There were social and economic changes. 3. There were philosophical differences, they developed their unique doctrines and practices. 4. Buddhism and Jainism appealed to broader popula- tion, there was royal patronage such as by emperors such as Ashoka. 5. Buddhism and Jainism tried to connect with people in common languages. Early Buddhist scriptures, known as the ‘Three Baskets’ (Tripitaka - faften) or Pali Canon, were written in Pali (afc). That was the common language in Bihar and UP where Buddhism originated. Similarly, the early Jain scriptures, includ- ing the Agamas (21774), were written in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit (aeinmeit weed). Jainism later used Sanskrit for accessing Indian philosophy. There are 24 Tirthankaras (atime) in Jainism, the spir- itual leaders who attained enlightenment, are highly revered. Rishabhanatha GessM1%), the first Tirthankara, and Mahavira (Heat), the 24th and final Tirthankara, are particularily esteemed.

the spir- itual leaders who attained enlightenment, are highly revered. Rishabhanatha GessM1%), the first Tirthankara, and Mahavira (Heat), the 24th and final Tirthankara, are particularily esteemed. Jain teachings focus on ethical living Cif sila), spiritual growth (sTeafere faenra), and the welfare of all beings. This philosophy underlines principles like non- violence (stfa), truthfulness (44m), and non-attach- ment (€tFa), guiding followers towards a path of moral and spiritual purity. Basadis (Saal) are Jain tempies or monasteries where devotees and monks perform worship and rituais. ‘Saptabhangi (aefivenyei)’ or “Sapta Puri(aa Ti)’ are the highiy sacred places for Jains such as Ayodhya, Uijain, Mathura, Dwarka, Kashi, Kanchipuram. Jainism mentioned the following: © Dharma (214) is the Jain concept of righteousness and the path to liberation. ° Nirjara (FSRD is the process of purification of the soul. ° Bandha (a) is the attachment of the soul to karma. ° Moksa (ata) is liberation from the cycle of birth and death. © Adharma (3teR4) is the opposite of dharma and leads to bondage. ° Akasha (also spelled as akasa - ST&T9) is the first of the nine primary substances (tattva 77) and is con- sidered to be the fundamental constituent of space. Texts such as Samavaya Sutra (AA at Aas Ya) and Pragnapara Sutra (4a YA) mention various scripts, with the former discussing 64 types and the latter about a dozen. Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsang (aun win - during King Harshvardhana in 7th century) noted that children’s education started with learning alphabets, followed by subjects like grammar, arts and crafts, medicine, logic, and philosophy. The following concepts are important. === Page 10 === 1. Anekantavada (3Mentaate): Termed as ‘non-abso- lutism’, this principle holds that objects have infinite modes of existence, and only Kevalins (enlightened beings) can fully comprehend all knowledge aspects. Syadavada (@leate ): A theory of conditioned predi- cation, suggesting that our perceptions and judgments are conditional and depend on specific situations. 3. Nayavada (~aale): This emphasizes partial view- points, describing reality from various perspectives.

Summary:
Jainism reveres spiritual leaders who attained enlightenment, such as Rishabhanatha and Mahavira, and focuses on ethical living, spiritual growth, and the welfare of all beings through principles like non-violence, truthfulness, and non-attachment, with important concepts including Anekantavada, Syadavada, and Nayavada.

uggesting that our perceptions and judgments are conditional and depend on specific situations. 3. Nayavada (~aale): This emphasizes partial view- points, describing reality from various perspectives. Sevenfold Predication, known as Saptabhangi (aa) in Jainism, is a concept associated with Nayavada. It outlines a unique approach to expressing statements, emphasizing their conditional and relative nature. Saptabhangi illustrates that any statement can be seen from seven different perspectives, each reflect- ing a different aspect of truth. In Jainism, the approach to learning and imparting knowledge encompasses various methods, each serving a specific purpose in the educational process. Here’s how each term fits into this system: 1. Vachana (ater): Reading scriptures or texts is essential in Jain education, focusing on the Agamas and other religious writings. 2. Prachchana (West): This method values asking questions and dialogue, encouraging students to clar- ify doubts and deepen their understanding. 3. Anupreksa (3T{WaIT): It involves reflecting on what has been learned, with critical thinking and self- reflection being key in Jain philosophy. 4. Amhaya (3141): This systematic approach breaks complex subjects into smaller parts for thorough and in-depth understanding. Dharmapalesa (eatery): It entails spreading reli- gious teachings widely, with Jain monks and scholars preaching principles like non-violence and ethical liv- ing. Main Scripture: ‘Agamas’ (31rT4) refers to the sacred texts of Jainism, which contain the teachings and philosophies central to Jainism. Ss aS ee Ge TRANSMISSION [ViopEs In Ancient Epucation These methods remained integral to the educational processes in ancient education. They reflect a holistic approach which combined rote learning with critical thinking, practical application, and interactive learning. 1. Oral Transmission of Knowledge: This method was crucial due to the limited availability of written texts. In Hinduism, the Vedas and other scriptures were tra- ditionally passed down orally. Jainism also relied heav- ily on oral transmission of its scriptures and teachings. 2.

Summary:
Jain education emphasizes the conditional and relative nature of perceptions and judgments, utilizing methods such as reading scriptures, dialogue, reflection, and systematic breakdown of complex subjects for thorough understanding, with an emphasis on spreading religious teachings widely through preaching and the study of sacred texts.

Jainism also relied heav- ily on oral transmission of its scriptures and teachings. 2. Memorization: Memorizing texts and teachings was a foundational method, essential for preserving -knowledge across generations. Critical Analysis and Introspection: The learn? ers acknowledge the importance of teachings (map. tras) in their lives. They try to deeply internalize thi, knowledge, by applying them in their daily actions and decisions. Storytelling: Lord Buddha used this method specifi. cally used to explain His doctrines. That made com. plex ideas more accessible and relatable. This ke method was also used in Hinduism and Jainism fo; conveying moral and ethical lessons. ~ 5. Question and Answer Method: This interactive approach encouraged students to delve deeper into subjects, clarifying doubts and expanding their understanding. 6. Hands-on Method: For practical subjects like medi- cal science, hands-on learning was employed to give students real-world experience and skills. 7. Seminars, Debates, and Discussions: Seminars were used for debates and discussions, promoting critical thinking and the exchange of ideas, they facil- itated intellectual development and mastery of the subjects. Education and Translation Efforts: A significant project involved translating Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit into Tibetan, forming the Tibetan Buddhist philosophy (Kangyur and Tengyur). This project included many nota- ble Indian and Tibetan scholars. Indian Scholars: Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche) Ceniva CTS )): He worked hard to translate texts, helping to establish Buddhism in Tibet. Similar efforts were made by Atisha (3ifagi — 982 — 1054 CE) and Shantarakshita (sazféta), both Indian scholars.

Middle Path and Individual Responsibility: Buddha advocated the ‘Middle Path’ (474 arth, emphasizing personal happiness and responsibility. Begging by dis- ciples aimed to eliminate ego. Democratic Expansion and Monasteries: Buddhism’s democratic principles led to rapid expan- sion, with many monasteries evolving into universi- ties. Bhikkhus (fg) and Bhikkhunis or Upasikas (fargo a saftent) were the main students. , Sangha for Management: Monks were organized into Sanghas (Ht) for better management. The com- munity of monks, nuns, novices, and lay followers is called as Sangha (#1). , Contribution to Art and Architecture: Notable con- tributions include stupas (&{4) at Sanchi, Bharhut, and Gaya. Life-Long Monastic Commitment: Unlike the Vedic system, Buddhist students often remained monks, severing worldly ties permanently. ~. Oral Tradition and Written Teachings: Buddha’s teachings, originally oral, were written in Pali around 25 BCE. Key Texts: Important texts include Divyavadana ), Dipavamsa (etv4e), Mahavamsa (Hetae), Milind Panha (fafere we), etc.

These decisions provide directives for future actions, initiate or retard certain activities, and guide the implementation of prior decisions. Policy, therefore, represents a strategic course of action rather than day-to- day decisions or actions. It is perceived by analysts as a long-term, strategic approach to man- aging and improving education. The given aspects are important. 1. Problem Identification: Recognizing and defining the educational issues or challenges that need to be addressed. 2. Policy Formation: Developing policies to address the identified problems. 3. Decision-Making: Making choices and decisions tar- geting the identified problems. 4, Implementation: Executing the plan or applying the policy in a practical setting. 5.

Sanskrit College in Banaras (Varanasi)(1791): Founded by Jonathan Duncan in 1791, this college focused on the study of Hindu philosophy and law, indicating an interest in traditional Indian learning systems. Fort William College was set up in 1800. 3. Charter Act of 1813: This act marked the first gov- ernment initiative towards education in India, leading to debates about whether education should adhere to’ traditional methods or embrace modernity. 4. Hindu College of Calcutta (1817): Raja Ram Mohan Roy played an important role in the establishment ’ of this prestigious college. This institution was later renamed as Presidency College in 1855 when it was taken over by the British government and made into a government institution. This college was upgraded into Presidency University in 2010. 5.

Lord William Bentick officially ended that Sati practice in Bengal in 1829. Lord Macaulay’s Minutes (1835): Lord Macaulay advocated for educating Indians in English language and literature in 1835, aiming to create a class of English-educated Indians. Introduction of English as Medium of Instruction (1835): Under Lord William Bentinck, the decision to introduce English as the medium of instruction marked the beginning of a significant shift in Indian education, particularly targeting the upper and mid- dle classes with the ‘Infiltration Theory’. Infiltration Theory: This was basically a ‘trickle down’. Western education and values would gradu- ally spread from an initially loyal elite class to the wider population, serving both administrative con- venience and cultural influence. The British wanted that their ‘White Man’s Burden’ (a phrase coined by Rudyard Kipling) to dominate the Indian masses, so that their rule is long term. We may add social -cul- ture dominance to this. Charles Trevelyan, a British official, believed Indian education should include both local and Western elements. To him education should be inclusive, so local culture and literature were important. He pre- sented these ideas in his his 1838 publication, ‘On the Education of the People of India.’ .Founding of Elphinstone College and Calcutta Medical College (1835): Elphinstone College was named after Mountstuart Elphinstone, the then Governor of Bombay. Calcutta Medical College was the first institution in Asia for the study of western medicine. Both represent the expansion of English education in India, in liberal arts and medical sciences.

These reforms aimed to improve the quality and governance of higher education. 27. Morley-Minto Reforms (1919): Part of these reforms included the transfer of authority over edu- cation to provincial levels and Indian ministers, under the ‘diarchy’ system. This allowed for more local and Indian involvement in the management of education. 28, Jamia Millia Islamis (1920): This institution was founded as an expression of nationalist aspirations within the Muslim community. It sought to provide a platform for modern education while preserving Islamic culture and identity. 29, Precursor to the 10+2+3 System: The reforms and recommendations during this period set the stage for the eventual adoption of the 10+2+3 system of edu- cation, comprising 10 years of schooling followed by two years of higher secondary education and three years of university education. 30.

Education as a Shared Responsibility of Centre and State: This idea was proposed when India’s Constitu- tion was being written. But the Constituent Assembly, which was making the Constitution, preferred that such issues should be managed by states. Eventually, acompromise was made. While education was mainly === Page 22 === 10.18 a state matter, the Constitution gave some powers to the central government too. 2. India adopted the following changes to a more orga- nized approach, keeping in view the Commission’s work and suggestions: ¢ Entry 63: The central government controls big institutions like the National Library in Kolkata and major universities like BHU, AMU, and Delhi University. e Entry 64: This is about the central government’s role in managing big scientific and technical edu- cation institutions like IITs. ¢ Entry 65: The central government can set up and manage institutions for professional, vocational, or technical training, including science and tech institutions. * Entry 66: The most important one for education quality. It’s about the central government’s job to coordinate and set standards for higher education and research institutions, ensuring they all meet high-quality benchmarks. e Under Entry 66, key regulatory bodies like the UGC, AICTE, National Medical Commission (formerly Medical Council of India as of 2019), Nursing Council, CAR, Pharmacy Council of India, Institute of Architects, Institute of Accountancy, and the Bar Council of India were established. UGC and Grants-in-Aid (1952): In 1952, the Indian gov- ernment decided that the University Grants Commission (UGC) would handle all matters related to grants-in- aid for central universities and other higher education institutions. The UGC was officially launched by Shri Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, then Minister of Education, on December 28, 1953. Formal Establishment of UGC (1956): The UGC was formally established as a statutory body in November 1956 through an Act of Parliament. Its main role is to coordinate, determine, and maintain standards of univer- sity education in India.

HiGHer EDUCATION Higher education is no doubt more important to us as per NTA UGC NET JRF Exam. 1. Flexible Curriculum and Multiple Exit Options: Undergraduate education will have a flexible cur- riculum with options for 3 or 4 years. Students can receive certificates at various stages, such as a Cer- tificate after 1 year, Advanced Diploma after 2 years, Bachelor’s Degree after 3 years, and Bachelor’s with Research after 4 years. , 2. Interdisciplinary Courses: All undergraduate, post- graduate, and PhD level courses will be interdisciplin- ary, and M. Phil courses will be discontinued. 3, Academic Bank of Credits (ABC): A system ABC will be established to facilitate the transfer of credits between courses. Higher Education Commission of India (HECI): | HECI is the future of higher education in India as |] | envisaged by Ministry of Education.

Title: Reforming Higher Education Governance: The Role of HECI

Text:
n umbrella | | body for the functions being carried out by UGC, | AICTE, NCTE to name a few. Later, it was discussed |. | in NEP, 2020. | There will be streamlined and more transparent | | governance. The success depends upon effective | implementation, transparent governance and fund- | ing. There are concerns about the potential for | increased centralization and loss of autonomy for | universities. There are fears that a one-size-fits-all | approach that might not cater to the specific needs | of diverse institutions. | Four Verticals of HECI: HECI will function through technology-driven interventions and have the power to penalize non-conforming institutions. HECI can be thought of as a four-armed octopus, each arm handling a different task: 1. National Higher Education Regulatory Council (NHERC): The rule-maker, NHERC is to set academic standards, approving institu- tions, and monitoring compliance. This will exclude medical and legal education. 2. National Accreditation Council (NAC): This is actually the quality checker. Here, the "meta- accrediting" term accurately reflects its role in overseeing a network of independent accredit- ing bodies. Accreditation wouldn't solely rely on basic norms and self-disclosure. NAC would also consider factors such as good governance, student outcomes, employability, and research output. ‘ 3. National Higher Education Funding Council (NHEFC): NHEFC is responsible for allocating funding to institutions based on. performance and national priorities. This NHEFC is some- times referred as HEGC (Higher Education Grants Council). 4. National Institute for Higher Education Management (NIHEM): The curriculum boss, designing what you learn and setting learning goals. This is responsible for capacity building of faculty and administrators, and providing research and policy support. Phasing Out Affiliation System: The affiliation of colleges will be phased out in 15 years, with graded autonomy granted to colleges. 5. Increase in Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER): GER in higher education will be taised to 50% by 2035, with the addition of 3.5 crore seats. The current GER is 26.3%. 6.

Summary:
The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) will oversee various functions of UGC, AICTE, NCTE, and others, with concerns about centralization and loss of autonomy for universities, and will operate through four verticals including a regulatory council, accreditation council, funding council, and institute for higher education management, aiming to increase Gross Enrollment Ratio to 50% by 2035.

Deemed-To-be Universities A ‘deemed-to-be university,’ also commonly referred to as a ‘deemed university,’ is an institution recognized for its exceptional performance, officially designated by the cen- tral government under Section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956. Deemed universities can only attain approval through an executive order following a recommendation from the UGC. Although they possess all the powers of a typical university, they lack the authority to affiliate colleges. Historical Instances: The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru and the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in Delhi were among the pioneering institutions to be conferred with deemed status. The IISc achieved this status in 1958, despite its establishment in 1908. Additionally, the Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) became the first private institution to attain deemed university status in 1976. Main Examples: Notable examples of deemed-to-be -universities include: ° National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), located in New Delhi. e Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, based in New Delhi. e Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, situated in New Delhi. ° Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, located in Tirupati. === Page 34 === 10.30 ¢ National Dairy Research Institute, situated in Karnal. ° Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, situated in Mumbai.

The private IOE can also come up as greenfield ventures, provided that the sponsoring organisation submits a con- vincing perspective plan for 15 years. Private institutions will not get any financial support, but they will be entitled for more autonomy as a special category Deemed University. The greenfield institutions would get a period of 3 years to establish and operationalize the institution. The UGC has nominated 20 institutions (10 public and 10 private institutions) for IOE in August 2019. The initial rankings have 15 institutions each from public and private sector.

Title: Promoting Classical Languages and Literature: Ministry of Culture's Proposals

Text:
literature should be distinct from the modern and there may also be a discontinuity between the classical language and its later forms of offshoots. The proposals are made by the Ministry of Culture. Once a language is declared classical, it gets finan- cial assistance for setting up a centre of excellence for the study of that language and also opens up an avenue for two major awards for scholars of emi- nence. Besides, the UGC can be requested to create to begin with at least in central universities a certain number of professional chairs for classical languages for scholars of eminence in that language. The fathers of the Constitution conferred Sanskrit special status by Article 351 as it was the primary source language for many languages including Hindi. Five languages in the world, namely, Chinese, Sanskrit, Arabic, Greek and Latin, have been assigned the status of classical languages. Implications: e Autonomy: Institutes with IOE tag will be given greater autonomy and freedom to decide fees, course durations and governance structures to enable them to vault of the top global institutions. They would be able to admit for- eign students and recruit faculty from abroad. ° Grant: The public institutions under IOE tag will receive a government grant of 71000 crore, while the private institutions will not get any funding under the scheme. 1. Which of the following statements applies in the con. text of institutions selected as Institute of Eminence? 1. The institute enjoys complete academic and administrative autonomy. : 2.

Open anp Distance Learning (ODL) ODL in India, as outlined by the Ministry of Education plays a pivotal role in expanding the reach and accessibil- ity of education. The key points are as follows: 1. Nature and Objectives of ODL: ODL is a part of non-conventional education where physical presence of teachers and learners at the same place and time is not necessary. It offers flexibility in teaching and learning methods, timings, and admission criteria, while maintaining quality standards. The primary goals include democratizing higher edu- cation, providing innovative university-level educa- tion, offering opportunities for skill upgradation and | qualifications, and fostering lifelong learning. 2, Philosophy of ODL: Open learning focuses on mini- mizing restrictions to maximize openness in educa- tion. It is an educational philosophy aiming to make learning accessible to more people. Distance education operationalizes the philosophy of open learning. It encompasses all teaching and learn- ing where the learner and the teacher are separated by space and time. 3. Communication’ Methods: The curriculum interac- tion takes place in an interesting manner.

Title: "The Evolution of Professional Education in India"

Text:
nology. The new role for educational institutions found it necessary to redefine its goal mainly related to economic development and to ensure a place for India in the community of prosperous nations. A profession is a vocation founded upon specialized educational training, the purpose of which is to supply counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain. A profession arises when any trade or occupation transforms itself through ‘the development of formal qualifications based on education, apprenticeship, and examinations, the emergence of regulatory bodies with powers to admit and discipline members, and some degree of monopoly rights.’ The need for professional education has only increased with changing needs of society and economy. The professional regulatory. bodies grant approval for establishment of institutes and determine standards for the same. Some of the specialized professional bodies are Medical Council of India, Dental Council of India, Council of Architecture, the details of which are mentioned on page 10.23. Thus, a significant part of the Indian higher education system is regulated. However, there are certain areas that are not. === Page 40 === NEES ES % Technical education imparts knowledge ofa a specific trade, craft or profession. It can meet the increasing demands of expanding society and it is multiplying demands and development. To train our students/professionals in response to the need of the time, our education system must be reor- ganized to give it the necessary practical and technical bias. The Government of India is also very keen for uni- versal recognition of our education-system, and because of that, all universities are trying hard to get the NBA accreditation. We find that in a zeal to cope with the advancement of science and technology, our technical education system has become primarily skill-oriented and almost deficient or casual in the education in human values.

Summary:
Educational institutions in India are redefining their goals to focus on economic development and ensuring a place in the community of prosperous nations, with a shift towards specialized professional education and technical training to meet the changing needs of society and the economy.

at in a zeal to cope with the advancement of science and technology, our technical education system has become primarily skill-oriented and almost deficient or casual in the education in human values. TecunicaL Eoucation Scenario In INDIA In India, technical education covers programmes in engi- neering, technology, management, architecture, town planning, pharmacy, applied arts and crafts, and hotel management and catering technology. 1. The first engineering college was established in Uttar Pradesh in 1847 for training of civil engineers at Roor- kee. It conferred diplomas that were considered to be equivalent to degrees. 2. Three engineering colleges were opened by about 1856 in three presidencies, namely, Calcutta, Bombay and Madras. 3. In Bengal, the leaders of the Swadeshi Movement tried to start many institutions. However, only the College of Engineering and Technology at Jadavpur survived. 4, Many technical courses were started at the University of Banaras with great efforts put by Pandit Madan - Mohan Malviya (1917). 5, Many other courses were also started at the Bengal Engineering College at Shibpur in the 1930s. 6. A number of engineering colleges were established since 15 August 1947. It was due to the realization that India had to become a great industrial country and would require a large number of engineers than could be supplied by the older institutions. Att inoia Counci ror Tecunicat Epucation e 1943: The Technical Education Committee of the CABE was constituted. e 1944: The Sergeant Report was prepared. e 1945: The AICTE was formed. e 1986: As stipulated in the National Policy of Educa- tion (1986), the AICTE was vested with the following: (i) Statutory authority for planning, formulation and maintenance of norms and standards (ii) Quality assurance through accreditation (iii) Funding in priority areas, monitoring and evaluation (iv) Maintaining parity of certification and awards (v) The management of technical education in the country ° 1987: The AICTE was setup.

Summary:
The technical education system in India has become primarily skill-oriented, lacking in education in human values, with a history of establishment and development of engineering colleges and the formation of the AICTE to regulate and improve technical education.

(a) $150 (b) €160 (c) 7180 (d) ¥200 Ans: (c) To calculate the selling price of a single book, we need to total the cost. Let us calculate that first. Transportation cost per book = 15,000/1000 As transportation cost is 10% of total cost, thus %15 = 10% of total cost Total cost of printing a copy = 15 x 100/10 =%150 Now selling price = total cost + profit = 150 + 20% of 150 = 150+ 30 =%180 [J Data Mapping - | ’ Data mapping is the process of mapping data fields from a source file to their related target fields. The accessibility to required data can make some organization more success- ful. Somehow, data is easier to use when it is visualized. Visual data helps people understand how different con- cepts originate and their relation with each other. Data mapping helps in all these. For example, ‘Name’, ‘Email’ and ‘Phone’ fields from an Excel source are mapped to the relevant fields in a delimited file, which is our destination. Data mapping helps by providing organizations with procedure links to show how certain tasks are to be uti- lized.

Summary:
The ratio between printing cost and royalty is 4:3, with the royalty amounting to $245,900, and the combined printing and binding cost for a single copy of the book is $60, the central angle corresponding to the expenditure incurred on royalty is 54°, the difference between promotion and printing cost is $20, and the selling price per book to earn a profit of 20% is $180.

urce are mapped to the relevant fields in a delimited file, which is our destination. Data mapping helps by providing organizations with procedure links to show how certain tasks are to be uti- lized. Forty per cent of our nerve fibres that are linked to the brain are in the retina. Data mapping helps us see what makes different pieces of data useful and helpful. Customer trends can be traced in the real time. The causes of trends and past data numbers can be analysed and other calculations of information and variables can be done. We can also use data mapping software to com- pare our date with that of competitors. This should make it easier for your business to grow when chosen right. It also works by establishing larger maps. Sales-force of any organization has a particularly strong data mapping software program that can be put to use. This helps in real time also. We can get connected to a cloud network to get information in real time. , Data mapping works for all businesses. For example if we were in the retail sector, then we can use data man ping to calculate how discount sales can influence the overall sales totals in a business. Similarly, financing and investment decisions can also be made. : Data may be internal or external, but if it is Settin, more dispersed and voluminous, then data leverage is important and actionable insights should be developed. There are arrays of data points to collect information. Their language may be quite different. We can develop separate data models. Data mapping tasks vary in complexity, depending op the hierarchy or disparity between the structure of the source and of the target. Every application, on-premise or on cloud basis, uses metadata to explain data fields. Microsoft SharePoint, InetSoft Style Intelligence and IBM Cognos Business Intelligence help us to review information by generating simple charts and graphs. Depending on the number and schema of the data sources, database mappings can have a varying degree of complexity. In general, data mapping helps with the following activities.

Summary:
Data mapping is a process that links data sources to relevant fields in a delimited file, providing organizations with procedure links to show how tasks are utilized, allowing for real-time analysis of customer trends and comparisons with competitors, and aiding in decision-making for businesses in various sectors by developing actionable insights from dispersed and voluminous data points.

The varying scales include the following: Nominal scale: It consists of non-numeric categories that cannot be ranked or compared quantitatively. variables are exclusive and exhaustive. Ordinal scale: It consists of categories that are exclu- sive and exhaustive but with a logical order. Quality ratings and agreement ratings are examples of ordi- nal scales (i.e. good, very good, fair, etc., or agree, strongly agree, disagree, etc.). ¢ Interval: It is a measurement scale where data is grouped into categories with orderly and equal dis- tances between the categories.

The description is not through numerical values or patterns but through descriptive mtext or text. These techniques include the following rameters: * Observations: Here, behaviour patterns may be the amount of type and time spent in an activity and com- munication used. Documents: Here, different types of documentation resources can be coded and divided based on the type of material they contain.

Qualitative data much open to inter- pretation must be ‘coded’ so as to facilitate the grouping and labelling of data into identifiable themes. Quantitative Data INTERPRETATION The keyword in quantitative is ‘numerical’. It is a set of pro- cesses by which numerical data is analysed. It involves the use of statistical modelling, such as standard deviation, mean and median. Let’s quickly review the most common statistical terms that are as follows: * Mean: A mean represents a numerical average for a set of responses. ® Standard Deviation: It reveals the distribution of the responses around the mean, the degree of con- sistency within the responses and then insight into data sets. * Frequency Distribution: This is a measurement of gauging the rate of a response appearance within a data set. It is extremely keen.in determining the degree of consensus among data points. It entails correlation tests between two or more variables. The different processes can be used together or sepa- rately, and comparisons can be made to ultimately arrive at a conclusion. Other signature interpretation processes of quantitative data include the following: ° Regression analysis * Cohort analysis ° Predictive and prescriptive analysis imPORTANCE OF Data INTERPRETATION The purpose of collection and interpretation is to acquire useful and usable information and to make the most informed decisions possible. Data interpretation includes the following characteristics: ®° Data identification and explanation ° Comparing and contrasting of data ° Identification of data outliers ° Future predictions There are some common issues with data interpretation: 1. Informed Decision Making: Data analysis should include identification, thesis development and data collection followed by data communication. 2. Anticipating needs with Trends Identification: Data insights provide knowledge, and knowledge is power.

Cost Efficiency: Proper implementation of data anal- ysis processes can provide businesses with profound cost advantages within their industries. 4. Clear Foresight: Companies that collect and analyse their data gain better knowledge about themselves, their processes and performance. In addition, there are certain problems with data inter- pretation. === Page 4 === It is usually said that ‘big data equals big trouble’ where some ‘pitfalls’ do exist and can occur when analysing data, especially at the speed of thought. Let’s identify three of the most common data misinterpretation risks and shed some light on how they can be avoided: 1. Correlation mistaken for causation: It is the tendency of data analysts to mix the cause of a phenomenon with its correlation. When two actions occurred together, one caused the other. This is not accurate as actions can occur together. The remedy is to attempt to eliminate the variable you believe to be causing the phenomenon. 2. Confirmation Bias: It occurs when we havea theory or hypothesis in mind, but are intent on discover- ing only data patterns that provide support, while rejecting those that do not. This pitfall is often based on subjective desires. Thus, always remem- ber to try to disprove a hypothesis rather than try to prove it. 3. Irrelevant Data: As large data is no longer centrally stored and as it continues to be analysed at the speed of thought, it is inevitable that analysts will focus on data that is irrelevant to the problem they are trying to correct. The remedy is to proactively and clearly frame any data analysis variables and key performance indicators prior to engaging in a data review. Keeping in view all these aspects, we need to be careful about the following factors: 1. Collect your data and make it as clean as possible. 2. We need to be careful about the type of analysis to perform, be it qualitative or quantitative, and apply the methods, respectively, to each.

Summary:
Data analysis involves identification, thesis development, and data collection, leading to data communication, with potential pitfalls including mistaking correlation for causation, confirmation bias, and focusing on irrelevant data, requiring careful consideration of data cleanliness and appropriate analysis methods.

ty at a low cost, promoting equality in education. LIMITATIONS oF ICT 1. High Infrastructure and Start-up Costs: Building and maintaining ICT systems, including hardware and soft- ware, can be costly. That requires lots of skills, but this may come down as there is laot of competition in the mar- ket now to provide updated technologies at a lower price. To deal with Individual Differences for Economies of Scale: To reduce costs, identical content may be delivered to all learners, potentially overlooking the diverse learning needs of individuals and creating a digital divide. 3. Accessibility Challenges: Factors such as timing, electricity supply, socio-cultural aspects, poverty, illit- eracy, time constraints, mobility, and relevance can impede accessibility. 4. ICT Primarily as a Delivery System: ICT serves as a content delivery tool rather than initiating significant attitudinal or behavioural changes. 5. Difficulty in Performance Evaluation: Assessing performance takes time due to the multidimensional and long-term nature of ICT-based learning. 6. Ongoing Training Requirements: As technologies evolve, trainers require continuous training, which may face resistance. 7. Call for an Attitudinal Shift in Teaching and Learning: There are psychological and social effects of online digital education, perception of parents, pupil teacher ratio to deal with. ICT primarily serves as a communication tool, potentially increasing transactional distance and raising concerns about plagiarism.

Computer hardware, with its diverse components, forms the bedrock of digital technology, enabling the creation, manipulation, and storage of electronic data while bridging the physical and digital realms. Memory — The Com : Computer storage, often referred to as memory, encom- passes the components and recording media that retain digital data. The term ‘memory’ typically refers to both temporary internal storage areas within a computer and the physical chips capable of holding data. In some cases, computers utilize virtual memory, extending their physi- cal memory onto a hard drive. Bytes internal Memory Volatile kB/MB Faster access GB / Main Memory (RAM) Primary Higher (ORAM) Mernory capacity and a economical GB USB/Fiash Memory (EEPROM) Secondary TB Storage Magnetic Disk/Hard Disk Non-volatile Terti PB/ / Magnetic Tapes/Tape drives storage Figure 8.3. Memory Hierarchy === Page 32 === Memory Types AND FUNCTIONS Computer memory comes in various types, each striking a balance between speed and cost: Cache Memory: Cache memory is high speed volatile memory that is located closest to the CPU. When the CPU requests data from RAM, it checks the cache memory first for faster access. Cache memory is designed to bridge the speed gap between the CPU and main memory (RAM). SRAM is typically used for small caches, so we need to look at the following aspects for detailed idea: * Cache memory is closely associated with SRAM (Static Random Access Memory). * SRAM employs flip-flops to store data bits. ° Flip-flops are bistable circuits, Which are the most fundamental that is capable of maintaining either a 0 or 1 state.

Summary:
Input devices such as keyboards and microphones input data into a computer system, while output devices like monitors and printers present processed information, with computer memory encompassing components that retain digital data and come in various types balancing speed and cost.

AM (Static Random Access Memory). * SRAM employs flip-flops to store data bits. ° Flip-flops are bistable circuits, Which are the most fundamental that is capable of maintaining either a 0 or 1 state. ® SRAM?’s fast data access is attributed to its ability to access data without refreshing memory cells. * Cache memory is divided into three levels: L1, L2, and L3. ¢ 1 cache is the smallest and fastest cache mem- ory that has a size of few kilobytes. L1 is located on CPU or closest to CPU, L1 matters the most for the speed of computer. L1 reduces the time it takes for the CPU to fetch data from main mem- ory. The main memory is located on a separate chip that is slower than cache memory. * L2cacheis positioned on a separate chip between L1 cache and main memory. This acts as a buffer for less frequently accessed data. The size may be tens of kilobytes that is larger than that of L1. To put this scene further, we can say that L2 cache acts as a bridge between the L1 cache, which is the fastest and smallest cache, and main mem- ory, which is the largest and slowest memory. * L3 cache: This cache is located on a separate chip, it is megabytes or more in size. The speed is less than L2. L3 is least expensive. The basic of L3 may be SRAM or DRAM.

l charge. — FLow of Dara Amonc Memory Devices e following discussion helps the learners in the better derstanding of the memory storage devices so that we ve the absolute clarity of the data movement. This has en discussed separately with data flow motives only: Central Processing Unit: Consider CPU as the city cen- tre, the hub of all major activities and decision-making, _akin to the administrative headquarters of a city. Registers: These are like immediate, small offices _inside the CPU where swift data processing occurs, closest to the city centre for rapid information access. Cache and SRAM (Static RAM): The cache, sup- ported by SRAM for its speed, is comparable to local, fast-access storage facilities near the city centre (CPU). They store data the CPU is likely to need soon, offering quicker access than distant warehouses. Bus: The bus system is the city’s transportation net- work, connecting different parts like the CPU, RAM, and storage devices. It facilitates data movement within the computer, akin to roads in a city. A wider bus (higher bandwidth) means more data can travel at once, just as broader roads allow for more traffic. RAM: RAM is like the city’s warehouses, storing more data than caches or registers but with slower access. It’s where active data (current applications and files) is kept for quick retrieval by the CPU. » ROM: Think of ROM as a museum or archive, hold- ing crucial, unchangeable system data necessary for boot-up and basic functioning, akin to the basic instructions for starting the computer. Hard Drive/Storage: These represent the city’s long- term storage units or warehouses located on the out- skirts, used for storing data that isn’t immediately needed but is important for long-term retention. nd these instructions cannot be accessed or modified — Note: The above analogy highlights how the cost of each computer component is influenced by its function, speed, and proximity to the CPU (‘city centre’), much like real estate prices vary based on location and facilities in a city. The city centre is the costliest, and most complex due to its central role in processing data. Storage components such as Hard Drives are less expensive.

Summary:
The analogy of a city center is used to explain the flow of data among memory devices, with the CPU as the central hub, registers as immediate processing offices, cache and SRAM as fast-access storage facilities, RAM as warehouses for active data, ROM as a museum holding crucial system data, and hard drives as long-term storage units on the outskirts.

Storage components such as Hard Drives are less expensive. Memory Classification by Volatility Memory can also be classified based on its volatility: Volatile Memory: This temporary memory type only retains data while power is supplied. RAM is a prime example of volatile memory. Non-Volatile Memory: Permanent in nature, this mem- ory type retains data even after the system is powered off. ROM is an instance of non-volatile memory. Storage Devices Categories Computer storage devices are divided into two categories: (i) Internal Storage Devices: These devices are compo- nents located inside a computer. For instance, Hard disks, which are magnetic disks used for storing com- puter data. They typically offer substantial storage capacity and are traditionally known for their speed and performance. (ii) External Storage Devices: Portable storage devices are commonly used for data mobility. Examples are: ° USB flash drives, often called pen drives or mem- ory sticks. e Optical discs like CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs. USB flash drives are small, flat, and resemble a pen in shape. They offer substantial storage capacity and can be easily inserted into any com- puter’s USB socket for data transfer. HDD or SSD - The Storage Technology Choices HDDs and SSDs are storage devices, with SSDs being the newer technological innovation, so we buy systems with SSDs. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) e HDDS are also known as hard drives, are traditional storage devices that have been widely used for decades. e They employ a rotating platter system to store data magnetically. The platter consists of a thin, circular disc coated with a magnetic material. e As the platter spins at high speeds, read/write heads hover close to the surface, reading and modifying the magnetic patterns that represent data. Advantages of HDDs 1. Cost-Effective: HDDs offer a significant cost advan- tage compared to solid-state drives (SSDs). HDDs are much economical and thus attractive in terms of Per gigabyte or terabyte storage. === Page 34 === 2.

Summary:
Computer storage devices can be classified based on location and facilities in a city, with the city centre being the costliest and most complex, while memory can also be categorized by volatility as volatile or non-volatile, and storage devices are divided into internal and external categories such as hard disks and USB flash drives, with the newer technology choice being solid-state drives (SSDs) over traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) due to cost-effectiveness and storage capacity advantages.

Binary Numeer System Formally, we all know that base-10 system is a positiong system. In decimal notation, we write a number as a string o symbols, where each symbol is one of these 10 digits, and to interpret a decimal number, we multiply each digit b the power of 10 associated with that digit’s position. The binary system uses only two symbols, 0 and 1, to represent values. Computers are built from transistors and an individua transistor can only be ON or OFF (two options). Thus, the values in a binary system, such as 0’s and l’s, are called binary digits or bits. Computers use base 2 because they can recognize only two values, 1 or 0.

as a ‘repository of resources, for internal users. © Firewall Protection: Intranet is often isolated from the broader internet by firewalls, that again helps in the privacy of internal communication. ° Overcoming Limitations: Intranets address con- straints associated with conventional LANs and WANs. Technological Backbone * Common Technology: Intranets operate on widely adopted technologies which functions with Telnet, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or Gopher, it is the web that predominantly prevails. ° User-Friendly Web Interface: Leveraging the web and its familiar browsers offers a cornfortable and well-known interface for most intranet users. Enabling Technology e Empowering Users: Intranets act as technology enablers, delivering domain-specific resources. ° Authentication Methods: User authentication can occur through server permissions, database-based techniques, firewalls, IP-based verification, or a com- bination of these. ° Key Technologies: Employed technologies encom- pass databases (e.g., Access, SQL Server, MySQL), XML, HTML or XHTML-based forms, and web script- ing (e.g., ASP, PHP, ColdFusion). ° A foundational understanding of computers can be advantageous for users. Core Features of Intranets ° Shared Folders: A fundamental intranet often com- prises shared folders linked to the network, their vis- ibility depends upon the user’s permission levels. e The Knowledge Sharing is facilitated through ease of access and use, universal information access for small businesses, person-to-person interaction, and some informal networks. Extranets: Extending the Reach ° Extranets are a similar concept to intranets, but their implementation differs. ° An extranet is also a controlled, private network that extends beyond a company’s internal boundaries, allowing geographically dispersed employees, such as partners, clients, or suppliers, to connect securely. ° Extranets provide authorized users with access to lim- ited resources, enabling secure collaboration with an organization. Network TorpoLocy The network topology plays a critical role in the design and implementation of both intranets and extranets.

Summary:
Intranets are secure internal networks that use common technologies and user-friendly interfaces to provide domain-specific resources and facilitate knowledge sharing, while extranets extend this concept to allow secure collaboration with external partners, clients, or suppliers.

It influences how devices are connected, data flows, and how security and access controls are managed within these private networks, that is mainly the arrangement === Page 40 === of cables, computers, and other peripherals. They play an important role in workstations or nodes within computer systems. The main categories of Network topologies are as follows: 1. Bus Topology: In this configuration, each computer is connected to a central (single) cable, similar to a bus. 2. Star Topology: This topology features a central hub or switch box to which all workstations connect directly. Ring Topology: In a ring topology, each device is con- nected to exactly two neighbouring devices, forming a closed loop. 4. Mesh Topology: Every computer in a mesh topology is connected to every other computer, enabling mes- sages to take multiple paths. 5. Tree Topology: A tree topology is a hybrid structure that combines two or more star networks into a more complex arrangement. 6. Hybrid Topology: This could be a combination of any of the above, showing interconnections between dif- ferent types of topologies, like a star connected to a bus topology. source: https://telecom-hyb. blogspot.com accessed on Nov 12, Computer Virus A computer virus is like a sneaky, bad software program called ‘malware.’ It can harm our computer in different ways. Here’s we can see what they can do: e Harm Data: Viruses can damage or delete your com- puter’s programs and files. e Quick Replication: They’re like speedy copy machines, creating duplicates of themselves. e Widespread Damage: They spread to different areas, harming your computer’s data, even the ‘boot’ section of your hard drive.

Ney types of viruses and malware are continuously being dey, oped by malicious actors. The common types are as follow. File Infector Viruses: These viruses attach themselves tg executable files, such as .exe or .com files. When we ryp an infected program, the virus spreads to other files ang can also propagate to other computers when we share those files. They act surreptitiously, hiding within seey, ingly normal files. 1. Simple Virus: Think of these viruses as sneaky troy. blemakers that focus on program files, like the so ware you use. They spread when you run a specific program. It’s like a hidden surprise inside a gift box, and the surprise isn’t good! 2. Encrypted Virus: Encrypted viruses are like digita| spies. They infect different kinds of files but act just like secret agents, hiding within files to avoid being caught. 3. Polymorphic Virus: These viruses are like ‘shape. shifters’ in a spy movie. They can hide inside files, especially those important executable files. They con- stantly change their appearance to stay hidden, just like secret agents trying to disguise themselves. 4. Bombs: Imagine these viruses as time bombs. They can infect and hide inside specific types of files, and they only go off at a particular time. It’s like a ticking time bomb in your computer! 5. File Infector Virus: This virus is a true secret agent. It directly targets and hides within executable files, like those with extensions .exe or .com. They sneak around like spies in your computer files. : The other types are also given below, although they also function as secret viruses.

ost well- known part of it is the World Wide Web (WWW), which is different from the entire internet. Woartp Wine Wes (WWW) The WWW was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working at CERN. WWW is based on three key technologies: HTML, URL, and HTTP, which are essential for the web as we know it today. The public ver- sion of the WWW started in 1993. CERN In General - CERN is a top European research organization in Geneva, known for high-energy physics research. Notably, they developed the LHC (Large Hadron Collider), the world’s largest particle accelerator. CERN’s work advances our understanding of fundamental par- ticles and physics, including the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson. === Page 4 === Web Browsers We use web browsers to explore the WWW. These are like special tools that help us interact with the internet. They retrieve information from the web and show it to us. Popular examples are Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Safari. Bookmarks Web browsers allow you to bookmark your favourite web- sites, so you can easily revisit them. Domain Name Domain names are the unique names that identify web- sites on the internet. They typically have a suffix like ‘com’ for commercial sites or ‘edu’ for educational ones. 1. .com: Commercial institutions or organization .edu: Educational institutions .gov: Government sites «mil: Military sites net: Gateways and administrative hosts .org: Private organizations China cn India win United Kingdom uk Domain Name Server (DNS): Mapping Domain Names to IP Addresses A DNS server translates domain names (such as google. com) into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (such as 192.168.1.1). IP addresses are the ‘numerical addresses’ that are assigned to all devices connected to the Internet. Thus, DNS servers are essential for navigating the inter- net because they allow our computers to find and com- municate with websites by their human-readable domain names instead of needing to remember numerical IP addresses. How DNS Servers Work? i. When you type a website’s domain name (like www. example.com) into your web browser, your browser asks a DNS server for the IP address linked to that domain.

cal IP addresses. How DNS Servers Work? i. When you type a website’s domain name (like www. example.com) into your web browser, your browser asks a DNS server for the IP address linked to that domain. ¢ The DNS server first checks if it knows the IP address from before (in its cache). If it does, it provides the IP to your browser. e If the DNS server doesn’t have the IP in its cache, it will ask other DNS servers until it finds the correct IP. 2. Once the DNS server gets the right IP address, Yo browser uses it to connect to the web server (whe the website is stored). * Your browser then requests the specific contey, you want from the web server. * The web server sends that content back to you, _browser, which shows it on your screen. Home Page The home page of a website is like the book’s title Page and table of contents. It acts as an index to all the content on the site, similar to how a book’s table of contents listg what’s inside. This page identifies the site and has links to other pages within the website, accessible using a we browser like Microsoft Explorer. Hyperlinks A hyperlink is an element in a web page that facilitates navigation to another web page or to another part of the same web page. Web pages are filled with links, which can be under lined or a different colour. When you click one, it takes you to another part of the same page or a different page. Firewall A firewall is a software program that protects your com- puter from unauthorized access, while connected to the internet. It keeps an eye on the data going to and from your computer and warns you about anything suspicious. Search Engines A search engine is a website that allows you to search for information on the WWW. They look for keywords in doc- uments and show you a list of pages where those words are found. Some popular search engines include Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Meta Search Engines peg Meta Search Engines save time by searching multiple Bt search engines at once. It is like a search tool that asks C.c many other search engines for help.

ed orders. 4. Privacy: Protecting user identity. » Safety: Ensuring security when providing credit card information online. NMiosite Apps Mobile apps simplify tasks with a simple click for most users. To tech-savvy individuals, they are software appli- cations designed to run on mobile devices like iPhones, smartphones, and tablets. Apps are broadly classified into two categories: 1. Web Apps: These apps are accessed through a web browser over the internet, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. They are functional, interactive, and don’t require downloads. Web apps use standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They can run on any device with a web browser, regardless of the operating system. 2. Mobile Apps: Mobile apps can be divided into two types: ° Native Apps: These apps are specifically designed for particular platforms like iOS, Android, or Windows. They are more complex compared to web apps and require separate development for each platform. ¢ Hybrid Apps: Hybrid apps combine features of both native and web apps. They are installed like native apps but offer a web app-like experience. Hybrid apps are built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and utilize a simplified browser within the app (known as a web view). Virtual ConFrerRENCcING MetHops Virtual conferencing methods enable individuals and groups to connect and collaborate remotely. They encompass audio conferencing, video conferencing, and teleconferencing. Let us explore each of these methods in more detail: Audio Conferencing e Audio conferencing is a computer-based communi- cation system that allows users in different locations to hold virtual meetings where they can hear one another, simulating real in-person conferences. e Multiple callers can join an audio conference by dial- ing into a conference bridge and using access num- bers and conference IDs. ° Itoffers cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and time-sav- ing advantages but lacks visual interactions, which can lead to potential distractions. e The two most common codecs used are G.711 and G.729. G.711 is a wideband codec that provides high-quality audio, but it requires more bandwidth.

Summary:
Mobile apps simplify tasks for users, with two main categories being web apps accessed through a browser and mobile apps designed for specific platforms, while virtual conferencing methods like audio conferencing allow remote collaboration without visual interactions.

teractions, which can lead to potential distractions. e The two most common codecs used are G.711 and G.729. G.711 is a wideband codec that provides high-quality audio, but it requires more bandwidth. G.729 is a nar- rowband codec that uses less bandwidth, but it also provides lower-quality audio. e Audio conferencing bridges can be either hardware- based or software-based. Hardware-based bridges are typically more expensive, but they offer better perfor- mance and scalability. Software-based bridges are less expensive, but they may not be as reliable or scalable. Video Conferencing e Video conferencing enables participants at different loca- tions to conduct virtual conferences where they can see and hear each other, as if they were in the same room. === Page 8 === ° It involves endpoints like cameras and microphones, an MCU (multi-point control unit or server), and network connections. During a point-to-point video call, participants’ voices and images are converted from analog to digital and back to analog when sent through the software. e Codecs like H.264 and VP8 are commonly. used to compress and decompress video signals. * Video conferencing bridges can be hardware-based or software-based, with hardware bridges being pre- ferred for high-quality video. ® Video conferencing requires a higher bandwidth than audio conferencing. Note that audio conferencing is typically more toler- ant of network latency than video conferencing. This is because video conferencing requires a constant stream of data to be transmitted in real time. Teleconferencing ° This technology combines audio and video confer- encing to connect participants via telephone or video communication. e Main Protocols: Three basic protocols include: 1. SIP (Session Initiation Protocol): This signal- ling protocol is used to establish, modify, and ter- minate teleconferencing sessions. 2. RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol): This trans- port protocol is used to transmit audio and video data between participants. 3. RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol): This control protocol is used to monitor the qual- ity of the teleconferencing session and to provide feedback to the participants.

Summary:
Audio conferencing uses codecs like G.711 and G.729, while video conferencing involves endpoints, codecs like H.264 and VP8, and bridges that can be hardware-based for high-quality video; teleconferencing combines audio and video using protocols like SIP, RTP, and RTCP.

Open source software: Examples are FreeSWITCH and Asterisk to create and manage teleconferencing systems. 2. Commercial software: Examples are Microsoft Skype for Business and Cisco Webex. ° It is used by organizations like the UNHCR, which employs tools like Skype for Business and Cisco WebEx to facilitate remote communication and collaboration. These virtual conferencing methods break down geo- graphical barriers, making it easier for individuals and organizations to connect, share information, and conduct meetings without the need for physical presence. This is used for business meetings, training sessions, educational seminars, and social gatherings. HD (High Definition) and SD (Standard Definition) The main difference between HD and SD videos is the res- olution, impacting the video quality, file size, and band- width requirements. HD (High Definition): HD video offers a higher reg, tion than SD. This means that the picture is clearey E more detailed. SD (Standard Definition): SD video has a lower rego tion than HD. The most common SD resolution is 486 with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. Video Uploading and Downloading The main points are as follow: 1. Other points are privacy, security, storage space afl device capability (such as smartphones, tablets, compu ers). Common HD resolutions include 720p and 10g where the number refers to the vertical pixels example, 1080p has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixel HD video requires more storage space and bandwj for streaming compared to SD due to the large; size.

Environmental Determinism And Possibilism: We need to understand the following two approaches and understand the shift from one to another. * Environmental Determinism: This is the idea that the physical environment, particularly the climate and terrain, actively shapes cultures, societies, and behaviours of individuals. It suggests a strong influ- ence of the environment on human behaviour and culture. ¢ Environmental Possibilism: As the name suggests, this explores the new ‘possibilities’ between humans and their environment, despite certain environmen- tal limitations. Through environmental possibilism, we focus on development with the help of technol- ogy, innovation, new energy explorations and so on. Industrialization and urbanization became way of life. This can be linked with anthropogenic activities which are to be discussed later. Thus, balancing of life was required in the form of sustainable development which we will discuss later. Right now we are discussing basic concepts of envi- ronment in the following topics. Ecology is the scientific study of interactions among organisms and between organisms and their environ- ment. Ecology examines how organisms adapt to their environment, how they interact with other species, and how they influence and are influenced by the non-living environment. The scope of ecology covers the study of individual organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems, and the giobal scale of the biosphere. (Take note that ecosys- tem is included here). The concept of ‘ecology’ was coined by Ernst Haeckel, a German biologist in 1869. LEVELS oF ECOLOGY Ecology can be understood at the following levels: 1. Individual Organism: Here, we study a single organ- ism and its interactions with its environment.

Summary:
The Environment (Protection) Act of 1986 defines the environment as the physical and biological surroundings of an organism, with two approaches, environmental determinism and possibilism, exploring the influence of the environment on human behavior and culture, leading to the need for sustainable development and the study of ecology at various levels.

Title: Levels of Ecology: Understanding the Interactions in Nature

, a German biologist in 1869. LEVELS oF ECOLOGY Ecology can be understood at the following levels: 1. Individual Organism: Here, we study a single organ- ism and its interactions with its environment. It’s essential to see into where it lives (habitations), how it adapts to its surroundings (adaptations), and th potential threats it faces (safety). ? For instance, let’s take the example of a frog, w, can examine how it locates food sources, ensures it safety, and employs protective adaptations in its hab; tat. We can also investigate how it thrives in a mojg environment to maintain skin moisture and repro duces by laying eggs in the water. : 2. Species: A species is a group of similar individu, organisms that are capable of interbreeding to pro duce fertile offspring and share common characteris tics. For example, different species of human beings roses or trees. The name of species of human beings j homo sapiens. Species is a step above the individual organism. They take us towards population. Their interactions take place a the following levels: 1. Within species - population ecology 2. Between species - community ecology : 3. Between organisms and their physical environ. ment - ecosystem ecology Some Central Role Playing Species: We can discuss the following: Keystone Species: Keystone means holding everything together. Keystone species plays a unique and crucial role. in the functioning of an ecosystem. ° They are assumed to be essential for the health and biodiversity of our planet’s ecosystems. They may be less in number, but their impact on ecosystem is much. bigger. ° By maintaining balance of nature, they also provide essential services to other species. Without keystone species, ecosystems would be much less diverse and resilient. ° Keystone species function as predators as they con-. trol the populations of other animals. They actually function as mutualists for benefits of more than one species or create or modify habitats for other species. For example, in the Sundarbans mangrove forest. in India, the Indian elephant is a keystone species because of its large impact on the environment. ° There is an excellent example: ‘Termites’, particu-.

Ecology can be understood at different levels, including individual organisms, species, and interactions between organisms and their environment, with keystone species playing a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem health and biodiversity.

Title: The Importance of Critical Link Species in Ecosystems

Text:
r example, in the Sundarbans mangrove forest. in India, the Indian elephant is a keystone species because of its large impact on the environment. ° There is an excellent example: ‘Termites’, particu-. larly in savanna or arid regions, construct large, complex mounds from soil, saliva, and excrement. These structures are essential for regulating the colony’s temperature and humidity which are cru- cial for survival. Additionally, termite mounds improve soil quality and water infiltration, which offer microhabitats for diverse species and thus. enhancing biodiversity in their ecosystems. ee ee ee ee ee eee Critical Link Species: This term is broader than that of keystone species. This includes any species that plays 4 vital role in the functioning of an ecosystem. They play === Page 37 === al role in connecting different parts of an ecosystem. may look at the following terms: cosystem Engineers: They physically alter their environment. Foundation Species: They create and define entire ecosystems, like coral in a coral reef. Umbrella Species: Conservation of these species pro- ects a wide range of other species. ndicator Species: They indicate the health of an cosystem. Flagship Species: These are charismatic species used s a symbol to stimulate conservation awareness and ction. emic Species: Endemic species are typically asso- d with specific geographic regions and are found rally only in those particular areas. Global exam- is of endemic are Lion-tailed Macaque in Western s, Nilgiri Tahr in Nilgiri range (both in India), kapo (a flightless parrot) in New Zealand, Giant nda in China are few examples which.are not natu- ly found anywhere else in the world. Human beings found almost everywhere and not an example of demic species. ‘Population: This level deals with groups of the same species, exploring their dynamics, interactions, and coexistence in a particular habitat. The following aspects are crucial for population specially for human beings. 1. Reproduction and Natality: The production of new individual organisms from their parents through this biological process. Natality refers to the birth rate, or the frequency of births within a population.

Summary:
Keystone species, such as the Indian elephant and termites, play a vital role in regulating ecosystems and enhancing biodiversity, while other critical link species, like ecosystem engineers and indicator species, also contribute to the functioning of an ecosystem.

oduction and Natality: The production of new individual organisms from their parents through this biological process. Natality refers to the birth rate, or the frequency of births within a population. Population Growth Rate: We need to factor birth and death rates as well as immigration and emigration. Age Structure or Distribution with in popula- tion: Pre-reproductive (too young to reproduce), reproductive, and post-reproductive (beyond a age). Population Dispersal: This takes care of move- ments - emigration (leaving a region), immigra- tion (entering a region), and migration (seasonal or periodic movemient). Predation: In this interaction one organism, the predator, kills and eats another organism, its prey. Mortality: This is the death rate, indicating the frequency of deaths within a population. Carrying Capacity: The maximum number of individuals of a particular species that a specific environment can sustain indefinitely without degrading the environment. Metapopulations: Let’s take an example of deer. Metapopulations include several deer populations spread across different forests, connected by migrat- ing individuals. it plays 4 They play 4. Community: This refers to all living things in an area, how do the different species interact, influence each other, and maintain the balance of the ecosystem. Community talks about interdependence, competi- tion (for space and resources) and disturbances (pol- lution and intervention by other communities). For example, in a pond, it is the interaction of frogs, fish, insects, plants et. Community is an experience that tells us how do different species interact. The fish might eat some of the insects, controlling the insect population, and thus benefits the plants. Ecological Niche: We discussed some interactions. Ecological niche refers to the specific role and position that an organism or species occupies within an ecosystem. The following aspects are important to us for niches: Habitat: The area or natural environment in which an organism or population normally lives is called a habitat. A habitat is made up of two types of factors: 1. Physical factors such as soil, moisture, temperature and light 2.

al environment in which an organism or population normally lives is called a habitat. A habitat is made up of two types of factors: 1. Physical factors such as soil, moisture, temperature and light 2. Biotic factors such as availability of food and predators Cohabitat: When organisms of different species live together. Microhabitat: When particular organism(s) live in a small and specific part(s) of a habitat. A habitat is not always a geographical area. Example: Frogs are ectothermic as their temperature is regulated by the environment. They prefer staying in aquatic and moist terrestrial localities such as freshwa- ters, wetlands, rainforests etc. The habitat of human beings is incredibly diverse and spans the entire planet. e Resource Utilization: The types of food, shelter, and other resources etc. ° Behavioural Patterns: This includes feeding habits, reproduction strategies, routine life patterns. e Interactions: This refers to relationships with other species, that includes competition, predation, and mutualism. e Tolerance Limits: This refers to range of environ- mental conditions such as temperature, humidity, pH etc. that the organism can tolerate, Ecological Footprint and its Measurement: Though Earth is assumed like a mother, the give and take rela- tionship is crucial for sustainability for present and future generations. The ecological footprint measures how much nature we use—like food, water, and energy. It checks whether we use more than Earth can provide. Think of it as nature’s balance sheet. We should aim to use only what Earth can give us. We can use the idea of measuring ecological footprint for smail things, like how much water is used by a person, or big things, like the energy used by a whole city, such as === Page 38 === Mumbai. We measure ecological footprint in ‘global hect- ares’ (gha). One global hectare represents what Earth can renew or regenerate in a year.’ Ecological succession: This is how some ecological (or ecosystem) slowly change over the time. This happens at two stages: 1. Primary succession: This begins in places without life, like rocks, where simple organisms like lichens start making soil.

Summary:
A habitat is the natural environment in which an organism or population lives, consisting of physical and biotic factors, with examples including cohabitat and microhabitat, and is important for resource utilization, behavioral patterns, interactions with other species, tolerance limits, and measuring ecological footprint for sustainability.

al (or ecosystem) slowly change over the time. This happens at two stages: 1. Primary succession: This begins in places without life, like rocks, where simple organisms like lichens start making soil. This allows more plants to grow later. 2. Secondary succession: During this succession, the ecosystem evolves from simple to more complex com- munities, eventually reaching a stable state. Types of Ecology: From a study perspective, ecology has two branches: e Autecology: This is the study of ‘individual organ- isms or a single species’ and their interactions with the environment. It looks into the life cycle, behav- iour, adaptations, and how these organisms or species survive and thrive. This makes us understand the spe- cific roles and impacts these organisms have within their ecosystems. ¢ Synecology: This studies how ‘different species in a community’ interact within their ecosystem. It looks at how these groups live together, their roles, and how energy and nutrients flow between them, which is key for understanding the ecosystem’s overall functioning. Haute Ecology: This represents an entirely different per- spective, Haute Ecology represents a more interdiscipli- nary and applied approach, blending ecology with other fields such as design, engineering, and architecture. Individual Population Community Ecosystem Biome Biosphere Figure 9.1 Main Aspects of Environment The term ‘ecosystem’ was introduced by Arthur Tansley in 1935. It describes a self-regulating community where liv- ing organisms interact with each other and their physical environment. For example, in a pond ecosystem, various plants, animals, and microorganisms coexist and intera, within their specific aquatic environment. : 1. Biological Components (Biotic): This includes the living things in the pond, such as plants, anima (frogs, fish, insects), bacteria, and algae. 2. Physical Components (Abiotic): These are the nog living parts of the ecosystem, such as water, sg nutrients, sunlight, and temperature. : The other components worth most discussing are: follows: Enercy Fiow, Foop Crains ano Nutrient CyYcLes Energy Flow: The Sun is the primary source of energy most ecosystems.

Summary:
Ecosystems change over time through primary and secondary succession, with ecology studying individual organisms and species interactions (autecology) as well as different species interactions within a community (synecology), while haute ecology blends ecology with other fields like design and engineering to understand the overall functioning of ecosystems.

Title: Energy Flow in Ecosystems

unlight, and temperature. : The other components worth most discussing are: follows: Enercy Fiow, Foop Crains ano Nutrient CyYcLes Energy Flow: The Sun is the primary source of energy most ecosystems. Sunlight is captured by producers, ]j plants, through the process of photosynthesis. i. Producers (Autotrophs): These are organisms, typ cally plants and algae, make their own food using su light, water, and carbon dioxide. They form the base of the energy pyramid in an ecosystem. / 2. Consumers (Heterotrophs): These organisms can. not produce their own food and must consume othe: organisms. Consumers are divided into different categories: e Primary Consumers: Herbivores that eat producers. * Secondary Consumers: Carnivores or omnivore that eat primary consumers. e Tertiary Consumers: Predators that eat second- ary consumers. 3. Decomposers and Detritivores: These organism like fungi and bacteria, break down dead organisms and waste materials, releasing nutrients back into the environment. They play a crucial role in recycling energy and matter within the ecosystem. 4. Energy Transfer: Energy is transferred between tro- phic levels (producers, consumers, decomposers), typically through consumption. However, during each transfer, some energy is lost as heat due to met: abolic processes, as described by the Second Law 0 Thermodynamics. 5. Energy Loss and 10% Energy Rule: The energy flow is always uni-directional; it goes in one direction. The concept of energy loss tells us about the essence 0 ‘unidirectional’ (one way) energy flow in ecosystems. Energy moves from one trophic level to another but ‘without any returning’. A significant portion of energy is lost as heat during various biological processes like digestion, metabolism, maintaining body temperature etc. Thus, we need the continuous energy input, primal ily from sunlight, to sustain the different trophic levels in an ecosystem. The 10% Energy Rule also tells us that only 10% of energy is transferred from one tropic levé to another, and 90% is the ‘Energy Loss’. Include the following definitions also, This can be understood bet ter with the help of a diagram, refer figure 9.4.

Summary:
Energy flow in ecosystems is primarily driven by the sun, with producers capturing sunlight through photosynthesis to form the base of the energy pyramid, followed by consumers (herbivores, carnivores, predators) and decomposers/detritivores that recycle nutrients back into the environment, with energy transfer between trophic levels resulting in energy loss as heat and only 10% of energy being transferred between levels.

Pyramid of Energy: This represents the flow of energy through an ecosystem. Energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, but not all of it is available for consumption at the next level. In fact, only about 10% of the energy is transferred to the next level, with the remaining 90% being lost as heat or used in respiration. We can again look at grass + deer— tiger. The energy is lost at each trophic level. 2. Pyramid of Numbers: The pyramid of numbers rep- resents the number of organisms at each trophic level. The pyramid of numbers can be upright, inverted, or partly upright. ; Upright Pyramid: In a forest ecosystem, the trees are the primary producers, and most numerous. There are fewer herbivores, such as deer or rabbits, and even fewer carnivores, such as wolves or bears. Inverted Pyramid: In a marine or aquatic ecosys- tem such as pond, the biomass of primary consumers (zooplankton, the herbivores) can indeed be larger than the biomass of primary producers (phytoplank- ton, reproduce quickly). 3.

Thi following concepts are important in ecotone. 1. Edge Effect: The edge effect in ecology refers to th changes in population or community structures tha occur at the boundary of two or more habitats. Area where different habitats meet, such as forests and grasslands, are known as ‘edges.’ This effect has sev eral key aspects such as increased diversity at bound aries, differential environment conditions, specie interaction. The whole situation may be beneficial t some, but detrimental for others. Human activities often create artificial edges, suc as those formed by agriculture, logging, or urba development. 2. Habitat loss: This refers to the disappearance of nat ural environments that are home to particular plants” and animals. This may occur due to deforestation, urbanization, agriculture expansion, climate change, pollution etc. 3. Biodiversity Hotspots: Biodiversity hotspots are areas of high ecological richness and diversity, often === Page 1 === found in ecotones, which are transition zones between ‘different ecosystems. These ecotones showcase a greater variety of plant and animal life compared to the neighbouring ecosystems. : Fragmentation: Fragmentation turns a large, con- tinuous natural area (like an ecotone) into smaller, -_jsolated pieces due to human development activities. This is harmful as it reduces the overall area where ants and animals can live.

The exosphere, Earth’s outermost atmospheric layer, extends from the top of the thermosphere up to about 10,000 km. It marks the transition where the atmosphere gradu- ally merges into space and contains particles, like hydrogen and helium atoms, potentially escaping Earth’s gravity. Karman Line: This is an internationally recognized boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and outer space. It is defined at an altitude of 100 kilometers. Above this line, the air is too thin for conventional air- craft to generate lift. Which of the following options correctly describes key concepts in the field of environmental science? (a) Ecology is the study of interactions between living organisms and their environment. (b) An ecosystem is a specific geographic area with distinct biological communities. (c) An ecotone is a transition zone between two dif- ferent ecosystems, where species from both com- munities interact. (d) All of the above.

Summary:
Exposure to high levels of UV radiation can lead to skin cancer, cataracts, and damage to the DNA of living cells.

They play a crucial role in the Earth’s ecosystem, providing habitat for a multitude of species, influencing climate patterns, and serving as significant carbon sinks. FORESTS AS A RESOURCE * Biodiversity: Forests are caste and cradle to biodi- versity, they are rich in it. They function as ‘terrestrial lungs’ of the earth, they regulate climate and main- taining air quality. they house a vast array of flora and fauna, including several endangered species. National Parks, Wild Sanctuary Parks, Biosphere reserves are required to conserve biodiversity. e Economic Value: They contribute to the economy through timber, non-timber forest products (like medicinal plants and bamboo), and ecotourism. e Environmental Importance: Forests in India play a vital role in water conservation, soil preservation, and climate regulation. Facts Aspout Forests in INDIA * India has tropical evergreens, deciduous forests, thorn forests, and mangroves. The Western Ghats, the Eastern Himalayas, and the Northeastern region are some of the most forest-rich areas. India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2021: *. The ISFR 2021 shows an increase of 0.28% in for- est and tree cover, with a slight increase of 0.22% in forest cover and 0.76% in tree cover compared to the previous report.

The forest cover percentage is more than 75%. oe ° India’s forest and tree cover is still below the global. average. DEFORESTATION Deforestation is the extensive removal of Earth’s forests leading to land degradation. At the current rate of defor. estation, the world’s precious rainforests are predicted to. disappear within a century. The primary drivers of defor. estation include: 1. Agriculture Expansion: Agriculture, including sub sistence and commercial farming, is the leading cause _ of deforestation, responsible for 85% of forest loss. 2. Shifting Cultivation: This practice, seen in regions _ like Assam and Madagascar, involves clearing small. patches of tropical forests for crops. They lead to a. pattern of unsustainable land use practices. This often occurs in tropical regions with fertile soils. 3. Timber Harvesting: The logging for wood and paper products contributes to 14% of deforestation Countries like Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, and various African nations are prominent. examples. 4. Hill Slope Cultivation: Terrace farming, known as contour farming, involves farming on narrow steps _ cut across hillsides. This practice can lead to soil erosion. 5. Wildfires: These are influenced by human and nat- ural factors. Climate change has increased the fre- quency and intensity of wildfires. Australia, Canada can be taken as the best examples. Negative Effects of Deforestation Deforestation has significant environmental conse- quences: 1. Climate Change: Deforestation results in less carbon dioxide absorption, leading to increased Green House Gas emissions and global warming. 2. Water Cycle Disruption: Trees contribute to the water cycle by returning water vapor to the atmo- sphere. Deforestation decreases precipitation, impact- ing water availability. === Page 5 === soil Erosion: Tree roots stabilize soil, preventing ero- sion and landslides. Deforestation raises the risk of Jandslides and flash floods. pesertification: Excessive tree removal contributes to desertification, particularly in drylands.

Summary:
Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, and Manipur have the highest forest cover percentage in India, but deforestation driven by agriculture expansion, shifting cultivation, timber harvesting, hill slope cultivation, and wildfires is leading to significant environmental consequences such as climate change, water cycle disruption, soil erosion, and desertification.

EARTHQUAKES An earthquake is a sudden shaking of the Earth’s crust, often with no warning, making prediction nearly impossi- ble. Seismology is the scientific study of earthquakes and the seismic waves they generate. Causes of Earthquakes e The Earth’s crust consists of plates, and the theory of plate tectonics explains that stress occurs when these plates interact. We can see the following concept: ° Pangaea Breakup: Pangaea is a supercontinent that existed about 200 million years ago. This breakup led to the formation of the continents as we know them today.

Summary:
Deforestation increases the risk of landslides and flash floods, contributes to desertification and biodiversity loss, and various forestation programs in India aim to increase forest cover and protect ecosystems, while natural hazards such as earthquakes are caused by the interaction of Earth's tectonic plates.

t. We can see the following concept: ° Pangaea Breakup: Pangaea is a supercontinent that existed about 200 million years ago. This breakup led to the formation of the continents as we know them today. India is an example of that. The Himalayas formed as a result of this collision between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. That process is still con- tinuing, Himalayas rise a few centimetres every year, and earthquakes do happen. e Plates pull apart, push against each other, or slide sideways, creating stress along plate boundaries known as faults. : e When stress ona fault reaches a breaking point, it results in a fault rupture and the release of seismic waves, radi- ating from an underground point known as the focus. Types of Seismic Waves e There are two main types of seismic. waves: body waves and surface waves. e Body waves: These travel through the Earth’s inte- rior and include primary (P) waves and secondary (S) waves. ° P waves are faster and typically the first to reach seismograph stations. : e Surface waves: These move along the Earth’s crust, shaking it both horizontally and vertically. e Love waves (named after A.E.H. Love, a British mathematician) cause horizontal motion, mov- ing the ground from side to side. They occur as a - result of an earthquake. They propagate outward from the earthquake’s epicenter. === Page 6 === * Rayleigh waves (named after Lord Rayleigh, the British physicist) produce vertical and side-to- side motion, which can damage buildings and infrastructure.

Summary:
The breakup of Pangaea led to the formation of the continents as we know them today, with the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates resulting in the formation of the Himalayas, where earthquakes occur due to stress along faults, with seismic waves including body waves and surface waves, measured on the Richter scale to quantify the energy released during an earthquake.

earthquakes with magnitudes below 3.0 or above 7.0 as the scale gets saturated beyond a level. ° Seismograph: This device records the vibrations of the ground during an earthquake. This data is then. used to calculate the earthquake’s magnitude on the Richter Scale. ° Magnitude and Energy Release: Each whole num}, increase on the Richter Scale (e.g., from 6.5 to 7 indicates a tenfold increase in the shaking amplituq _ (ground motions) and approximately 30-32 (31.6 i _ be more precise) times more energy release. The Classification of intensification of Earthquakes 1. Micro earthquakes: Less than 2.0 magnitude - They are very small, they are typically not felt by humans 2. Minor earthquakes: 2.0-3.9 magnitude - They are often felt as a trembling or shaking sensation, byt they rarely cause damage. 3. Major earthquakes: 4.0-5.9 magnitude - They can cause moderate damage to buildings and infrastryc. ture, especially if they occur in densely populateg areas. 4. Great earthquakes: 6.0-6.9 magnitude - They are capable of causing significant damage and wide. spread destruction. 5. Higher earthquakes: 7.0 magnitude and above. They are the most powerful earthquakes, capable of causing catastrophic damage and widespread destruction over large areas. A Shift Towards Moment Magnitude Scale (MM Scale): MM more accurately measure the energy of larger earth- quakes and is more universally applicable globally. The MM Scale is a seismic scale used for measuring the intensity of an earthquake. Unlike scales that measure the energy or magnitude of an earthquake, the MM Scale assesses the effects and damage caused by the earthquake. It is a descriptive scale, using Roman numerals from I to XII to denote increasing levels of damage and impact: — 1. I (Not felt): Barely noticeable, if at all. 2. XII (Extreme): Total destruction — objects thrown into the air, landscapes changed. Seismic Zones in India © India is divided into four seismic zones: Zone II, Ill, [V, and V, with Zone V being the most seismically active and Zone II the least. ° Zone V includes northeastern India, parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and more. ° Zone IV covers remaining parts of Jammu and.

Summary:
Earthquakes are classified based on their magnitude, with higher magnitudes indicating more powerful earthquakes that can cause catastrophic damage, and the Moment Magnitude Scale is used to assess the effects and damage caused by earthquakes globally.

It makes people understand why certain regions are more prone to seismic activities. preparedness Measures: Teaching practical skills like ‘Drop, Cover, and Hold On’, how to create an emergency kit, and evacuation routes. gineered Structures Design and Construction: To follow seismic design principles, like flexibility in structures, appropriate load distribution, and using materials that can with- stand vibrations. Architectural and Engineering Integration: Architects and engineers must collaborate to incor- porate aesthetic elements without compromising the building’s seismic resilience. Soil Analysis: Before construction, it’s vital to assess the soil’s ability to support a structure during an earthquake. Soil types like clay or sand can amplify seismic waves, thus requiring specialized foundation techniques.

Summary:
Different zones in India have varying levels of seismic activity, with Zone V being the most active, and effective earthquake mitigation practices involve robust construction, public preparedness, engineering, and technology for early warnings, as well as adherence to building codes and guidelines, public education on earthquakes, and soil analysis before construction.

These systems can provide crucial seconds to minutes of warning, allowing people and systems to initiate pre- defined safety protocols. Public Alert Systems: These can range from mobile alerts, sirens, to broadcast systems, ensuring timely and widespread dissemination of warnings to all seg- ments of the population. SUNAMIS he term ‘tsunami? originates from the Japanese words Tsu,’ -meaning harbour, and ‘nami, meaning waves. stinamis are a series of ocean waves characterized by ery long wavelengths, often spanning hundreds of kms. hey are typically caused by significant disturbances in _the ocean, including: 1. Earthquakes ~ primarily cause of earthquakes. 2. Landslides 3. Voleanic eruptions 4. Explosions 5. Meteorite impacts ° These disturbances can occur beneath the ocean’s surface (e.g., underwater earthquakes or submarine landslides) or from above (e.g., meteorite impacts). e Tsunamis have a large wave height, long wave period and high velocity.. Tsunamis can have wavelengths ranging from 10 to 500 kms, with wave periods of up to an hour. Due to their long wavelengths, tsunamis behave as shallow-water waves. * When tsunamis approach the shore, they can reach significant vertical heights, often referred to as ‘run- up heights. The depth of the ocean is the primary fac- tor determining the height of a tsunami wave when it reaches the shore. e As tsunamis approach shallow coastal waters, their speed increases, while their wavelength decreases. © Tsunamis can travel across the open ocean at approxi- mately 100 kms per hour. A series of waves that make up a tsunami is called a ‘tsunami train.’ e Tsunamis have the potential to cause massive destruc- tion upon reaching the coastline, leading to coastal erosion, vegetation loss, and limited warning time for coastal residents.

Summary:
Assessing soil stability, utilizing advanced monitoring technologies, and implementing public alert systems are crucial in preparing for earthquakes and tsunamis, which can cause significant destruction and loss of life.

The Naming of Cyclones The cyclones are named by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a part of UN. WMO has six regional specialized meteorological centres (RSMCs) for naming cyclones in their respective regions. The RSMC for India is the IMD (India Meteorological Department) which maintains 169 names. The names are suggested by the 13 member countries of the WMO/ Economic and Social Coramission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Panel on Tropical Cyclones. The names are chosen to be familiar and easily recognizable to the people in the region. The names of cyclones-in India in 2023 were Agn Akash, Bijli, Onil, Ogni, Nisha, Giri, Varun, Murasy and Aag.

Sea is a deeper ang more elongated sea that is less conducive to the for. mation of cyclones. 2. The Bay of Bengal has warmer Sea Surface Temperature (SST) than the Arabian Sea. Warm SSTs are a neces. sary condition for the formation of cyclones, as they provide the energy needed for cyclones to develop and intensify. 3. Moreover, the Bay of Bengal has lower vertical wind shear than the Arabian Sea, which makes it more favorable for the formation of cyclones. Volcanoes Volcanoes are openings or ruptures in the Earth’s surface or crust. They are typically associated with the release of extremely hot gases, ash, sulphur, steam, and other mat rials during eruptions, known as pyroclastic flows. Thes flows can reach speeds of more than 700 kms per hour and can be highly destructive. Volcanoes are often found in regions where tecton plates either converge (collide) or diverge (move apart). Subduction zones, where an oceanic plate sinks beneath a continental plate, are common locations for volcanic activ- ity. Volcanoes also exist along the edges of tectonic plates, such as the ‘Ring of Fire’ encircling the Pacific Ocean.

There are three main types of floods: jash floods, riverine floods, and urban floods. lash Floods ‘lash floods are rapid inland floods caused by intense infall. They can occur in sloped or flat terrains, but they gre most common in sloped terrains where the water ows rapidly with high destructive potential. Flash floods can occur virtually anywhere, even in areas that are not typically prone to flooding. Causes of Flash Floods Heavy rainfall in a short span of time: Flash floods are typically associated with thunderstorms, which can produce very heavy rainfall in a short amount of time.

Summary:
The Bay of Bengal is more favorable for the formation of cyclones due to its warmer sea surface temperatures and lower vertical wind shear, while volcanoes are openings in the Earth's surface that can have destructive consequences such as threatening aircraft with volcanic ash and altering global temperatures.

e to flooding. Causes of Flash Floods Heavy rainfall in a short span of time: Flash floods are typically associated with thunderstorms, which can produce very heavy rainfall in a short amount of time. Heavy siltation of the river bed: Siltation is the buildup of sediment in the river bed. Heavy siltation can reduce the water-carrying capacity of rivers and streams, mak- ing them more likely to overflow during heavy rainfall. Blockage in the drains: Blockages in drains can also lead to flash flooding, as the water cannot drain away quickly enough. Blockages can be caused by debris, leaves, or even animals. Landslides blocking the flow of the stream: Landslides can block the flow of streams, causing water to back up and flood the surrounding area. ¢ Construction of dams and reservoirs: Dams and reservoirs can help to control flooding, but they can also increase the risk of flash flooding if they are not properly managed. ° Strong winds accompanied by heavy downpour along with storm surge in areas prone to cyclones: Cyclones can produce strong winds and heavy rainfall, which can lead to flash flooding. Storm surge, which is a wall of water that is pushed up the coast by a cyclone, can also contribute to flash flooding in coastal areas. » Catabatic Winds: Winds that flow downhill, usually at night when the air cools and becomes denser. They can push warm, moist air up slopes, leading to cloud forma- tion and heavy rain, potentially causing flash floods. ° Anabatic Winds: Winds that flow uphill, typically _ during the day when the ground heats up, making the air less dense. These winds can break up clouds, reducing the likelihood of flash flooding. CLoupBURST ® Cloudburst is an intense, brief rainfall event with hail and thunder, causing flash floods and landslides. e It lasts only a few minutes but can bring a massive amount of rain. e Cloudbursts are unpredictable and can lead to severe weather events, like the 2013 disaster in Uttarakhand, India, causing loss of life. DrouGHT Drought is when there’s not enough rain for a long time, causing problems like water shortages, failed crops, and distress.

Summary:
Flash floods can be caused by heavy rainfall, siltation of river beds, blockages in drains, landslides, construction of dams and reservoirs, strong winds and storm surges from cyclones, catabatic and anabatic winds, and cloudbursts, which can lead to severe weather events and loss of life, while droughts result from prolonged lack of rain causing water shortages, failed crops, and distress.

like the 2013 disaster in Uttarakhand, India, causing loss of life. DrouGHT Drought is when there’s not enough rain for a long time, causing problems like water shortages, failed crops, and distress. Even places with lots of rain, like Kerala, can experience drought when there’s an imbalance between water supply and demand. There are four primary types of droughts: 1. Meteorological Drought: Characterized by less rain- fall than usual, resulting in prolonged periods of sun and heat.. 2. Hydrological Drought: Happens when water bodies like rivers and groundwater are reduced, leading to a shortage of water. 3. Agricultural Drought: Occurs when soil moisture is too low for crops to grow properly, potentially leading to food shortages. 4, Socioeconomic Drought: A situation where water scarcity impacts the economy and society, affecting food, water availability, and jobs. Artificial Rain Cloud seeding is important for reducing droughts, help- ing agriculture, managing forest fires, and cutting air pol- lution. It involves spreading materials like silver iodide or dry ice in clouds to cause rain. Drones and aircraft are used for this. Nations such as China, UAE, and the USA widely use cloud seeding for different environmental needs, showing its global importance. LANDSLIDES Landslides are the downward and outward movement of slope-forming materials, such as rocks, soils, and artificial fills, along surfaces of separation. They can be slow or fast, and can occur in a variety of settings, including moun- tainous terrains, areas with steep slopes, and areas where human activities have disturbed the natural landscape. Causes of Landslides Landslides are influenced by several factors: ° Geological Factors: Weakness in slope materials like soil or rock increases landslide risk. e Erosion: Caused by rainfall, wind, or human activi- ties like deforestation, erosion makes slopes more prone to landslides. oo ° Heavy Rainfall: This can saturate and increase the weight of slope materials, triggering landslides on steep terrain. e Human Activities: Mining, deforestation, irrigation, and construction can destabilize slopes.

Summary:
Droughts, including meteorological, hydrological, agricultural, and socioeconomic types, can lead to water shortages, failed crops, and economic impacts, while landslides are caused by factors such as geological weaknesses, erosion, heavy rainfall, and human activities, with cloud seeding being used to mitigate droughts and landslides occurring in various settings.

Landslides can lead to loss of life, property damage, and environmental impacts. Mitigation includes careful land use, soil stabilization, and proper drainage management. Wildfires A wildfire refers to an uncontrolled fire that ignites in combustible vegetation in rural or wilderness areas. What sets wildfires apart from other types of fires is their exten- sive size and rapid spread far beyond the initial source. Additionally, wildfires are unpredictable, capable of changing direction suddenly and leaping over natural or man-made barriers like roads, rivers, and firebreaks. Nationa Disaster Manacement Act or 2005 ~ NDMA NDMA of 2005 in India designates the Ministry of Home Affairs as the primary coordinator for disaster manage- ment. Key decision-making bodies include the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), with the Prime Minister as a member, and the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC). NDMA plays a crucial role in developing disaster management plans and overseeing their implementation at the national level.

Level L1: Refers to disasters manageable at the dis- trict level, with state authorities on standby to assist if necessary. 3. Level L2: Involves disasters requiring state-level intervention and resources, with central agencies ready for immediate deployment if needed. 4. Level L3: Indicates large-scale or catastrophic events that surpass district and state capabilities, necessitat- ing central intervention. The NDMA and other central government agencies pla supporting role at Level L1 and L2 disasters.

Summary:
Various factors such as human activities, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and wildfires can trigger landslides, leading to loss of life, property damage, and environmental impacts, with mitigation strategies including careful land use, soil stabilization, and proper drainage management, as outlined in the National Disaster Management Act of 2005 in India.

It adopted the motto ‘The Future We Want.’ It reviewed progress, and focused the need for inclusivity and participation. This laid the groundwork for the SDGs in 2015. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): After 2015, countries agreed on new goals to make the _-world better by 2030. These goals are about things - care of our planet. iLLENIUM DeveLopment Goats (MDGS) DGs were set up in September 2000. These MDGs consisted of eight goals for a target ' achievement year of 2015. These goals focused on combating poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation, and discrimination against women. The MDGs emphasized human capital, infrastructure, and human rights to improve living standards. e Eight MDGs were:. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. Achieve universal primary education. Promote gender equality and empower women. 4. Reduce child mortality. 5. Improve maternal health. 6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. Ensure environmental sustainability. Develop a global partnership for development. A Shift from MDGs To SDGs The shift represents a significant evolution in global devel- opment objectives. Key differentiating points include:. Zero Goals: Unlike MDGs which aimed for halfway targets, SDGs aim for complete eradication, e.g., zero hunger, zero preventable child deaths. Universal Goals: SDGs apply universally to all coun- tries, addressing inequalities within and among coun- tries, unlike the MDGs’ donor-recipient approach. Comprehensive and Inclusive: SDGs are more inclu- sive, covering broader areas like gender and people’s participation, and they segregate goals like hunger and poverty, which were combined in MDGs. Funding: SDGs emphasize sustainability and inclu- sive economic development for self-reliance, mov- ing away from MDGs’ reliance on aid from developed countries.

Summary:
The UNFCCC is crucial in global climate negotiations, while the Millennium Development Goals focused on combating poverty, hunger, disease, and discrimination against women, leading to the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 which aim for complete eradication of issues such as hunger and child mortality, apply universally to all countries, and emphasize sustainability and inclusive economic development.

Energy is the ability to do work or cause change. It’s fun- damental in nature. For examples, radiant energy from the sun warms Earth. Cars use mechanical energy from fuel. We use elec- trical energy to charge phones. 1. Conservation Law: Energy can’t be created or destroyed, only changed in form. This is key to under- standing energy dynamics. 2. Energy in Society: Essential for food and water secu- rity, development, and climate adaptation. The pro- duction and use may become part of anthropogenic activities. 3. Shift to Renewables: Moving from natural to human- driven conditions requires more renewable energy. Ipea. Enercy Source CHARACTERISTICS * Optimal heat production per unit volume/mass ° Easy transportation ° Minimal pollution ® Cost-effectiveness ¢ Energy, the ability to do work, is fundamental for liv- ing beings, machinery, and all forms of matter. The progress of civilization hinges on the availability and use of energy. * Energy exists in various forms, each serving differ- ent purposes and evolving over time to meet human needs. Common Forms or Enercy 1. Mechanical Energy: Kinetic Energy (KE): This is the energy that an object possesses due to its motion. For example, a moving car or a rolling ball has kinetic energy because of its movement. Potential Energy (PE): This energy type relates to an object’s position or state. Examples are compressed springs, a book lying on the table, and water in the dam.

etic energy because of its movement. Potential Energy (PE): This energy type relates to an object’s position or state. Examples are compressed springs, a book lying on the table, and water in the dam. The stored energy in a compressed spring or an elevated object (such as water in dams) can be con- verted into kinetic energy when released, as in the case of a falling book or energy production through dams. This energy is known as PE. Law of Conservation of Energy: e Energy remains constant in the universe, trans- forming from one form to another. This is exem- plified by the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy in hydroelectric dams. e Besides transformation, the energy balance is important. 2. Thermal Energy: This is related to the temperature of asubstance, arising from the movement of molecules. Chemical Energy: We can take an example of coal that is a fossil fuel. It has been discussed separately. Nuclear Energy: When nuclear mass is converted into thermal energy. === Page 16 === InDIA’s Enercy LANDSCAPE ° The Electricity Act of 2003 was aimed at introducing competition, safeguarding consumer interests, and ensuring power for all. ® India’s energy sector is diverse, with contributions from central, state, and private sectors. ® India is the third-largest electricity producer and sec- ond-largest consumer globally. ® India uses a diverse energy mix in the following forms: ENERGY CLASSIFICATION ° Primary Energy: Natural sources like coal and sun- light. This can be renewable (like sunlight) or non- renewable (like coal). ¢ Secondary Energy: Converted forms like electricity, suitable for consumption in homes and industries. Fossil Fuels Fossil Fuels are Non-Renewable Fuels. The main type of non-renewable energy, formed from decayed plants and animals over millions of years. They are Limited in quan- tity and diminish with use. The main examples are coal, oil, and natural gas. They are mostly used in transporta- tion and energy sectors.

We can see the energy conversion from the following points: 1. Gravitational Energy: Water stored in a reservoir at a high elevation possesses gravitational potential energy, that is due to pull of gravity. 2. Potential Energy Conversion into Kinetic Energy: Once the water is released from the reservoir and starts coming down, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. 3, Kinetic Energy: As the water flows downward, it gains speed, and its kinetic energy increases with the more downward flow of water. This rotates the turbines. 4. Turbine Rotation: The rotational motion of the tur- bines represents mechanical energy. That is trans- ferred to generators through a shaft connection. Electricity Generation: Inside the generators, the mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy through a process called electromagnetic induction.

India’s Biofuel Goal: Aims for 20% ethanol in petro (E20) and 5% biodiesel (E05) in diesel by 2030,.a per the National Policy on Biofuels (2018). 3. Energy Security: Ethanol reduces the oil imports thus enhances energy independence. Comparison with Petrol (or Gasoline): Ethanol ha lower energy content compared to gasoline, meanin more ethanol is needed to produce the same energy. Tha is linked with energy density. But Ethanol combustion emits fewer greenhouse gase: than gasoline, aiding in climate change mitigation. Higher ethanol blends require modifications in trad tional gasoline engines. Biodiesel in National Biofuel Policy 1. National Biofuel Policy Feedstocks: Encompasse a wide range of materials like sugarcane, maize, so ghum, sweet potato, cassava, tapioca, algae, municip solid waste, agricultural residues, and animal waste. 2. Ethanol Production: Involves fermenting sugars of starches found in feedstocks like sugarcane and maize. About Biodiesel 1. The Main Feedstocks for Biodiesel are oilseeds like soybean, rapeseed (canola), sunflower, palm oil, an jatropha. * Used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats are also. sources. * Algae is another potential feedstock. 2.

Jatropha is a non-food, drought-resistant plant, ideal for biodiesel production. === Page 23 === Biodiesel composition is possible in the following ways: « Made with fatty acid methyl esters. « Blended with diesel for use in engines. e choice of biodiesel feedstock varies regionally, based availability and suitability. FLeEx Fue. Ano Hysrip Evectric VeHIcLes (HEVs) A flex-fuel engine is an internal combustion engine capable of running on a blend of gasoline and etha- nol, with a maximum ethanol content of 85% (E85). E85 is the official name for flex-fuel. It has 85 per- cent ethanol fuel and 15 percent gasoline or other hydrocarbon by volume. Note that ethanol is a biofuel derived from plants like corn or sugarcane. Fuel Adjustment: Flex-fuel engines are designed to adapt their fuel-air mixture and timing to accom- modate the different properties of gasoline and eth- anol. This adaptability allows them to run smoothly | on various blends of the two fuels. Regional Variations: Flex-fuel engines are more prevalent in certain parts of the world, notably the United States, where E85 fuel stations are widely available. In contrast, they are less common in | regions like Europe and Asia. |. The Environmental Benefits: There will be reduced GHGs courtesy ethanol. There will be reduced reli- ance on foreign oil, so import bills are cut, specially in India. The farmers get additional income. Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) A hybrid car is a type of vehicle that uses a combi- nation of two or more power sources, typically an internal combustion engine (ICE) and an electric motor. There are two variants: Parallel hybrid car: Here, the driver has the option to choose from three combinations — hybrid, ICE or Power Motor. In series option. Series hybrid cars: In a series hybrid car, the elec- tric motor is the primary power source, and the ICE acts as a generator to charge the battery. Overall, hybrid cars offer the benefits of saving money on fuel, quieter operations, reduced main- tenance cost and less emissions. The fuel economy benefits us if electric power is less costly but used more.

Summary:
Jatropha is a non-food, drought-resistant plant ideal for biodiesel production, while flex-fuel engines can run on a blend of gasoline and ethanol, with environmental benefits including reduced GHGs and reliance on foreign oil.

Title: Benefits of Hybrid Cars, Biomass, and Nuclear Energy

Text:
hybrid cars offer the benefits of saving money on fuel, quieter operations, reduced main- tenance cost and less emissions. The fuel economy benefits us if electric power is less costly but used more. ICE is used less time when it is actually required at the times of higher acceleration. Even} when ICE is in operation, electric power will be pro- duced. Thus, overall fuel cost will be less. BioMASS Biomass basically refers to organic materials derived from plants and animals. These materials can be used as a source of energy. Biomass includes things like wood, crop residues (like corn stalks), and even things like manure from animals. This is assumed to be a renewable energy source as they can always grow. This is carbon-neutral in nature. This doesn’t emit greenhouse gases. Biomass is a part of the National Biofuel Policy of India. The Major Renewable Energy Institutes in India 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, New Delhi Solar Energy Corporation of India, New Delhi Nuctear ENERGY Nuclear energy is dense energy. This is derived from the mass of atomic nuclei converted into energy. As discussed, the required nuclear reactions happen in two forms - nuclear fission (splitting of atomic nuclei) or nuclear fusion (combining of atomic nuclei). Einstein’s Formula: Discussed earlier, this formula is a principle behind nuclear energy, Albert Einstein’s equation E = mc’, where ‘E’ is the Energy produced, ‘m’ is the nuclear mass and ‘c’ represents the speed of light in a vacuum. Thus, a small amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy. Ultimately, this energy is then harnessed to generate electricity, typically by heating water to create steam that drives turbines. Major Parts of a Nuclear Reactor 1. 2. Fuel Rods: Contain fissile materials like uranium-235 or plutonium-239 for nuclear fission. Control Rods: Made of neutron-absorbing materials such as boron, hafnium, or cadmium to regulate the nuclear reaction.

Summary:
Hybrid cars offer fuel savings, quieter operations, reduced maintenance costs, and lower emissions, while biomass is a renewable energy source that includes organic materials like wood and crop residues, and nuclear energy is derived from nuclear reactions and harnessed to generate electricity through heating water to create steam.

Contain fissile materials like uranium-235 or plutonium-239 for nuclear fission. Control Rods: Made of neutron-absorbing materials such as boron, hafnium, or cadmium to regulate the nuclear reaction. Moderator: Substances like water, heavy water, or graphite slow down neutrons to facilitate fission. Coolant: Often water, but can be heavy water, liquid sodium, or carbon dioxide gas, used to remove heat from the reactor core. Containment Vessel: Constructed from steel and reinforced concrete to contain radiation and with- stand extreme pressures. Nuclear Fuels used by India 1. Natural uranium: The most common type, it is used in pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs), which account for over 70% of India’s nuclear power genera- tion capacity. === Page 24 === Moderator Rod Fuel Rod Control Rod Concrete Chamber Steel Container Gas Blower Figure 9.15 Nuclear Reactor 2. Enriched uranium (EU): This is used in light water reactors (LWRs). Natural uranium is composed of approximately 0.72% U-235 and 99.28% ura- nium-238 (U-238), a non-fissile isotope. EU is a form of uranium in which the proportion of uranium-235 (U-235), the ‘fissile isotope’, has been increased rela- tive to its natural abundance. Enriching uranium means increasing the concentration of U-235 to a level sufficient to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. EU can be of two types: Low EU: This contains between 3% and 20% U-235. This is used in common nuclear power reactors. Highly EU: The percentage of U-235 is often greater than 20%. This may be used for research and nuclear weapons. This has stringent controls. Depleted Uranium: The waste uranium is known as depleted uranium which is to be safely disposed off in stable geological formations, such as granite or clay or spent fuel casks. Mixed Oxide Fuel (MOX): Plutonium is used in MOX fuel, which is a blend of plutonium and uranium, and can be used in certain types of nuclear reactors to produce energy. MOX fuel is used in prototype fast breeder reactors (PFBRs). Plutonium has a high energy density and can provide fuel for long periods, making it efficient for long-term energy generation. Plutonium can be used to make nuclear weapons also.

Summary:
Nuclear reactors use fissile materials like uranium-235 or plutonium-239, control rods, moderators, coolants, and containment vessels to regulate and facilitate nuclear fission reactions, with India using natural uranium in pressurized heavy water reactors and enriched uranium in light water reactors, as well as mixed oxide fuel containing plutonium for energy generation.

er reactors (PFBRs). Plutonium has a high energy density and can provide fuel for long periods, making it efficient for long-term energy generation. Plutonium can be used to make nuclear weapons also. Thorium as a Nuclear Fuel in India: India has abun- dant reserves of thorium, this fertile material that can be converted into fissile uranium-233. They are yet to see commercial success. India is the largest producer of thorium in the world, that is found in monazite Generator Turbine Heat Exchanger Condenser sand. Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have the largest thorium reserves. Brahmaputra river basin and the Khasi Hills also have rich monazite (and thus thorium) deposits. Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Nagaland are the popular NE states, Use of Heavy Water in Nuclear Reactors: There is pro- duction of neutrons during uranium fission process, they needed to be slowed down for further nuclear fuel (usu- ally uranium) fission. Heavy water performs that function. Slows down neutrons produced during the fission process. A big nuclear power plant might release extra heat into a nearby river or lake. This can make the water too warm, which is harmful to fish and other creatures living in the water. 1.

This suggests that there is a pro- posed geological epoch that recognizes the signifi-. cant impact humans have had on Earth’s geology and 7 ecosystems. These developmental activities initially aimed to improve human living standards, we have advancements in technology and medicine. We can have a look in the following manner: 1. Origin of Life: Life started with single-cell organ- isms around 3 billion years ago. 2. Atmospheric Changes Over Time: There has been a gradual change in levels of gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide over this extensive period with evo- lution, diversity of life, and also population growth. 3. Global Warming, Pollution and Climate Change: There were phenomena of industrialization, urban- ization, deforestation etc. The situation worsened with increase in emission of Green House gases which were heat trapping and led to global warming. 4. Scale and Duration of Changes: These environ- mental changes have grown from being local to having a global impact and have shifted from being short-term disturbances to long-term challenges.

ming. 4. Scale and Duration of Changes: These environ- mental changes have grown from being local to having a global impact and have shifted from being short-term disturbances to long-term challenges. Impact OF ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES ON AGRICULTURE The main impacts on traditional agriculture include deforestation (clearing forests for farming), soil erosion (loss of topsoil from wind or water and depletion of nutri- ents (overuse leads to less fertile soil). === Page 26 === The other key issues are: 1. Micronutrient Imbalance: Too much nitrogen, phos- phorus, and potassium. 1. Nitrate Pollution: Nitrates seep into the soil and contaminate groundwater. When their con- centration exceeds 25 mg/L, they can cause health issues such as blue baby syndrome or methemoglobinemia. Eutrophication: The issue is primarily caused by the excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorus fer- tilizers in agriculture. Figure 9.16 Impact of Anthropogenic Activities * This process has harmful consequences, dam- aging aquatic ecosystems and affecting water quality. * The poor water quality resulting from this issue can be harmful to both wildlife and humans. 2. Pesticide Usage and Irrigation Challenges in Agriculture: Pesticides, including herbicides, insec- ticides, and fungicides, come in various forms: inor- ganic, synthetic, or biological (biopesticides). These are used to control pests and diseases in crops, but they vary in their environmental impact. Waterlogging: This is caused due to agricultural practices such as excess irrigation, where soil is overly saturated with water, that hinders plant growth. Soil salinity: The high levels of soluble salts in the soil, often as the result of the over-irrigation or poor drainage, negatively affect crop health and yield. Housine Sector Retatep Issues ° Sick Building Syndrome: This syndrome is often attrib- ° When these fertilizers are washed into Water bodies, they lead to the overgrowth of algae a phenomenon known as ‘algae bloom’ which blocks sunlight from reaching underwate; plants, which disrupts the aquatic ecosystem. * As the excess algae die and decompose, they consume oxygen in the water, resulting in oxy. gen depletion.

Summary:
Anthropogenic activities, such as deforestation, soil erosion, nutrient imbalance, nitrate pollution, eutrophication, pesticide usage, waterlogging, and soil salinity, have global impacts on agriculture and the environment, leading to harmful consequences for aquatic ecosystems and human health.

Health Risks from Air Conditioning: The growth of bacteria and mould in AC systems can pose health risks. These microorganisms can lead to various respi- ratory issues. Legionnaires’ Disease: A severe pneumonia-like illness caused by bacteria found in AC systems. Symptoms include coughing, shortness of breath, fever, muscle aches, and headaches. Asbestos-Related Diseases: Asbestos is a group. of naturally occurring silicate minerals with thin, fibrous crystals. They are widely used in construction for insulation, roofing, and fireproofing. They are known for resistance to heat, electricity, and chemical corrosion. Their inhalation can cause mesothelioma, asbestosis, and lung cancer. Allergies from Pests: These occur particularly from cockroach droppings, dust mites; and rodent dan- der.

Emission of Gases: Transportation releases gases like lead, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO,), methane (CH,), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrous oxide (N,O), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), perfluorocar- bons (PFCs), heavy metals, and particulates into the atmosphere. Ozone Layer Depletion: Nitrous oxide contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful UV radiation. Greenhouse Effect: CO, CO,, and CH, contribute to the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming. Acid Rain: The interaction of CO, NO,, SO,, NOx with water vapor in the atmosphere leads to acid n attrib- _ rain, which can damage buildings, harm crops, and 7 caused degrade forests. 5. Noise Pollution: Prolonged exposure to noise levels above 75 dB from transportation can impair hearing and affect physical and psychological health. Errects of ANTHROPOGENIC Minine Activities Mining is done primarily to extract minerals, metals, and other valuable materials from the earth. They can be used for manufacturing, construction, energy production, and echnology. Land dredging (creating holes in land) and fiver dredging (moving along a river on a platform or oat). 1. Deforestation: A primary consequence of mining activities. 2. Chemical Usage: Use of harmful chemicals like cya- nide and mercury in mineral extraction. 3. Land and Water Damage: * Degradation of vegetation and landscape alteration. ¢ Land subsidence and a damage (e.g., building cracks). * Groundwater contamination by sulphuric acid and heavy metals. ° Surface water pollution affecting aquatic life, including potential radioactive contamination. 4.

Uranium Mining: Uranium ore emits radon gas and other radioactive elements. Prolonged exposure to high levels of radiation can increase the risk of lung cancer and other health issues. Environmental issues need a global approach with ‘com- mon future’ or ‘global sharing’ concepts. Economic inequalities affect sustainable development worldwide. Environmental concerns differ between developed and developing countries: 1. Local Issues: Such as water shortages, soil erosion, pollution levels, and landslides. 2. Regional Issues: Include desertification, droughts, floods, soil erosion, sea-level rise, and deforestation. 3. Global Issues: Climate change, global warming, the North-South divide, and loss of biodiversity are critical. Agenda 21: This agenda tried to address many environ- mental issues so that is better alignment among different nations for sustainable development. This included differ- ences between North (developed) and South (less devel- oped) Nations. North has technology and capital and South has mineral and other resources. It acknowledges the fact that most of global environmental degradation is caused by North, South is more vulnerable to these envi- ronmental issues. ° Thus, the principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’ is central to Agenda 21. Though all nations have to take responsibility in environmental protection, but developed countries have a larger role to play due to their historical role as industrialisation, urbanisation started in the North nations. ¢ The North has to take responsibility of technology transfer and financial assistance. There is a felt need to enhance the participation of developing countries in the global economy. Their growth should become sustainable and equitable. ° There is need to make sustainable consumption pat- terns across the world. An integrated approach is required towards the issues of environment, sustain- ability, economy and poverty reduction.

Summary:
Environmental issues such as air pollution, occupational health risks for miners, uranium mining, water shortages, soil erosion, climate change, and loss of biodiversity require a global approach with a focus on sustainable development, economic inequalities, and differentiated responsibilities between developed and developing countries.

It may seem that whole unit is built around this. 1. Increase in Atmospheric CO, Concentration: The concentration of CO, in the atmosphere increased significantly due to anthropogenic activities. The excessive use of fossil fuels played its own role. This level has reached 418 ppm now in 2023. During pre- industrial era in 1850's, it was 280 ppm. Thus, there is almost a 50% increase the concentration. 2. Enhanced Greenhouse Effect: CO, acts as a green- house gas, which trap the heat around the earth. The increased use has resulted in an average global tem- perature rise of 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels so far. 3. Consequences of Climate Change: The above resulted in extreme weather patterns, disruption of ecosystems, sea rise and harmful ocean acidification, rapidly melting ice, severe cyclones, biodiversity loss. Mitigation Efforts: They started in the forms of Kyoto Protocols, Paris Agreements etc to limit carbon emis- sions. Then efforts started in the form of renewable energy, reforestation etc. Pollution is the introduction of harmful substances or energy into the environment, resulting in adverse effects on the environment, human health, or the quality of life. These harmful substances, known as pollutants, can be physical, chemical, or biological in nature. They can be introduced into the environment intentionally or uninten- tionally, through human activities or natural processes. Pollutant Levels: As pollutants have toxic effects, their toxicological assessment levels have been given below. They help in setting safety standards: ° NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Level): Used to set safe exposure limits and derive the Benchmark Dose (BMD), which estimates the dose causing a spe- cific level of effect in a population.

Summary:
There is a need for sustainable consumption patterns worldwide, with an integrated approach required to address environmental issues, sustainability, economy, and poverty reduction, particularly focusing on the impact of carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas and the consequences of climate change, along with efforts to mitigate pollution levels through setting safety standards.

The main pollution types have been discussed below: Air PoLtuTtion World Health Organization (WHO) defines air Pollution as ‘the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environ. ment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere, This definition encompasses a wide range of pollut. ants, including gases like sulphur dioxide (SO,), nitrogen oxides (NO,), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (0,), as well as particulate matter (PM), both PM10 and PM2.5 (particulates with diameters of 10 micrometers and 2.5 micrometers, respectively). WHO definition includes diverse sources such as indus. trial activities, vehicles, and natural processes. Pollution affects both indoor and outdoor environments. This can lead to alterations in the atmosphere. There is human contribution in the form of human roles in causing air pollution. Pure Gases The basic idea about pure gases is important as we can compare them with pollutant gases for differentiation. ° Noble Gases: Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), Radon (Rn) - characterized by their chemical inertness (inactivity) due to a full valence electron shell. ° Elemental Gases: Hydrogen (H2), Oxygen (O,), Nitrogen (Nz), Chlorine (Cl,)-consist of diatomic mol- ecules with two atoms of the same element. * Other Gases: Carbon Dioxide (CO), Nitrous Oxide (N20), and Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF,) are also con- sidered pure gases.

Summary:
Various types of standards such as NOAEL, LD50, LOAEL, and NOEFF are used to set safe exposure limits and derive acceptable intake levels for different pollutants, including gases like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and ozone, as well as particulate matter, with human activities contributing to air pollution.

Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) © Source: Emitted from incinerators and various manu- facturing processes. ° Health Effects: Leads to respiratory issues like emphysema, asthma, and chronic bronchitis Acio Rain * Acid Rain pH: Natural rainwater has a pH around 5.6 due to dissolved atmospheric carbon dioxide, forming weak carbonic acid. Acid rain has a pH lower than 5.6. Source of Acid Rain: Emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO,) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from sources like power plants, industries, and vehicles lead to acid rain. ° Formation Process: SO, and NOx react with water vapor, oxygen, and other atmospheric chemicals to produce sulfuric and nitric acids. Let’s see the exam- ple of formation of Sulphuric Acid: Sulphur trioxide (SO3) reacts with water vapor in the atmosphere to form sulphuric acid (H,SO,). This reaction is a key step in the formation of acid rain. * §0,+H,0->H,SO,. Formation of Acid Rain: ® Acid rain is formed when sulphuric acid (from SO3) and nitric acid (formed from nitrogen oxides) dissolve in atmospheric moisture (like rain, fog, snow, or even dry particles). e These acids lower the pH of the precipitation, resulting in acid rain. It can harm lakes, rivers, and forests. It damages for- ests, especially in high places. It makes it hard for trees and plants to grow and stay healthy Smog is a mix of two words ‘smoke’ and ‘fog.’ It describes a type of air pollution that is a combination of smoke, dust, and other particulates with fog. They create a dense layer of visible air pollution. This is mainly of two types: Sulphurous Smog (London Smog) This mainly comprises of sulphur dioxide and PM, which often originates from coal-rich industrial areas.

Summary:
Various industries release harmful chemicals and pollutants into the air, leading to health issues such as pulmonary edema, respiratory problems, and damage to red blood cells and kidneys, as well as the formation of acid rain and smog.

Photochemical Smog (Los Angeles Smog) This smog is a mixture of pollutants, mainly ground level ozone (O,), resulting from sunlight reacting with nitro. gen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from vehicle emissions. This ground-level ozone is specifically formed by sun. light acting on vehicle emission pollutants. This ground level ozone is dangerous while stratospheric ozone is ben. eficial as that protects us from UV radiations. Peroxyacety] Nitrate (PAN): PAN is asecondary pollutant in photochemical smog. It forms from chemical reactions involving VOCs and NOx in sunlight. Emissions from vehj- cles and industries contribute to this pollution. Exposure to PAN and photochemical smog can worsen respiratory and jung conditions like asthma and bronchitis. - Sunlight (Photochemical) Dependence: This forms in sunny, urban areas with heavy traffic due to the need for strong sunlight. Weather Conditions: This appears as a hazy, brownish cloud. This occurs under hot, sunny conditions with stag- nant air. Health Effects: Irritates eyes, throat, and lungs, exacerbat- ing conditions like asthma and chronic bronchitis. Environmental Impact: Harms. crops, vegetation, and materials like rubber and plastics. Los Angeles Connection: This connection appears due to high vehicle emissions and sunny weather contribute to its prevalence.

Summary:
Sulphurous smog, such as the 1952 London smog, is caused by coal-rich industrial areas and traps pollutants close to the ground in cold, humid, and windless conditions, leading to respiratory issues and environmental harm, while photochemical smog, like the Los Angeles smog, is formed by sunlight reacting with vehicle emissions, exacerbating respiratory and lung conditions and harming crops and materials in sunny, urban areas with heavy traffic.

Impact: Harms. crops, vegetation, and materials like rubber and plastics. Los Angeles Connection: This connection appears due to high vehicle emissions and sunny weather contribute to its prevalence. Now observed in urban areas globally with increased vehicle usage and sunny climates. Winter Smog: The winter smog in Delhi has some simi larities with photochemical smog. Winter smog is driven by a temperature inversion when a layer of warm air traps vents the intermixing of gases. Then dangerous PM 2.5 also mixes up. There are hazy and smoggy conditions which obscure the visibility. Overall, winter smog can be particularly dangerous due to the combination of stagnant air, increased pollu- tion sources (e.g., heating), and reduced dispersion of pollutants. That we commonly observe in Delhi during winter months. Photochemical smog, on the other hand, is associated with the chemical reactions between pollutants like nitro- gen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (voCs) in the presence of sunlight. === Page 31 === Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) VyOCs are chemicals that can easily turn into vapours or gases. Examples of common VOCs include formal- | ‘dehyde, benzene, xylene, toluene, and various alco- | hols.

Endocrine Disruption: This is basically inter- 3 ference of VOCs with body’s hormonal systems. Atmospheric haze: This is caused by factors like partic- ulate matter, dust, and pollution, can occur year-round. The situation is compounded by the presence of its fine PM2.5. The extended exposure to PM2.5-rich haze can ead to severe health issues. Government Initiatives to control Air Pollution: There are specific constitutional articles in the Indian Constitution, such as Article 48A (Directive Principles of State Policy) and Article 51A(g) of Fundamental Duties deal with environmental protection. 1. National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP): e Run by the Central Pollution Control Board. * Monitors air quality across India. * Uses the National Air Quality Index (NAQD to make air quality easy to understand. * Measures pollutants like PM10, PM2.5, NO,, SO,, CO, ozone, ammonia, and lead. * The AQI (Air Quality Index) has six categories, from ‘Good’ to ‘Severe’, based on pollution levels. These have been given below: Good (0 -50 - Green): Minimal impact, air quality is satisfactory. Satisfactory (51-100-Yellow): Acceptable air qual- ity, minor concerns for sensitive individuals.

National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS): NAAQS were developed by the Central Pollution Control Board which operates under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in India. NAAQS sets limits for about 12 pollutants.

Summary:
Exposure to industrial solvents like trichloroethylene can lead to central nervous system effects, memory impairment, liver and kidney damage, and endocrine disruption, while government initiatives in India, such as the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme, aim to control air pollution and protect public health.

Title: Air Quality Standards and Regulations in India

Text:
ds (NAAQS): NAAQS were developed by the Central Pollution Control Board which operates under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in India. NAAQS sets limits for about 12 pollutants. These pollutants are typically categorized into ‘crite- ria’ air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO,), nitro- gen dioxide (NO,), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O,), and lead (Pb). NAAQS includes extra pollutants like arsenic, nickel, benzene, and benzopyrene. These sub- stances are known for their carcinogenic and toxic effects. NAAQS has a focus on PM2.5 also due to its severe health risks. These fine particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, causing cardiovascular, respiratory, and other health problems. Efforts such as cleaner fuels and emission norms have reduced SO, and NO, levels. Switching from coal to LPG has helped lower pol- lution. When burned, coal emits a high level of pollutants, including particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO,), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and vari- ous greenhouse gases. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting AFAR): A project by the Ministry of Earth Sciences. Provides real-time air quality information and forecasts in major cities. Developed by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. Also includes weather parameter warnings. Buarat Stace (BS) Norms BS norms set by the government control pollutants from vehicles. These norms are based on European standards (Euro norms). The stages range from Bharat I to VI, with BS VI being the latest. Lead was removed from automobile fuel in 2000. BS VI norms, effective from April 1, 2020, signifi- cantly reduce pollutants: Lower PM 2.5 levels (20 to 40 g/m? in BS-VI compared to 120 pg/m? in BS-IV). Sulphur content reduced to 10 ppm in BS-VI from 50 ppm in BS-IV, reducing particulate matter emissions and engine wear. BS-VI vehicles emit 80% less particulate matter and 70% less nitrogen oxide per kilometer com- pared to previous standards.

Summary:
NAAQS, AFAR, and BS norms in India set limits and standards for pollutants in order to reduce health risks and improve air quality, with efforts such as cleaner fuels and emission norms leading to significant reductions in pollutants emitted by vehicles.

BS-VI vehicles emit 80% less particulate matter and 70% less nitrogen oxide per kilometer com- pared to previous standards. === Page 32 === Indoor Air Pollution e The primary causes are in the forms of inefficient burning of fuels like cow dung, agricultural waste, coal, and wood, especially in poorly ventilated homes. ¢ Problem worsens in winter due to closed doors and windows, particularly in rural areas. ¢ Smokeless chulhas (stoves) were introduced to reduce indoor pollution but had limited success. PSOUICES Figure 9.18 Indoor Air Quality Wain Methods for Controlling Gaseous Pollutants 1. Combustion: Organic gases and vapours are burned to make them less harmful. This process turns pollut- ants into safer substances and water vapor. 2. Absorption: The main role in absorption is played by the liquid within the scrubbers. This soaks up pollutants from gases. The scrubbers have a liq- uid that removes the pollutants, making the air cleaner. 3. Adsorption: Here, pollutants stick to the surface of a solid substance. Gases pass through this solid, leav- ing the pollutants behind and letting clean air pass through. 4. Fabric Filters: Dust and other particles in gases are trapped by passing the gas through fabric filters. 5. Electrostatic Precipitators: These use electrical charges to remove particles from gases, 6. Domestic Measures: Using cleaner fuels like biogas instead of wood or dung cakes. _7. Transportation Measures: Carpooling, using pub- lic transport, using cleaner fuels, regular vehicle - maintenance, and turning off engines when not necessary. 8.

gas that is the Main component of natural gas. Why Methane is so dangerous to us. Methane is basically a greenhouse gas, meaning that it traps heat in the atmosphere and contributes to climate change. Methane is about 25 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide (CO2) over a 20-year periog as its Global Warming Potential (GWP) is 25. A Gwp is a measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere over a specific period, compared tg carbon dioxide. 1. Natural Processes: This includes biologicaj activities and environmental changes. * Biological Activities: Digestion in the diges. tive system, photosynthesis in plants, and cel. lular respiration. ¢ Environmental Changes: Natural events like weathering, erosion, volcanic eruptions, and geological processes like plate tectonics. 2. Human Activities: Man-made sources are diverse and impactful. ¢ Garbage Dumps: Decomposing organic waste generates methane. : * Oil and Gas Systems: Leakage and venting during extraction and processing. ¢ Farming: This happens during rice cultivation that is basically waterlogged conditions. : * Coal Mining: Releases methane trapped within coal layers, that is called as ‘coal bed methane’ (CBM). (Gg ¢ Burning for Energy: Combustion of fossil fuels and biomass releases methane. | * Treating Wastewater: The decomposition 0: organic matter in sewage produces methane... ¢ Factory Processes: Certain chemical and industrial processes emit methane. * Methanogens: An interesting natural source of methane is methanogens, a type of bacteria found in the digestive systems of animals like cows. * Solifluction and Melting Arctic Permafrost: Let’s try to understand this with a question set in UGC NET Exam, on ‘solifluction’. Solifluction primarily occurs in permafrost (frozen ground) in polar or subpolar regions that is affected by the seasonal temperature variations in the soil there. When the permafrost thaws (or loos: ens), there is release of methane. The release of this GHG warns up the planet by trapping the heat. This becomes a positive feedback loop that means more and more release of methane: The students can refer to Green House Gases Emission in the later part.

Summary:
Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere and contributes to climate change, with sources including natural processes like biological activities and environmental changes, as well as human activities such as garbage dumps, oil and gas systems, farming, coal mining, burning for energy, treating wastewater, factory processes, and methane-producing bacteria in the digestive systems of animals.

GHG warns up the planet by trapping the heat. This becomes a positive feedback loop that means more and more release of methane: The students can refer to Green House Gases Emission in the later part. === Page 33 === Feedback Loop: Methane release increases with global warming, which in turn accelerates further methane release. Rising Levels: Over the past two decades, atmo- spheric methane levels have risen sharply. Atmospheric Lifetime: Methane remains in the atmosphere for a shorter duration compared to carbon dioxide. Climate Impact: Effective reduction of meth- ane emissions can significantly decelerate global warming. Major Methane Emitters: Countries like China, USA, Russia, India, Brazil, and Indonesia are lead- ing contributors to global methane emissions. Indication of Life on Planets: The presence of methane on other planets is intriguing because it can potentially indicate the presence of life, but it is not definitive proof. The example is Mars. MONTREAL ProtrocoL (1987)—Manacine Ozone (O,) Ozone, particularly at ground level, is a reactive gas that can be harmful to health. This can cause respiratory such as asthma and lung diseases. At stratospheric level, it works as a protective layer, and saves us from cancer and cataract. Formation of Ozone in Stratosphere Ozone is a triatomic molecule of oxygen, that is O,. When UV radiation strikes an oxygen molecule (O,), it breaks nto two oxygen atoms. or .00127 cms) thick if you could stack all the ozone ina olumn from the Earth’s surface to the top of the atmos- here into one thin layer. Typical Dobson Unit values can range from less than 00 DU in ozone-depleted regions to over 500 DU in areas with higher ozone levels. Montreal Protocol: First, we need to get an idea about he creation of ozone to see how much destruction can be aused., 1. Release of Ozone-Depleting Substances (ODS): Remember from exam point of view that Chloroflu- orocarbons (CFCs), Halons, Carbon Tetrachloride, Methyl Chloroform, and Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are all classified as Ozone-Depleting Sub- stances (ODS). These basically consisted of chlorine and bromine.

Summary:
Greenhouse gases warm up the planet by trapping heat, leading to a positive feedback loop of increasing methane release, with effective reduction of methane emissions being crucial in slowing down global warming, while the Montreal Protocol aims to address the depletion of ozone, which is harmful at ground level but protective in the stratosphere.

FCs), Halons, Carbon Tetrachloride, Methyl Chloroform, and Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are all classified as Ozone-Depleting Sub- stances (ODS). These basically consisted of chlorine and bromine. Note: Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) was envisaged to replace ODS listed above but the release of HFC was found to be dangerous as it proved to be a dangerous GHG with very high Global Warming Potential (GWP). The focus on HFC gave a way to Kigali agreement. 2. Generation of Highly Reactive Atoms: The above go into stratosphere and get broken by UV radiation. Once they are broken down in the form of highly reac- tive chlorine and bromine atoms. 3. ‘Catalytic’ Destruction of Ozone: These highly reac- tive atoms on coming into contact with ozone mol- ecules, destroy them. The End Product: The above reactions lead to the forma- tion of Ozone Holes and there is Increased UV Radiation. Now UV radiations can directly enter the earth and cause cancer, cataract and other diseases. Montreal agreement kept a phasing out schedule for the gradual elimination of ODS, with different timelines for developed and developing countries. Kigali Agreement (2076) As discussed, HFC a tool to reduce ODS under Montreal later proved to be dangerous as it adds to global warming. So, its reduction was mandatory. The reduction in HFCs may be up to 40% by late 2040s as per Kigali agreement. The phase-down of HFCs is expected to avoid up to 0.5°C of warming by the end of the century. The phase out time- line is as follows: e Developed countries (mainly EU and USA) commit- ted to start reducing HFCs as early as 2019. e Developing countries follow with a staggered time- line, beginning either in 2024 or 2028. Water, vital for life, constitutes a significant portion of liv- ing cells (60-95%). Earth, often called the ‘Water Planet,’ holds a mere 1.2% accessible fresh water, including ground ice, lakes, and soil moisture. Demand for water is rising despite its constant volume, compounded by pol- lution challenges. Indeed, gravity plays a pivotal role in the formation and flow of waterfalls within watersheds. The rivers also flow accordingly.

Summary:
Ozone-depleting substances, such as FCs, Halons, and HCFCs, lead to the formation of ozone holes and increased UV radiation, prompting international agreements like the Montreal and Kigali agreements to phase out these harmful substances and reduce their impact on global warming.

Municipal 7% ‘Industri Water pollution, a global concern, affects drinkable water, lakes, rivers, and oceans. It involves the contamination of water bodies with harmful substances, rendering the water unfit for its intended use. === Page 34 === Key Characteristics of Drinking Water Quality 1. Taste and Odor: Water should be palatable — pleasant taste and no odour. The presence of chlorine (used for disinfection), algae, some bacteria, sulphates etc. can cause off-tastes or odours. The temperature of water can be linked with growth of microorganisms. 2. Colour: The presence of substances like iron, manga- nese, and certain organic compounds can cause contami- nation and provide somewhat bad colour to water. There can be turbidity issues in water due to pathogens etc. 3. Hardness: This happens asa result of high levels of min- erals like calcium and magnesium. This affects tastes of water, and cause scaling in pipes and appliances. 4. pH Level: Environment Protect Agency recommends a range of 6.5 (slightly acidic) to 8.5 (slightly alka- line) for pH levels in water. Slightly alkaline (a higher concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) than hydro- gen ions (H+)) is good for improved digestion, better hydration, and detoxification. High levels of acidic or basic may result in corrosion, scaling, and contamina- tion may be the results. Dissolved Oxygen and BOD: These have been dis- cussed under BOD and COD, discussed separately. 6. Nitrate/Nitrite Levels: Their high levels can be par- ticularly hazardous for infants and pregnant women, as they can interfere with blood oxygen levels. 7. Chemical Safety: Too much of metals and heavy met- als are bad for health. WHO recommends the follow- ing levels per litre. 1.5 mg/L Chromium Mercury 6 pg/L Copper 8.

Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): This refers to the com- bined content of all organic and inorganic substances dissolved in water, including minerals, salts, and some organic matter. TDS affects the taste and quality of water, with the following general observations: ¢ Low TDS: Water with low TDS levels (below 300 mg/L) may have a flat or insipid taste. * Moderate TDS: Levels of TDS between 300 to 600 mg/L can enhance the taste of water, making it more palatable. * High TDS: When TDS levels exceed 1000 mg/L, water may develop a bitter, salty, or metallic taste, and might not be suitable for drinking. Types of Water PoLLution 1. Point Source Pollution: * Results from specific discharge locations, like industrial wastewater and thermal power plant effluent. ¢ Major sources include: (i) Industrial Wastewater: Contains a mix of organic and inorganic pollutants, signifi- cantly contributing to river pollution. Gi) Hot Water: Used as coolant in industries. its discharge raises water temperatures, dis. rupting oxygen solubility and fish Metabo. lism, thereby altering river ecosystems, 2. Non-point Source Pollution: * Occurs from diffuse sources over large areas, such as construction runoff and acid rain. ¢ Key contributors include: (i) Municipal Wastewater: From domestic sources, a significant factor in river pollution. Gi) Surface Run-off: Agricultural practices cause fertilizers and pesticides to leach into ground. water, affecting its quality. Industrial presence exacerbates this issue. | (iii) Oil Spills: Accidental petroleum discharges from capsized tankers or oil drilling pollute marine ecosystems.

amount of oxygen is required to break down chemicals in the water? When this number is high, it usually means the water is highly polluted, and that is a bad news for plants and animals living in it. Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD): * BOD measures the amount of oxygen (in an aquatic system) that microorganisms will consume to break down organic matter present in water. It also indi- cates the amount of biodegradable organic material in water, ¢ BOD typically involves a 5-day testing period. ° Lower BOD values suggest less organic pollution. Higher BOD means death warrant for fish, molluscs and phytoplankton. : ° More relevant to assessing the impact on aquatic life. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): ¢ COD measures the total amount of oxygen required to oxidize ‘both organic and inorganic’ substances in water. There may be chemical reactions also to decompose the pollutants. * COD is faster process which can be completed in few hours.

Summary:
High levels of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) in water indicate high pollution levels, which can be harmful to plants and animals living in the water, and can lead to bioaccumulation and biomagnification of toxins in the food chain.

They nd to lose electrons and form positive ions in chemical reactions. The examples.are Iron, copper, silver, gold, alu- Minium, sodium etc. While heavy metals are a subset of metals character- ized by their high atomic weight or high atomic number, and a density at least five times greater than water. Lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic (though technically a metalloid) are commonly cited examples. Note: The health issues relating to metals and heavy Metals fall under both water and solid waste, depending Upon the context.

Title: Sources and Health Impacts of Heavy Metals: Focus on Aluminium and Arsenic

Text:
and arsenic (though technically a metalloid) are commonly cited examples. Note: The health issues relating to metals and heavy Metals fall under both water and solid waste, depending Upon the context. Sources of Metal & Heavy Metal Contamination ndustrial Discharge: Factories involved in mining, Metal plating, battery manufacturing, tanneries, and chemical production often release heavy metals into water bodies. Agricultural Runoff: Pesticides and fertilizers can con- tain heavy metals like arsenic, cadmium, and lead, which leach into water sources. Municipal Waste: Improperly managed landfill sites and sewage can contribute to heavy metal contamination. Natural Sources: Certain rocks and soils naturally con- tain heavy metals which can leach into water bodies, especially in areas of mining activities. Atmospheric Deposition: Air pollution from industrial processes can deposit heavy metals into water bodies via rain. Impact oF Heavy MevTALS ON HUMAN HEALTH 1. Aluminium: Main Parts Affected: Bones, Kidneys, Brain, Liver, Musculoskeletal system and Nervous sys- tem. Aluminium is a naturally occurring element that is found in many foods, drinking water, and the envi- ronment. The blood stream distributes Aluminium to different body parts. ¢ Aluminium Toxicity: Excessive exposure through through certain antacids or occupational settings is associated with neurotoxicity. The potential effects are: e Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease: These are neurodegenerative diseases. * Bone Loss and Osteoporosis: Aluminium can interfere with calcium metabolism in bones. ¢ Blood problems: such as anaemia where the blood does not have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. 2. Arsenic: Main Parts Affected: Skin, liver, lungs, bladder Arsenic is a metalloid, which means it exhibits proper- ties of both metals and non-metals. This characteristic influences its behaviour in groundwater. As a metal- loid, arsenic compounds, including certain acids, can be more soluble and mobile in aqueous environments than elemental arsenic. The excess intake through solubility leads to ‘arsenic poisoning’ which makes them fatal.

Summary:
Heavy metals, including arsenic, can contaminate water sources through industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, municipal waste, natural sources, and atmospheric deposition, leading to health issues such as neurotoxicity, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, bone loss, osteoporosis, and blood problems.

The excess intake through solubility leads to ‘arsenic poisoning’ which makes them fatal. * Skin Problems: hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin), hypopigmentation (lightening of the skin), and the development of skin lesions such as warts and corns. These skin changes are often _ referred to as ‘arsenic keratoses.’ ¢ Cardiovascular Issues: such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. , * Cancers: such as of skin, lung, bladder. 3. Cadmium: Main parts affected: Kidneys, lungs, bones. Smoking is a direct source of cadmium exposure, and passive or secondary smoking also contributes to this exposure. === Page 36 === e Itai-Itai Disease: Itai-Itai disease, known as ‘it hurts-it hurts’ in Japanese, is characterized by kidney damage and bone disorders. ¢ Chronic Bronchitis: Cadmium exposure can lead to chronic bronchitis, a condition characterized by persistent inflammation and damage to the airways. ¢ Osteoporosis: Cadmium can disrupt calcium metabolism in bones, resulting in reduced bone density. * Carcinogen: Cadmium is classified as a carcino- gen, linking it to an increased risk of cancer. » Chromium: Main Parts Affected: Skin, lungs, respira- tory system Chromium, particularly in its hexavalent form (Chromium-6), can have adverse effects on the body. It primarily affects:. Skin: skin irritation and dermatitis. Lungs and Respiratory System: Hexavalent chro- mium is a known carcinogen resulting in nasal and sinus cancers. Gastrointestinal System: A loss to digestion that results in symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, con- stipation, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Copper: Main Parts Affected: Liver, kidneys, brain The copper overload is also called as Wilson’s disease that is a genetic disorder that results in the accumula- tion of excess copper in the body. This happens due to impaired copper metabolism. This can lead to liver damage, neurological symptoms, and other health issues. Iron: The most important physiological function is the formation of haemoglobin in red blood cells, which is crucial for oxygen transport.

Summary:
Excessive intake of certain soluble compounds, such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, and iron, can lead to various health issues including skin problems, cardiovascular issues, cancers, kidney damage, bone disorders, chronic bronchitis, osteoporosis, and liver damage.

Mottling of teeth, also known as dental ‘fluorosis’, is caused by excessive fluoride intake. The excessive fluoride causes dental and skeletal fluorosis. sewage, and industrial waste. They can contaminate drinking water. These nitrates convert into ‘nitrites’ once they enter the human body. They can interfere with the blood’s ability to carry oxygen, causing a lack of oxygen, which results in a blue tint to the body. This condition is known as ‘blue baby syndrome’ or ‘methemoglobinemia’. Errect on Manine Lire Marine Oil Spills: These spills cover the surface of water hus, they prevent oxygen dissolution in water, harming marine organisms. Oil-coated marine birds suffer from hypothermia and survival challenges.

aining high standards in environmental con- servation, safety, and facilities for tourists ational River Linking Project (NRLP): India has pro- ects connecting river basins with canals and reservoirs. They’re for irrigation, drinking, and industry. Examples: -Ken-Betwa for Bundelkhand, Godavari-Krishna for Andhra - Pradesh/Telangana, Mahanadi-Godavari- Krishna-Pennar-Cauvery. There is a project Mission _Bhagirath in Telangana that will interlink river Bhagirathi with river Krishna. netals. Soit Pottution We discussed lithosphere earlier where soil is the main ycome — constituent. Soil is the top layer of the earth’s surface, con- jewel: sisting of rock and mineral particles mixed with organic S. Matter. It forms the substrate for plant growth and is a which | Nitrates: Nitrates are commonly found in fertilizers, | critical component of terrestrial ecosystems, playing a key role in water filtration, nutrient cycling, and supporting a wide range of microbial and animal life. Main Features of Soil The soil produces food for all. The following are the main factors and features of good soil: 1. The Formation of Desirable Quality Soil: This should be rich in essential components like silicates, organic material, humus, and clay. The process is so gradual that it takes thousands of years to form through natural processes. 2. Dynamic Soil Ecosystem: This is required for proper thrive, so that it plays a vital role in nutrient cycling. That includes the absorption of atmospheric nitrogen in the form of nitrates by nitrifying bacteria, which are essential for plant growth. 3. Gas Exchange with the Environment: Soil plays a role in breaking down organic waste and recycling nutrients back to plants, while also exchanging gases with the environment. Soil Horizons Mature soil is arranged into a series of zones called soil horizons. The four main soil horizons are: ¢ O horizon: This is the topmost layer of soil and is made up of freshly fallen leaves, twigs, animal waste, and fungi. ° A horizon: This layer is made up of partially decom- posed organic matter (humus) and some inorganic mineral particles.

Summary:
The National River Linking Project in India aims to connect river basins for irrigation, drinking, and industry, while maintaining high standards in environmental conservation and safety for tourists, with a focus on interlinking rivers like Ken-Betwa, Godavari-Krishna, and Mahanadi-Godavari-Krishna-Pennar-Cauvery, and emphasizing the importance of soil in supporting plant growth and nutrient cycling through factors like gas exchange and soil horizons.

Types of Soil We have taken a wholesome view of the soil types in India from examination point of view. The first six are the most basic types, the rest four are the popular region wise. 1. Sandy Soil: Found in regions with low rainfall and well-drained areas, including parts of Rajasthan, Guja- rat, Punjab, Haryana, and some parts of Uttar Pradesh. 2. Clay Soil: Found in regions with good rainfall, more prevalent in the eastern and northeastern parts of India, including parts of West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, and Odisha. Silty Soil: Often found in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, including states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal. Also found in delta regions of rivers. 4. Peaty Soil: Typically found in wetlands and marshy areas in parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and the northeastern states. 5. Loamy Soil: Relatively widespread in India, found in various regions, including the Indo-Gangetic Plains, parts of Central India, and the Deccan Plateau. === Page 38 === 6. Chalky Soil: Less common in India but found in hilly and limestone-rich areas, such as parts of the Himalayan region and certain regions in the southern states. 7. Alluvial Soil: ¢ Formed due to flooding of plain areas, particu- larly in lower courses of rivers. ¢ Sedimentary rocks, very fertile, often lacks humus and nitrogen but rich in potassium. ¢ Suitable for crops like paddy and sugarcane, com- monly found in the Indo-Gangetic Plains. 8. Red Soil: * Rich in iron, characterized by its red colour. ¢ Formed from the breakdown of igneous and met- amorphic rocks. ¢ Found in regions with low rainfall, including Madhya Pradesh, South Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. * Suitable for crops like red gram, groundnut, and castor seed.

Summary:
Different types of soil in India include sandy soil, clay soil, silty soil, peaty soil, loamy soil, chalky soil, alluvial soil, and red soil, each with specific characteristics and regions where they are found.

Acidic Soils: with pH level below 7. The examples are sandy soils and some types of peaty soils. The low pH value is due to the leaching of basic nutrients and the accumulation of acidic substances over time. 2. Neutral Soils: with pH level of 7. Example is loamy soils. Soil is neither strongly acidic nor strongly alkaline. 3. Alkaline Soils: with pH level above 7. Example is chalky soils which contains a large amount of chalk or limestone. The alkaline level is due to the presence of calcium carbonate. Bad Management of Soils Soil pollution refers to the presence of toxic chemicals, salts, pathogens, or radioactive materials in soil at levels harmful to plant growth, human health, and ecosystem function. The sources of pollution include the following: }. Deforestation Impact: Deforestation disrupts the soil ecosystem, leading to adverse effects on soil health and fertility. So, this must be avoided. 2. Soil Compaction: The use of heavy machinery cg compact the soil, reducing its porosity and wate holding capacity. 3. Sewage Water and Heavy Metals: Irrigating fielq with sewage water or using sewage sludge as fertilize can increase the heavy metal content in the soil. 4.

Summary:
Different types of soils in India include red soil, laterite soil, and regur soil, each with their own characteristics and suitable crops, with issues such as soil pollution from deforestation, soil compaction, and sewage water contamination needing to be addressed.

Groundwater Overexploitation: Overexploitation of groundwater can lead to a declining water table. and contribute to desertification. The bad waste disposal practices, air borne pollution, non-biodegradable waste, radioactive waste, open cast mining (linked with top soil) and e-Wastes can be taken. as other points. Effects of Soil Pollution Soil pollution is sometimes known as Land Pollution. The major effects can be following: ® Reduced soil fertility : © Contamination of food and water: This can lead to. health issues. ¢ Loss of biodiversity * Climate change: This may happen due to release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Prevention of Soil Pollution 1. Sustainable Agricultural Practices: There should be organic farming methods, rotating crops, and reduc- ing the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. 2. Proper Waste Disposal: To ensure safe disposal and treatment of industrial and municipal waste. 3. Soil Remediation Techniques: This includes meth- ods such as bioremediation, phytoremediation, and soil washing to remove contaminants. 4. Legislation and Policies: Implementing and enforc- ing environmental regulations to control the dis- charge of pollutants into the soil. 5.

Summary:
Soil pollution can lead to reduced fertility, contamination of food and water, loss of biodiversity, and climate change, but can be prevented through sustainable agricultural practices, proper waste disposal, soil remediation techniques, and legislation and policies.

Some POP may be linked with soil pollution as they get suitable conditions to stay there for longer dura- tions. POP can be divided into three parts: | Persistent means staying longer in the environment without breaking down. / Organic means they are carbon based molecules their structure may involve chlorine, fluorine, or bro- mine. There is exposure to pesticides; herbicides etc due to agriculture practices and also industrial wastes Pollutants means their capability to damage nerv ous system, immune system cause cancer etc. They bioaccumulate and biomagnify in the food chain because they stay longer in the trophic levels. They are specially dangerous to high trophic levels such as human beings as they stay in the fatty acids. There is need for better regulations to avoid thei intakes into the trophic levels.

Effects of Noise Pollution: Noise pollution not only impacts hearing but also raises blood pressure, impairs cognitive function, and leads to chronic stress, affect- ing the ing overall health. jon and Measurement of Noise: Noise is measured in decibels (dB), that was named after Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone. This measurement is not linear but logarithmic: cleaner yl mea-. ° Decibel Scales: Noise levels are measured in deci- il struc- 3s: Ih 21S ar bels (dB), which is a logarithmic scale. Every 10 dB cially at high volumes or with prolonged exposure. © increase represents a tenfold increase in sound inten- sity. For example, 70 dB is ten times more intense than 60 dB. An increase from 40 to 80 dB signifies a 10,000-fold rise in loudness. ° Threshold of Hearing: The threshold of hearing is the quietest sound that the average human ear can detect, typically around 0 dB. Sounds below this level are considered inaudible. O decibel represents the threshold of hearing, correlating to an intensity of 1 X 10°? Watts/m?. e Threshold of Pain: On the other end of the scale, the threshold of pain for most people is around 120- 130 dB. Exposure to sounds at or above this level can cause physical discomfort and hearing damage. e Sonic Boom: An aircraft flying at or above the speed of sound generates a shockwave known as a sonic boom. This creates an extremely loud noise heard on the ground. e dBA: The decibel-A scale (dBA) is used to measure noise pollution, and it considers both the intensity (loudness) and frequency (pitch) of sounds. The weighting in the dBA scale is designed to mimic the sensitivity of the human ear to different frequencies. ° Sound power: This is measured in watts (W) and rep- resents the total energy radiated by a sound source.

Summary:
Noise pollution is unwanted sound that can harm the body, particularly the ears, and can lead to various health issues such as raised blood pressure, impaired cognitive function, and chronic stress, with noise being measured in decibels (dB) on a logarithmic scale.

the dBA scale is designed to mimic the sensitivity of the human ear to different frequencies. ° Sound power: This is measured in watts (W) and rep- resents the total energy radiated by a sound source. As per the Environment Protection Rules, 1999, in India, the permissible noise level is set at 125 dB. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) specifies different noise limits for various zones, both during the day and night: Industrial areas 75 dB 70GB Commercial areas 65 dB 55 dB Residential areas 55 dB 45 dB ‘Silent zones’ near 50 dB 40 dB schools, hospitals, etc. Hearing Loss and Masking: WHO recognizes noise as a significant health hazard in crowded cities. Persistent exposure to noise, even below 85 dB, can cause permanent hearing loss, and levels around 130 dB can induce physi- cal pain. Noise pollution also leads to ‘masking’, affecting our ability to hear important environmental cues, and can cause heart rate and breathing pattern changes, irritabil- ity, headaches, sleeplessness, and decreased productivity.

The silence zones are areas near educational institutions, vicinity of hospitals, courts and religious places. The permissible noise levels in these areas during the daytime (6:00 AM to 10:00 PM) are up to 50 dB, and during the night time (10:00 PM to 6:00 AM), the limit is up to 40 dB. RADIOACTIVE POLLUTION Radioactive pollution refers to the presence of radioac- tive substances in the environment, which can be harm- ful to living organisms and the ecosystem. Radiation, the transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or a material medium, is categorized into ionizing and non-ionizing types. lonizing Radiation * Includes high-energy radiation like X-rays and gamma rays. ® Can alter DNA and is harmful due to its ability to ion- ize atoms and molecules.

stainable process that trans- forms waste into valuable organic input, enhanc- ing soil vitality, root growth, and soil moisture retention. ¢ The objective is to collect organic waste exclusively. ‘2. Biomethanation: Biomethanation involves the pro- duction of biogas from organic waste. 3. Heat Energy Recovery: Recovering heat energy in the form of dry fuels from combustible wag; fractions. Types of Composting Units Composting units can be categorized into the followin, methods: : 1. Aerobic Composting: e This involves the bacterial conversion of organic. in solids under the presence of air, hot, and mo conditions. ¢ This produces compost (humus) that serves g odourless and pathogen-free fertilizer. e This reduces waste volume by 50-85%. e This can be carried out using either manual oy mechanical means. : 2. Vermicomposting: ° This relies on the joint action of earthworms an aerobic microorganisms. e This produces fine, odourless, granular wor castings, which can be used as biofertilizers in agriculture. 3. Anaerobic Digestion: e This occurs when organic waste is buried in pit under partially anaerobic conditions. ue e Anaerobic microorganisms break down the waste releasing methane and carbon dioxide. e The remaining organic residue becomes valuabl manure. e Although slower than aerobic composting, §it occurs naturally in landfills. * This can lead to energy recovery through biogas generation, containing. 55-60% methane, suit- able for power generation. : ° Less attractive in India due to high moisture and organic content, along with the low calorific value of the waste. ° Challenges, such as those faced by the Lucknow biomethanation plant in 1990, highlight the importance of designing facilities to handle mixed waste effectively. The other strategies have been discussed below: 1. Incineration: This process involves burning waste at high temperatures, where the 80-90% volume reduc- tion takes place. The generated heat can be converted into electricity or this can be directly used for heating purpose. This can be assumed as a source of renew- able energy. ¢ Benefit: That lies in reducing landfill space and can handle certain types of hazardous waste.

r this can be directly used for heating purpose. This can be assumed as a source of renew- able energy. ¢ Benefit: That lies in reducing landfill space and can handle certain types of hazardous waste. The initial cost and maintenance of incineration plants are high. There can be emission of GHGS _ and other pollutants. We may use advanced filter ing systems to avoid this. === Page 3 === Landfill: The waste is buried in designated areas " known as landfills. Modern landfills are engineered with liners and other protective measures to minimize environmental impact. e Risk: The decomposition of organic waste pro- duces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Landfills can also lead to leachate, a contaminated liquid that can pollute groundwater and soil. _e Management: This requires careful site selec- tion, design, operation, and closure to minimize environmental impact. Gas collection systems can capture methane for energy use. Recycling: The process involves collecting, sorting, and processing waste materials like plastic, paper, glass, and metals to manufacture new products. ¢ Benefits: This includes reducing the need for raw materials, saves energy, decreases greenhouse gas emissions, and conserves landfill space. The main challenge lies in the fact recycling rates vary by material and region. It requires public participa- tion and efficient collection systems. Some materials lose quality over recycling cycles. Bioremediation: The process utilizes microorgan- isms, fungi, or plants to detoxify or remove pollutants from soil, water, or air. ° Benefits: Bioremediation helps in case of oil spills, chemical contaminants, heavy metals, organic pollutants etc. This can be in situ (on site) and ex-situ (off site). This is cost effective also. Limitations: The effective depends on the type of pollutant, concentration, and environmental conditions. It is generally slower than physical or chemical methods. ethanogenesis thanogenesis is closely linked to the production of jiogas, commonly known as ‘gobar gas’ in India.

Summary:
Various methods of waste management, including incineration, landfill, recycling, and bioremediation, have benefits and limitations in terms of reducing environmental impact and conserving resources.

nd environmental conditions. It is generally slower than physical or chemical methods. ethanogenesis thanogenesis is closely linked to the production of jiogas, commonly known as ‘gobar gas’ in India. This is biological process in which microorganisms, known as ethanogens, produce methane (CH,) as a metabolic yproduct during the decomposition of organic matter in maerobic (oxygen-free) environments. Methane produced through methanogenesis can be a otent greenhouse gas and also serves as a valuable energy ource when harnessed, such as in biogas production. YROLYSIS yrolysis involves the following two steps: nverted heating ‘renew- 1. Pyrolysis. involves heating organic materials, such as biomass (wood, crop residues, etc.) or waste materi- als, to high temperatures. This heating is done in an oxygen-free (anaerobic) environment to prevent com- ace and bustion. ste. » Then ‘decomposition’ of larger organic material hap- reration pens into smaller ones which are the following: if GHGs (i) Solid (Char or Biochar): A carbon-rich solid id filter- residue remains. This can be used as a fuel or as a soil amendment. Gi) Liquid (Bio-oil): A dense, viscous liquid is pro- duced, which can be refined further to produce fuels or chemicals. Gii) Gas (Syngas): The gaseous products include a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. This syngas can be used as a fuel or as a feedstock for producing chemicals. Syngas can be further processed to separate and purify the ‘hydrogen’ that can be used as a clean energy source. Keeping in view the above discussion, there are two waste management approaches: ¢ Centralized: Incineration, gasification, pyrolysis ° Decentralized: Biomethanation, vermicomposting Other Suggestible Points for Solid Waste Management e Segregation and community participation are essen- tial for effective waste management. ° There are two main methods of waste management: waste reduction and recycling.

Summary:
Biological methanogenesis and pyrolysis are two methods of waste management that can produce valuable energy sources while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with community participation and waste reduction/recycling being essential components of effective waste management.

Title: Challenges and Solutions in Solid Waste Management: Importance of Segregation and Community Participation

Text:
ts for Solid Waste Management e Segregation and community participation are essen- tial for effective waste management. ° There are two main methods of waste management: waste reduction and recycling. * In 2000, the Government implemented the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, man- dating urban local bodies to manage waste through collection, segregation, storage, transportation, pro- cessing, and disposal. ° Major challenges in waste management include: Gi) Lack of segregation at the source Gi) Insufficient funding (iii) Shortage of technical expertise and appropriate institutional arrangements (iv) Lack of public participation ° The Kasturirangan Report emphasizes the need for an integrated waste management approach based on the 5 R’s: Reduce, Reuse, Recover, Recycle. Remanufacture PLastic Waste We specifically observe this issue in India but situation improved somewhat after Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan (Clean India Mission) was launched in 2014 by Government of India. The main points are as follow: i. The entire life cycle of plastics, from manufacturing to disposal, poses a significant environmental challenge. 2. It contributes to the degradation of land, making it unsightly and unhygienic. Plastic waste deteriorates soil fertility and can persist in the soil for extended periods, disrupting essential soil microbe activity. 3. Plastics have the potential to clog drains, causing drainage issues. 4. Plastic waste has been linked to reproductive problems. Release of Dioxins ° Plastic manufacturing, particularly of PVC (polyvi- nyl chloride) can be detrimental to us. Through PVC, there can be release of dioxins and furans, which are very toxic and can cause cancer, === Page 4 === ° As discussed, dioxins are a type of POPs are known for their ability to remain in the environment for a long time and accumulate in the food chain. This build-up poses significant risks to both humans and wildlife. e The release of these toxic substances into the atmo- sphere exacerbates environmental pollution. Dioxins can be transmitted to nursing infants through breast milk. Thus, they highlight the potential harm to vul- nerable populations.

Summary:
Effective waste management, including segregation and community participation, is essential to address the challenges of waste reduction and recycling, with the Kasturirangan Report emphasizing the 5 R's approach, while the release of toxic substances like dioxins from plastic waste poses significant environmental and health risks, particularly in India where initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan have been implemented to improve the situation.

Process of the Greenhouse Effect e Solar Radiation: The Sun emits shortwave radiation, passing through Earth’s atmosphere and absorbed by the Earth’s surface. e Earth’s Emission: Earth then radiates this energy back as longwave (infrared) radiation. © Role of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs): Greenhouse gases inthe atmosphere absorb some of this longwave radiation and re-emit it in all directions, including back to Earth. Heat Trapping and Blanket Effect e Heat Trapping: This re-emission of longwave radia- tion back to Earth is what traps heat in the atmosphere. ¢ Natural Warming: Without this effect, Earth’s aver- age temperature would be about -18°C. e Enhancement by Greenhouse Gases: The green- house effect raises Earth’s average temperature by approximately 33°C, leading to a more hospitable average surface temperature of around 14-15°C. e Blanket Effect: GHGs act like an atmospheric blan- ket, absorbing and re-emitting infrared radiation, which plays a crucial role in maintaining Earth’s temperature.

Summary:
India’s amended Plastic Waste Management Rules in 2023 include a deposit return scheme for plastic products, mandatory Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for all plastic manufacturers, and a separate category for biodegradable plastics.

d prominently in recent decades. Primary Cause: Largely due to human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation, leading to an increase in heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Impact: Leads to altered weather patterns, forming a significant aspect of climate change. The terms ‘global warming’ and ‘climate change’ are closely related but distinct. auses of Climate Change The causes have been divided into two parts — natural and nthropogenic. \JATURAL CAUSES ach of the natural phenomena plays a crucial role in haping Earth’s climate. Understanding them is vital in he study of both past and present climatic changes. 1. Continental Drift * Continental drift is the gradual movement of Earth’s continents over geological time. ¢ Pangaea Breakup: This has been discussed under earthquakes in natural hazards. * Impact on Climate: The movement of continents affects ocean currents and atmospheric circula- tion patterns, which in turn influence climate. For instance, when continents move closer to the poles, they become covered with ice, reflecting more sunlight and affecting global temperatures. Volcanic Activity * Volcanoes emit sulphur dioxide (SO,), water vapor, dust, and ash into the atmosphere. * Cooling Effect: These particles, especially sul- phur dioxide, can reach the stratosphere where they combine with water to form aerosols. These aerosols reflect sunlight back into space, leading to a cooling effect on the planet’s surface. ¢ Historical Examples: Significant volcanic erup- tions, like Mount Pinatubo in 1991, have been followed by measurable decreases in global temperatures. te! The global warming level has reached 418 parts per million (ppm), compared to 280 ppm in the pre-industrial 3. Earth’s Tilt and Orbit ¢ The Earth is tilted at an angle of about 23.5° rela- tive to its orbit around the sun. This tilt causes the seasonal variations we experience. e Orbital Changes: Additionally, Earth’s orbit is slightly elliptical, causing variations in the distance between the Earth and the sun over the year.

Summary:
Human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation have led to an increase in heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, altering weather patterns and contributing to climate change, while natural causes such as continental drift, volcanic activity, and Earth's tilt and orbit also play a role in shaping Earth's climate.

ilt causes the seasonal variations we experience. e Orbital Changes: Additionally, Earth’s orbit is slightly elliptical, causing variations in the distance between the Earth and the sun over the year. ¢ Climatic Impact: Variations in Earth’s tilt and orbit over thousands of years (Milankovitch cycles) can lead to significant long-term climate changes, such as ice ages and interglacial periods. 4, Ocean Currents ¢ Solar Radiation Absorption: Oceans cover about 71% of Earth’s surface and absorb a large amount of solar radiation. ¢ Heat Distribution: Ocean currents act as a global conveyor belt, distributing heat around the planet. For example, the Gulf Stream carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Atlantic, influencing the climate of Western Europe. * Climate Influence: These currents can signifi- cantly affect climate patterns. Changes in ocean currents can lead to climate changes such as the El Nifio and La Nifia phenomena. Anthropogenic Causes (Human Causes): These have been discussed separately in the earlier parts also. ° Urbanization and Industrialization: These are powered by fossil fuels, contributing significantly to global warming and climate change. ° Electricity Production: Mainly generated from coal- fired thermal power plants, which are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Errects of Cuimare CHANGE AND GLOBAL WARMING The effects of climate change and global warming are extensive and varied, impacting nearly every aspect of the Earth’s environment and human life. Cyclonic Storms e Increased Storm Activity: There is notable rise in both the frequency and intensity of tropical storms in recent years. e Formation Mechanism: These storms develop due to ocean water evaporation and are influenced by the Coriolis effect, which causes them to spin. e Cyclones or Hurricanes: When such storms reach wind speeds over 119 km/h, they are classified ‘as hurricanes. e Ice Storms: These occur when precipitation falls as ice, often due to specific atmospheric conditions. Loss of Biodiversity e Habitat Destruction: A significant impact is the loss of habitats, essential for countless species. === Page 10 === 1.

Summary:
Earth's tilt and orbit, along with ocean currents and human activities, contribute to climate change and global warming, leading to a variety of effects such as increased storm activity and loss of biodiversity.

Loss of Biodiversity e Habitat Destruction: A significant impact is the loss of habitats, essential for countless species. === Page 10 === 1. Forest Ecosystems: Around 70% of land animals and plants reside in forests, and deforestation leads to biodiversity loss and species extinction. 2. Forest Value: Forests are crucial for biodiver- sity, wildlife habitat, and medicinal resources. Deforestation risks losing unique genetic resources. 3. Species Extinction Rates: Reports suggest that up to 50,000 species are lost each year, a concern raised during the 1992 Earth Summit. Sea-Level Rise and Ocean Changes ¢ Ocean’s Role in Climate: Oceans absorb CO,, miti- gating atmospheric CO, levels, but increased CO, leads to ocean acidification. ¢ Warming Effects: Rising ocean temperatures affect their ability to absorb CO, and lead to thermal expan- sion, contributing to sea-level rise. e Melting of Ice: Melting glaciers and ice sheets further contribute to rising sea levels. ® Ocean Circulation Changes: Potential large-scale changes in ocean currents could occur, affecting global climate patterns. Coral Reefs Bleaching ¢ Importance of Coral Reefs: Known as ‘rainforests of the oceans,’ they provide diverse habitats and protect coastlines. ° Impact of Warming Oceans: Increased sea tem- peratures and changes in water conditions lead to decreased photosynthesis in algae, essential for coral health. This results in coral bleaching, where corals lose color and vitality. Additional Marine Impacts * Polar Ice Melting: Affects marine ecosystems and sea levels. , ° Fish Migration: Changes in ocean temperatures lead to shifts in marine species distribution. Overall, climate change and global warming have diverse and profound impacts on the planet, affecting weather patterns, ecosystems, biodiversity, and marine life. OtTHer Key DEVELOPMENTS 1. 1896-Arrhenius’ Fossil Fuel Warning: Svante Arrhenius predicts that burning fossil fuels could enhance global warming. He notes that only half of CO, emissions are naturally absorbed, with the rest accumulating in the atmosphere. 2.

Summary:
Climate change, caused by factors such as deforestation and ocean warming, has significant impacts on biodiversity, habitats, and marine ecosystems, leading to species extinction, coral bleaching, and rising sea levels.

Title: Tipping Point and Runaway Climate Change

Text:
t. Tiprinc Point anp Runaway Cuimate CHances Tipping point logically appears before runaway climate changes. Tipping point is a threshold point beyond which. uncontrollable runaway changes will occur. We can play an analogy between the term ‘tipping point’ and ‘playing with fire’ that means that if we keep warming the Earth, we might reach a point where big and unstoppable cli- mate changes happen. The changes which could not be controlled are known as runaway changes. Thus, the ini- tial small anthropogenic aggravate into big uncontrolla- ble changes. Thus, once tipping points are crossed, they can lead to runaway climate change. tant ir For Example: The melting of ice at Arctic and Antarctic may happen after increase of temperature by 1.5 to 2°C to reach at tipping point. That melting will cause cata- strophic irreversible changes in the climate of earth. Triggers of Runaway Climate Change 1. Reduced CO, Absorption: First, we need to see the natural ability of the climate system. Oceans and ter- restrial ecosystems (say plants) work as the primary sinks for the absorption of CO,. That absorption capacity plays an important role in regulating global temperature. The absorption rate of primary sinks is 50% of total CO, emissions on earth. === Page 11 === people: Development and Environmen , Declining Absorption and Ocean Acidification: There is global warming due to increased GHGs. The temperature of vast seas is also increasing. they absorb more CO, and becoming acidic. This acidification by formation of carbonic acids is harmful to marine life (such as coral reefs) which actually function as lungs. As oceans warm, they expand. Add to this the melting of ice by glaciers and ice sheets. Sea level rise threat- ens coastal communities and ecosystems. _ Decreased Reflection of Sunlight: e The retreating snow and ice expose darker ground around polar areas and water surfaces. e These darker areas absorb more sunlight, leading to further warming. 4, Increased Natural Emissions of CO, and Methane: This are linked with fossil fuels etc. and melting of per- mafrost as discussed.

Summary:
Tipping point and runaway climate changes are interconnected, with tipping points representing a threshold beyond which uncontrollable climate changes occur, such as the melting of ice at the Arctic and Antarctic leading to irreversible climate impacts, triggered by factors like reduced CO2 absorption, ocean acidification, decreased sunlight reflection, and increased natural emissions of CO2 and methane.

These darker areas absorb more sunlight, leading to further warming. 4, Increased Natural Emissions of CO, and Methane: This are linked with fossil fuels etc. and melting of per- mafrost as discussed. Overall, sources such as soils, forests, peatlands, oceans, permafrost, and methane clathrates emit CO, and methane. The warmer tem- peratures can increase these natural emissions. india’s Vulnerabilities: As Per IPCC Reports e The IPCC is a UN-established scientific body. Its role is to assess climate change science and impacts. IPCC reports emphasize rising temperatures, extreme weather, sea-level rise, and ecological changes. The term ‘Code Red’ in AR6 (Sixth Assessment Report) highlights the critical stage of climate change. * Global CO, emissions must peak by 2020 and then decline rapidly to reach net zero around mid-century. ¢ To achieve this, global CO, emissions need to be reduced by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and by 85-90% by 2050. These reductions are necessary to limit global warm- ing to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. ° This signifies immediate action necessary. In context of India, the following findings are impor- ant in context of AR6: 1. CVI (Climate Vulnerability Index): This report for India builds upon the findings of AR6 to assess the vulnerability of different regions in India to climate change impacts. it provides a localized analysis of the risks and helps identify areas that require urgent adaptation measures. 2. IPCC on Poverty: This report uses information from AR6 to understand how climate change could affect poverty. It warns that climate-related problems might push many people into extreme poverty, harming their lives and incomes. IPCC on Financial Needs for Adaptation: This uses AR6 data to calculate the money needed for adap- tation in various. countries, including India. This yntrolla- ad, they ntarctic 3 to 2°C primary sorption g global sinks is information assists policymakers in determining the amount of resources necessary for successful adapta- tion strategies. 4.

Summary:
The IPCC reports emphasize the urgent need for global CO2 emissions to peak by 2020 and decline rapidly to reach net zero by mid-century in order to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, with immediate action necessary, and India's vulnerabilities to climate change impacts are highlighted in the context of the Climate Vulnerability Index, poverty, and financial needs for adaptation.

It emphasizes the impor- tance of substantial investments in clean energy and sustainable technologies as essential steps to combat climate change effectively. The Rio Summit, also known as the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from June 3 to 14, 1992. It was the first major international conference on sustainable development, and it brought together over 170 heads of state and government. The summit resulted in the adoption of three important documents: ¢ Rio Declaration on Environment and Development: This declaration contains 27 principles. that outline the rights and responsibilities of states in the pursuit of sustainable development. ° Main Principle: ‘The right to development is an inalienable human right.’ e Agenda 21: This contains over 2,000 recommen- dations for action by governments, businesses, and other stakeholders for sustainable development. ¢ The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD): This international treaty aims to conserve biodiver- sity; the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. This has been discussed in the coming paragraphs. UNFCCC Mission: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted during Rio Summit in 1992. UNFCCC came into force in © 1994. There are 197 nations who ratified the convention. The Mission of UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. In this Conference of the Parties (COP) was adopted as a regular arrangement that is the core decision making body.

Thus, UNFCCC created a legacy, specially in the form of COPs. REDD+ REDD+ emerged within the UNFCCC, evolving through international discussions and negotiations. It gained prominence in the mid-2000s; and was formally recog- nized as a climate change mechanism. It has been shaped and refined through global climate conferences and === Page 12 === involves multiple countries and organizations in its imple- mentation. More about COP: COP makes global climate policies. The member states come together to talk about, negoti- ate, and organize joint efforts to tackle climate change. Their main goals include cutting down emissions, adjust- ing to climate change effects, capacity building, funding and technical help to developing nations. COP is assisted by two subsidiary bodies which provide technical expertise and monitor implementation: 1. Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and 2. Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) Apart from these two, there are many adhoc working groups to assist. * COP decisions are usually made by consensus among all member countries, although voting is allowed if consensus cannot be reached. ° The parties outline their commitments to tackle climate change through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). A Quick idea About Major COPs Several major COPs under UNFCCC have been held to advance global environmental efforts. These include: 1. COP3 (Kyoto, 1997): The Kyoto Protocol was adopted, committing industrialized countries to limit and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accor- dance with agreed individual targets. It was the first agreement to set binding emission reduction targets for developed countries. COP11 (Montreal, 2005): The Montreal Action Plan was agreed upon, marking a significant step forward in the international climate change process, which included detailed rules for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. 3.

Summary:
The Conference of the Parties (COP) under the UNFCCC is a key decision-making body where member nations come together to discuss and negotiate global climate policies, including commitments to reduce emissions and address climate change effects.

ARBON IN TRADE ‘ne following discussion may help us.in the better under- tanding of Kyoto Plan. arbon Space: This concept refers to the idea of setting dimit on the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions jlowable to prevent excessive global temperature rise. or example, if a limit of 1000 billion tons of CO2 is set o be not exceeded by 2100, it aims to keep the Earth’s emperature from increasing more than 2 degrees Celsius bove pre-industrial levels. We can keep our targets and ake better mitigation plans. arbon Trading arbon trading is a market-based system where compa- ies buy and. sell emission allowances. Each allowance ermits a certain amount of carbon dioxide to be emitted. ‘a company emits less CO, than its allowance, it can sell he surplus to others. This system incentivizes companies ¢ reduce emissions, as they can profit from selling excess llowances. Carbon trading is relevant for encouraging nvironmentally friendly practices and meeting global mission reduction goals. There are two choices available under carbon trading: ations (or institutions) which are not in a position to cut own their pollution or burning more carbon can buy car- on credits. _ They buy these credits from countries that are doing better at reducing pollution, like India or China. Thus, it makes sense for us to cut down pollution or make invest- ment in climate friendly projects. Capturing CO, before it gets to the atmosphere.

Thus, Kyoto Protocol was a significant step in interna- tional climate policy that introduced binding targets for developed nations to mitigate climate change. However, it could not be effective due to lack of participation of some major emitters and the complex nature of international emissions trading. === Page 14 === The Pari significant international commitment aimed at combat- ing climate change. It was adopted in 2015 with the fol- lowing frameworks and objectives: 1. Frameworks: * Technology Framework: Encourages develop- ment and transfer of climate-friendly technologies. ° Capacity-Building Framework: Aims to build capabilities, particularly in developing countries, to meet climate challenges. * Transparency Framework: Ensures clear report- ing and tracking of countries’ climate actions and support. 2. Financial Commitments: Developed countries are required to mobilize at least $100 billion annually by Figure 9.20 Targets for Paris Agreement 8.

Summary:
The Kyoto Protocol introduced binding emission reduction targets for developed nations, while the Paris Agreement aims to combat climate change through frameworks for technology transfer, capacity-building, and financial commitments from developed countries.

The protocol also establishes a framework for prior informed consent (PIC) and mutually agreed terms (MAT), which are two important safeguards for the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities. The Nagoya Protocol has a number of provisions to ensure compliance. Aichi Biodiversity Targets Task Force (ABTTF): This coordinates international efforts to implement the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, involving various agencies and organizations like Zero Extinction, Birdlife, CITES, FAO, GEF, IUCN, UNEP, and others. They are the set of 20 global targets for biodiversity conserva- tion which were adopted by CBD in 2010. For example, at least 17% of terrestrial and inland water areas, and 10% of coastal and marine areas. Also By 2020, to improve at least 15% of degraded ecosystems. Kunmine-Montreat GLoBaL BioDivERSITY Framework (GBF) This set of commitments is made by countries at the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in December 2022 to address the biodiversity crisis. The key drivers of the nature crisis: 1. Changes in land and sea use: The GBF calls for a reduc- tion in the conversion of natural habitats to agriculture and other human uses. It also calls for the restoration of degraded habitats. Agriculture alone is a threat to 85 per cent of the 28,000 species at risk of extinction. Remember Target: Protecting 30% of the planet’s land and 30% of its marine areas by 2030. 2. Climate change: Global warming threatens as many as one in six species at the global level. The GBF recog- nizes that climate change is a major threat to biodiver- sity. It calls for action to reduce greenhouse gas emis- sions and to help ecosystems adapt to climate change. 3. Pollution: The GBF calls for a reduction in the use of pesticides and other pollutants that harm biodiver- sity. The use of pesticides is the ‘MAIN cause’ of plant and insect decline. There is need for development of cleaner technologies.

Summary:
The Nagoya Protocol aims to ensure fair compensation for countries providing genetic resources and traditional knowledge, while the Aichi Biodiversity Targets Task Force and Kunmine-Montreat Global Biodiversity Framework work towards conservation goals and addressing key drivers of the nature crisis such as changes in land and sea use, climate change, and pollution.
