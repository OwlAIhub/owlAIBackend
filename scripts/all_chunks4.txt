THe Neep ror Vatue Epucation The need for imparting value education arises from sey. eral contemporary issues and societal changes. Here are the main issues: 1. Tradition versus Modernity: We need to strike a bal. ance between traditional values and modernization. Value education helps young learners appreciate posj- tive aspects of tradition, such as tolerance, harmony, and collectivism, while also embracing beneficia] aspects of modernization. Globalization: With societies becoming increasingly multicultural, individuals must learn to navigate a complex and diverse global environment. Value edu- cation can help in understanding and respecting dif- ferent cultures. Diversity: Balancing universality and diversity, is a challenge in a democratic and diverse society. Value education promotes respect and understanding of various cultural, social, and religious backgrounds. Inclusivity: A healthy society is inclusive, making all members feel valued and involved. Value education fosters a sense of belonging and acceptance among individuals. Environmental Concerns: Issues like global warm-. ing, pollution, deforestation, and soil erosion high- light the need for environmental consciousness. Value education emphasizes the ethical responsibility towards sustainable environmental practices. Explosion of Science and Technology: The ethical use of science and technology is critical. Value educa- tion addresses the moral and ethical responsibilities associated with the application of scientific and tech- nological advancements. Impact of Mass and Social Media: The pervasive - influence of media in daily life often transmits values and attitudes contrary to those upheld by families, schools, and society. Value education helps individu- als critically evaluate media content and its impact on values and behaviour. Key DEVELOPMENTS IN VALUE EDUCATION 1. National Commission of Secondary Education (1952-53): Emphasized character building as the primary goal of education. University Education Commission (1962):.

ORGANIZATIONAL StTrucTURE OF Universimes in INDIA 1. Historical Roots: India has strong roots of education. Ancient Indian education was influenced by Vedanta, Buddhism, and Jainism. This era led to India being known as Jagat Guru’. The government aims to retain elements of this ancient system in modern education. 2. British Influence: The current university system has its origins in British colonial rule. ° Early Institutions: There is a big list of establish- ments such as Calcutta Madrasa (1781), Asiatic Society of Bengal (1784), Banaras Sanskrit === Page 6 === 10.42 College (1791) among others which were founded during this period. ° British Parliament’s Role: The Charter Act of 1813 declared Indian education a duty of the state. e Macaulay’s Minute of 1835: This gave priority to British-style education in India. ° Establishment of Universities: In 1857, universi-. ties in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras were estab- lished, modeled on the University of London. The University of Allahabad, established in 1887, was more graduate-focused. ¢ Cultural Colonization: The British used the uni- versity system as a tool for cultural influence.

Since May the programme ‘Sights of Shanxi’ has been airing live every Friday on a channel in the north- ern province of that time. In the show, local cities bid to play host to a tourism development conference. The contestants have to tell four judges why there city is such a great place, in front of a studio audi- ence of 100 people and a panel of experts. The judges grill the contestants who advance or fall according to votes cast by the audience in the studio, the judges, and internet users.

Title: Local Officials Compete on Reality TV Show

of a studio audi- ence of 100 people and a panel of experts. The judges grill the contestants who advance or fall according to votes cast by the audience in the studio, the judges, and internet users. What makes this special is that for the first time local bigwigs are not just speaking in public, which is rare enough, but competing against one another and being judged by ordinary folk, which is unheard of, One tourism official from Shanxi told a newspa- per that ‘in the past all we had to do was hand ina report, but because it is on TV, the process now had to be taken more seriously.’ Top officials have to be involved. Of the eleven con- testants, three are municipal communist party bosses, five are city mayors, and three are vice mayors. For most of them, it has been their first experience to live cameras. They have taken to it like natural. The mayor of Yangquan city learnt a bit of English to spice up his bid. ‘Seeing is believing’, he said. ‘The open and inclusive Yangquan people welcome you to come.’ The party chief of Yucheng suffered a slipped disc, but soldiered on, rehearsing her speech flat on her back. The Deputy Mayor of Linfen handed out virtual reality glasses to the judges as part of his pitch and it worked, he won his round. Viewers love seeing judges take officials to task, ‘you would do better to tell us just one or two things instead of so many that we forget them’ said one judge. ‘What did you mean by your slogan?’ asked another. ‘TT did not get it.’ So far 8.3 million people have voted online. The government itself is partly responsible for the show’s success and has good reason to be encouraging the people. Shanxi’s economy has been struggling; tourism is its favoured way of diversifying away from its traditional coal mining business. In other words, appealing to an audience actually helps its broader aims. Perhaps, the idea will catch on and 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. some reality hosts will, one day, make the great leg into nationwide politics, perhaps even running for Presidency. According to the passage which of the following state. ments is/are false? (a) The party chief of Yucheng participated in one of the shows with a slipped disc.

Summary:
Local government officials in Shanxi are participating in a reality TV show where they are judged by a studio audience and panel of experts, with the goal of promoting tourism and diversifying the economy, and the statement that the party chief of Yucheng participated in the show with a slipped disc is false.

s, samples should be representative of population. (c): Cybernetics is closely related to the concept of utomatic control and also with physiology, particu- larly the physiology of the nervous system. A ‘control- ler’ might be the human brain, which receives signals from a ‘monitor’ (the eyes) regarding the distance between a reaching hand and an object to be picked up. The information sent by the monitor to the con- troller is called feedback, and on the basis of this feed- back the controller might issue instructions to bring the observed behaviour (the reaching of the hand) closer to the desired behaviour (the picking up of the object). It is used in computer sciences and other areas as well. (c): 139-4=135 135-7 (=4+4+ 3) = 128 128-12 (=7 + 5) = 116 116-19 (=12 +7) = 97 97 —- 28 (=19+9) = 69 Assume that desired ratio is 2x, 3x, and 7x.

(b): We need to take help of ‘Square of opposition’. As per definition in question statement, we need to look at ‘contrary statements’, which should be univer- sal positive (A) and universal negative (E). Thus, (b) is the right answer. (b): Required Ratio = (83 + 108 + 74 + 88 + 98)/(98 +112 + 101+ 133 + 142) = 451/586 = 1/1.3 = 10/13 (d): Average amount of interest paid by the company during the given period = & [(23.4 + 32.5 + 41.6 + 36.4 + 49.4)/5] lakhs. = € (183.3/5) lakhs = % 36.66 lakhs. (c): Required percentage = [(288 + 98 + 3.00 + 23.4 + 83)/(420 + 142 + 3.96 + 49.4 + 98)] x 100 per cent = (495.4/713.36 xX 100) per cent ~ 69.45 per cent (c): Required percentage = [(3.00 + 2.52 + 3.84 + 3.68 + 3.96)/(288 + 342 +324 + 336 + 420)] x 100 per cent.

The invention of the airplane was no exception. Although many people who heard about the first powered flight on December 17, 1903, were excited and impressed, others reacted with peals of laughter. The idea of flying an aircraft was repulsive to some people. Such people called Wilbur and Orville Wright, ‘the inventors of the first flying machine’, impulsive fools. Negative reactions, however, did not stop the Wrights. Impelled by their desire to succeed, they continued their experiments in aviation. Orville and Wilbur Wright always had a compel- ling interest in aeronautics and mechanics. As young === Page 4 === boys, they earned money by making and selling kites and mechanical toys. Later, they designed a newspa- _ per-folding machine, built a printing press, and oper- ated a bicycle repair shop. In 1896, when they read about the death of Otto Lilienthal, the brothers’ inter- est in flight grew into a compulsion. Lilienthal, a pioneer in hang-gliding, had con- trolled his gliders by shifting his body in the desired direction. This idea was repellent to the Wright broth- ers, however, they searched for more efficient meth- ods to control the balance of airborne vehicles. In 1900 and 1901, the Wrights tested numerous glid- ers and developed control techniques. The brothers’ inability to obtain enough lift power for the gliders almost led them to abandon their efforts. _ After further study, the Wright brothers con- cluded that the published tables of air pressure on curved surfaces must be wrong. They set up a wind © tunnel and began a series of experiments with model wings. Because of their efforts, the old tables were repealed in time and replaced by the first reliable fig- ures for air pressure on curved surfaces.

Summary:
The passage discusses the initial ridicule faced by the Wright brothers for their invention of the airplane, their perseverance in the face of negative reactions, and their innovative approach to solving technical challenges in aviation.

Because of their efforts, the old tables were repealed in time and replaced by the first reliable fig- ures for air pressure on curved surfaces. This work, in turn, made it possible for the brothers to design a machine that would fly. In 1903, the Wrights built their first airplane, which cost less than $1,000. They even designed and built their own source of propul- sion — a lightweight gasoline engine. When they started the engine on December 17, the airplane pul- sated wildly before taking off. The plane managed to stay aloft for 12 seconds, however, and it flew 120 feet. By 1905, the Wrights had perfected the first air- plane that could turn, circle, and remain airborne for ANSWER KEYS 1.

392-140 = 252 364 /(1+1) = 182 182 document business, specifically by Frank and Lillian Gilbreth. They are used in any field such as-education, business, manufacturing, engineering, architecture, etc. Few examples have been shown below - (d): Integral Education-The concept of Integral Education was given by Sri Aurobindo that is based on the belief that the education of a human being should begin at birth and continue throughout his life. The main objective of any kind of education is to ensure the realization of the inner potential of the learner. Thus, this concept is quite dynamic and flex- ible, it takes into account the whole personality of the learner, through the concept of dealing with the ‘whole child’. This takes into account the individual curiosity, passion and compassion, and this applies to all situations in a beautiful manner. There are integral schools at many places in India as enunci- ated by Sri Aurobindo and his spiritual companion Mirra Alfassa ~ known as mother. Focus on spiritual aspects of Indian philosophy- This is associated with Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan’s metaphysics that is based on Sankara’s Advaita (non- dual) Vedanta tradition (sampradaya). He was asso- ciated with Prasthanatraya (main primary texts of Vedanta), Upanishads, Brahma Sutra, and the Bhaga- vad Gita. He was greatly influenced by the writings and work of Swami Vivekananda. Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan was actively involved in the works of UNESCO. He was known for being a bridge between eastern and western philosophies to === Page 6 === promote world unity and universal fellowship. To Dr Radhakrishnan — ‘The idea of God is an interpreta- tion of experience’. Learning to take place in nature and from nature- Sri Rabindranath Tagore believed in complete free- dom of every kind for the students in terms of his intellectual level, decision making, feelings, knowl- edge, etc. The independence means normalcy or the fact of being natural. There should be harmony between man, God and nature. There is need to prac- tice equanimity, harmony and balance. Experiential Learning-In John Dewey’s experien- tial learning theory, everything occurs within a social environment.

Summary:
The document discusses various educational philosophies and approaches, including Integral Education, focus on spiritual aspects of Indian philosophy, learning from nature, and experiential learning theory by John Dewey.

n man, God and nature. There is need to prac- tice equanimity, harmony and balance. Experiential Learning-In John Dewey’s experien- tial learning theory, everything occurs within a social environment. Knowledge is socially constructed and based on experiences. This knowledge should be organized in real-life experiences that provide a con- text for the information. The names of other great per- sonalities such as David Kolb, Kurt Lewin, and Jean Piaget can be associated with experiential learning. (b): Every learner (in fact, an individual) is unique. This also gives rise to the concept of ‘individual differences’. Every learner has her/his own characteristics. For a teacher, the individual differences in the form of vari- ables such as physical characteristics, intelligence, per- ception, gender, ability, learning styles are important. A more effective and productive learning-teaching process can be planned by a teacher with this kind of knowledge. Assessments are a useful way of maintaining qual- ity. Assessments assess students’ understanding, knowledge, and takeaways from the educational experience. Assessments make learning process more effective and enhance student development. Usually, the assessments make use of empirical data. Summative Assessment-This evaluates the overall learning of the students at the end of a unit or course. This assessment compares against some standardized criteria or benchmark. These are basically formal in nature which help in awarding a certificate also. This assessment can be written assessment (writing an orig- inal piece, such as a narrative or analytical essay), per- formance assessment (to do an activity or task that will showcase the abilities of the learners), standardized assessment (an exam created for a given curriculum) or oral assessment (such as a speech or presentation). Formative Assessment-This assessment measures how a student is learning during a course of study. The goal is to monitor student learning to provide ongoing feedback that can be used by instructors to improve their teaching and by students to improve their learning. This word can be linked with actual formation of career of a student in the class.

Summary:
Experiential learning theory emphasizes the importance of social interactions and real-life experiences in constructing knowledge, while individual differences and assessments play a crucial role in enhancing the learning-teaching process and student development.

Title: Enhancing Teaching and Learning through Feedback and Assessment

Text:
ongoing feedback that can be used by instructors to improve their teaching and by students to improve their learning. This word can be linked with actual formation of career of a student in the class. ‘Diagnostic Assessment-A diagnostic assessment is an evaluation of a child’s knowledge and skill level 10. of a certain topic. These assessments are done at the start of the topic to understand how much students already know about the subject. Peer Assessment: This assessment provides a struc- ‘tured learning process for students to critique and provide feedback to each other on their work. Thus, students develop lifelong skills. It equips them with skills to self-assess and improve their own work. (b): e-PG Pathshala-The UGC has launched an e-PG Pathshala Project for standardizing the textbook mate- rials for MA, MSc and MCom courses in different uni- versities of India. In India, e-PG Pathshala is such an innovation maintained by UGC-INFLIBNET and funded by Ministry of Education. As part of its National Educa- tion Mission through ICT (NME-ICT), itis a wide e-learn- ing platform in terms of its subject material and breadth of use as well. On the other hand, Ministry of Education (earlier MHRD) launched ‘e-pathshala’ web portal to host educational resources for students, teachers, par- ents, researchers and educators. This is a single point repository of e- resources containing NCERT text- books and various other learning resources. The affective domain is one of the three domains in Bloom’s Taxonomy. The affective domain as described by Krathwohl, Bloom, Masia in the year 1973, includes the manner in which we deal with things emotionally, such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms, motiva- tions, and attitudes. As per question, they have been put in the following five categories (for future questions): 1. Receiving (a) awareness of the action (b) desire to achieve action (c) controlled attention to action 2. Response (responding) (a) In response to an agreement (b) Desire to respond (c) Response Contentment 3. Evaluation (valuing) (a) Acceptance of value (valuing) (b) Priority of value (c) Commitment 4.

Summary:
Ongoing feedback from diagnostic and peer assessments, as well as the use of e-learning platforms like e-PG Pathshala and e-pathshala, can help instructors improve their teaching and students improve their learning, while also developing lifelong skills in self-assessment and improvement in the affective domain.

This could be temperature, height, age, etc. Basically, a variable is anything that contributes to the outcome or result of your experi- ment in any way. , Control Variable-A control variable is anything that is held constant or limited in a research study. It’s a variable that is not of interest to the study’s aims, but is controlled because it could influence the outcomes. For example, one control variable in the plant growth experiment could be temperature. Assume that this should be kept uniform at 25° C, so it is the duty of researcher to keep it at this uniform level. External variable~These variables are factors that are not manipulated as part of an experiment, but they may exert some influence on the dependent vari- able under study. Confounding Variable—This is an unmeasured third variable that ‘confounds’ (or influences) the relation- ship between an independent and a dependent vari- able. It actually suggests the presence of a spurious correlation. Confounding is a causal concept, and as such, cannot be described in terms of correlations or associations.

Title: Advantages and Disadvantages of Qualitative Research

Text:
e sur- vey research that offers individual concepts to sur- vey respondents in isolation-one at a time. The independent findings are required for each stimu- lus. They provide clear detailed feedback. This is available with every automated tool. This can be compared with polyadic variables. In comparison testing several stimuli are tested simultaneously. (c): There are two kinds of variables-Qualitative and Quantitative Qualitative Variables—This is also called as a categor- ical variable. As the name indicates, it is not numeri- cal. This describes data that fits into categories. These are all qualitative variables as they have no natural order. The examples are Skin colours—White, Yellow, Brown, Black States—-Haryana, Punjab, Manipur, Kerala Quantitative variables~They have a value and they can be added, subtracted, divided or multiplied. Now look at the detailed discussion in context of its disadvantages. A. Too sensitive to context-The main objective of qualitative or any kind of research is to connect with the theme or basic idea. It is basically behav- ioural in nature. B. Open To Debate-tt is also positive reflection as it is linked with the transparency. C. Too subjective-Qualitative can always be some- what subjective but being too much subjective is its negative characteristic as the personal view- point becomes very important. === Page 8 === D. Difficult to generalise-Though generalisation is the main objective of any kind of research but qualitative lacks in that. E. Issue of replication—There are always less and less chances of replication so that the generalisation also becomes difficult. Thus, this can be taken as the dis- advantage of qualitative research. 14. (a): The word ‘sample’ mostly applies in the case of research. Thus, the word project can be taken as research project. Sample helps us in finding the truth or getting us very close to the truth. Sample size calculation and determination are imperative to the researcher to deter- mine the right number of respondents, keeping in mind the research study’s quality. The sample is the miniature version of the population that reflects the desired features.

Summary:
Survey research can offer individual concepts to respondents one at a time, with independent findings required for each stimulus, providing clear feedback, and can be compared with polyadic variables, with qualitative variables describing data in categories and quantitative variables having numerical value and being subject to disadvantages such as sensitivity to context, openness to debate, subjectivity, difficulty in generalization, and issues of replication, while sample size calculation is important in research to reflect the desired features of the population.

Title: Determining Sample Size and Research Techniques

Text:
o the researcher to deter- mine the right number of respondents, keeping in mind the research study’s quality. The sample is the miniature version of the population that reflects the desired features. That helps us in sav- ing time and associated costs. In qualitative studies, the study is mostly subjective, and the sample size may have to be kept small as we want to do their detailed analysis. Thus, the population size matters, so is the confidence level (90%, 95% or 99% to reflect upon the accuracy and confidence of results), the margin of error (confi- dence interval), standard deviation from mean (also called as sigma that reflects upon the variability of a distribution of population) — all these things matter to a researcher. Necessary Sample Size = (Z-score)2 * StdDev*(1- StdDev) / (margin of error)? The precision of obtaining the results from popula- tion may ask for changing the sample size. Thus, the population variability is important. If the popula- tion is homogeneous, a researcher can manage with smaller sample and vice versa. We have to determine if the increased accuracy is more important than the cost. There can be probability (random and objective) or non-probability (non random and more subjective) sampling techniques. The choices D and E are not or least important for a researcher as research should always be objective. (b): Meta-analysis intends to take a quick review of multiple research studies on basically the same or closely related problem or issue. combines the results of multiple scientific studies. It is basically a quanti- tative, formal, epidemiological study design that is based on randomized, controlled trials. Content Analysis—this is basically used in qualitative studies where the answers may be subjective which are based on the personal opinion. The language used by the respondents in the qualitative research (such as 16. 18. case studies) may be different and a researcher neeq to find the basic idea or description. This is called con. tent analysis. Semantic Differential-A semantic differential can be used for the structuring of attitudes, most likely in qualitative studies.

Summary:
Determining the right number of respondents for a research study is crucial for its quality, with factors such as population size, confidence level, margin of error, and standard deviation all playing a role in determining the necessary sample size, while also considering the importance of accuracy versus cost, and the use of probability or non-probability sampling techniques.

Title: Content Analysis, Semantic Differential, and Social Network Analysis in Communication

Text:
o find the basic idea or description. This is called con. tent analysis. Semantic Differential-A semantic differential can be used for the structuring of attitudes, most likely in qualitative studies. This survey or questionnaire rating scale asks people to rate a product, event, or any ‘entity’ within the frames of a multi-point rating option. These survey answering options are gram- matically on opposite adjectives at each end. As they are opposite to each other on the two ends of a con- tinuum, this may be called as bipolar adjective. Social Network Analysis—The dyad definition is the close relationship of two people over a long period with many interactions in different settings. The most basic requirement for dyad sociology is that there are two members of the group. The dyadic communica- tion definition pertains to how the two group mem- bers interact with each other. German sociologist Georg Simmel studied how group dynamics changed based on the size of the group. (a): The word effective in communication means that a message has been sent and received properly with an understanding. That understanding is reflected by ‘feedback’. In a classroom, an effective listener is completely focused and thus tries to resist any kind of distraction (or noise) that exists in the environment. Message filtering in communication may actually be perceived as a communication, as some fact is kept hidden, distorted or manipulated with an objective to manage receiver’s reaction. For example, a manager tries to hide the poor sales figures of his division so that the receiver (boss) does not get angry. (a): This question is about face to face communica- tion but different levels have been given by different authors. In two way communication, the sender of message gets the feedback from the receiver, that ful- fils the basic objective of communication. The main objective of communication is understanding the message in the intended form. Our answer is Level 1 as the communication is two way and Face to Face between two persons. There can be higher channels as per the channels involved. The verbal,.

Summary:
Content analysis is used to analyze the basic idea or description of a product or event, while a semantic differential survey asks people to rate entities using opposite adjectives, and social network analysis focuses on the close relationships and interactions between two group members in communication.

The verbal,. physical, auditory, emotional and energetic are also described as the five levels of communication. (b): Time Sense-This is linked with temporal aspect linked with culture. Western cultures, even South East Asia tend to measure their time by the clock, keeping in view that each activity should have a precise begin- ning and end that may be termed as linear timing. To them, the word ‘deadline’ is very important. Western- === Page 9 === ers also see that time has a limited supply, so they structure that accordingly. In India, there is a concept of rebirth (punrjanam), we assume that if something could not be completed in this birth, will be completed in next birth. India has the concepts of satya yug, dwapar yug, treta yug and kaliyug, according to different time spans and culture makes a shift accordingly. In most parts of India, Paki- stan, Bangladesh. etc. a culture is event or personality- related. The culture also travels if we look at history. Some practices which were part of Greece travelled to India and vice versa. Thus, the institutions such as marraige become institutional. Level of Gratitude-This is an integral part of cul- ture According to Robert Emmons as he expressed in his book Thanks, ‘Gratitude is literally one of the few things that can measurably change people’s lives’. Gratitude can improve our health and rela- tionships—making it one of the most well-studied and effective ways to increase our well-being in life. This level of gratitude varies according to our culture such as India, China, Russia, Japan, Ger- many, etc. There can be high context, low context, temporal context, emotive context, directive, phatic contexts of different cultures which have been men- tioned in Pearson Unit 3. They found some similarities across cultures, as well as some differences—an initial glimpse at how our early steps toward gratefulness might be shaped by larger societal forces.

Summary:
Communication can be categorized into different levels, such as face to face interaction, with cultural aspects like time sense and gratitude playing a significant role in shaping communication patterns across different societies.

They found some similarities across cultures, as well as some differences—an initial glimpse at how our early steps toward gratefulness might be shaped by larger societal forces. There can be Verbal or oral grat- itude, concrete gratitude (offering toffee, chocolate, etc) and connective gratitude (offer of friendship or help, etc). (c): Statement 1~Small group communication refers to interactions among three or more people who are connected through a common purpose, mutual influ- ence, and a shared identity which indicate the rela- tionship needs. The upper number of a small group is taken between 15 to 20. Statement 2-A person who is well informed about the group’s task and/or highly motivated as a group member may emerge as a leader and set into motion internal decision-making processes, such as recruit- ing new members or assigning group roles, that affect the structure of a group. Different members will also gravitate toward different roles within the group and will advocate for certain procedures and courses of action over others. External factors such as group size, task, and resources also affect group structure. (d): The options seem to be very close ones so that we need to get some idea about all of them. ‘A. Creation of passive longing for media prod- ucts—It has the word ‘passive’, otherwise we see the media and audience and products for audi- ence as dynamic and active. B. Omnivorous devouring of media content -— Here, omnivorous means to consume all kinds of food and devouring means consuming them. Omnivorous devouring means that all types of media content is being taken in, but media has to show the contents to the audience or public also, so that it is appreciated (or depreciated). C. Compensation through identification—-Here, identification means connectivity with the audi- ence or public so that some kind of rewards (through advertisements) can be generated. That is basically being done by YouTube, Face- book, Instagram, etc. They develop loyalty and CRM (Customer Relationship Management). D.

Summary:
Small group communication involves interactions among three or more people with a common purpose and shared identity, with leadership emerging from those who are well-informed and motivated, while external factors such as group size and resources also play a role in shaping group structure.

some kind of rewards (through advertisements) can be generated. That is basically being done by YouTube, Face- book, Instagram, etc. They develop loyalty and CRM (Customer Relationship Management). D. Vicarious Wish Fulfilment—Vicarious méans a feeling developed or experienced by watching or reading about somebody else doing something, rather than by doing it yourself. An example of vicarious is when a mother who always wanted to be a dancer continually pushes her children to do ballet. Freud’s most well-known theory, wish fulfilment, is the idea that when wishes can’t or won’t be fulfilled in our waking lives, they are carried out in dreams. Even anxious or punishing dreams have their roots in wish fulfilment. Freud’s dream theory is rooted in the idea that we all need a way to express or vicariously fulfil all of our wishes and desires. Now, we see that people are led by their dreams and fantasies. The social media generates the need for product which were not felt by public till they see them on social media. Sources of suggestion for appropriate roles—this point is vey important. Even the children of today want to empathize the roles of adult members. This role per- ception means that they are becoming more assertive and challenging. They have almost complete access to media that enables them to challenge the roles being played by elders.

(d): Statement I-‘Some S is P’ belongs to ‘I-category’ AND ‘Some S is not P’ belongs to ‘O-category’. That has been explained in the explanation given under question 26. By looking at first diagram in question 26, we can say that I and O are sub-contrary to each other, they are not contrary to each other. So, Statement I is a false statement. Statement II-Again, ‘Some S is/are not P’ is a ‘O-cat- egory’ statement and ‘All S is P’ is a ‘A-category’ statement. As given in square of opposition diagram, both O and A are contradictory to each other. Thus, Statement II is a true statement. Thus, (d) is the correct answer. (a): Statement I-The anumana is basically about attaining inferential knowledge. That is further linked with invariable concomitance or vyapti. Thus, the anu- mana is based on syllogistic inference that is basically invariable concomitance (vyapti) between middle term and major term. Concomitance means the fact of existing or occurring together with something else. Thus, we are basically concerned with the definition of Vyapti that is the non-presence of middle term (hetu) in the locus of the non-existence of the major term (sadhya). Vyapti is an invariable and uncon- ditional relation between the middle term and the major term. For example, the hill is full of fire because it is full of smoke. Here, smoke which is the middle term is absent from all regions outside the region of fire (the major term). Statement II-Vyapti may also be defined as the co- presence of the middle term with the major term when there is no condition attached to the middle term.

Summary:
Ad Populum, also known as 'Appeal to Popularity', is an argument that supports a position by appealing to the shared opinion of a large group of people, such as the majority, and is exemplified by a statement from XYZ Home Finance appealing to be like a family member in order to encourage the purchase of a home through their financing options.

Vyapti is the possession of that nature which establishes the connection of the middle term with the major term. We can show the relation between minor term (paksh), middle term (hetu) and major term (sad- hya) with the help of following diagram. Major Term Minor Term Middle Term (Mountain) (Reason) vyapya (Fire) vyapaka Characteristic: (smoke) Factum factum linga probans probandum (c): Anumana is knowledge that is obtained after a proof. Anumana is not a direct knowledge but it tr i nc is obtained after some perception, testimony, etc. According to question, we can discuss the following three aspects. 1. Purvavat-This is basically cause to. effect rela- tionship. This can also be termed as unperceived effect from a perceived cause, thus the perceived cause comes first and thereafter, the unperceived effect (anuman). For example, we can infer the future rain from a present dark clouds. 2. Sesavat—An inference in which the unperceived cause is known from a perceived effect. For example, we come to know about the rain from a muddy flow of water in the river. 3. Samanyatodrasta Anumana-There are many universal positions in this world such as different positions of moon around the earth. From these, we can draw inferences. 31. (a): MODEM functions as both - input and output device. MODEM isacontraction oftwowords-MOdulator / DEModulator which functions simultaneously. 1. When sending communications out of the net- work, the modem converts (modulates) a digital signal into an analog signal for transmission over analog media such as cable or telephone line. 2. When signals are coming into the modem from the internet, it converts (demodulates) the analog signal back to a digital signal for transmission. on the local network. 32. (a): A. Trojan Horse-This is a type of malware that dis- guises itself as legitimate code or software.

Summary:
Vyapti is the connection between the middle term and major term in logic, and Anumana is knowledge obtained through inference based on perceived causes and effects.

Title: Impact of Asbestos and Cyclones in India

Text:
attack jg meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users, 36. (b): Asbestos was nicknamed “the magic minera]” as it has unique chemical and physical properties. The asbestos is used in thousands of products and industries such as roofing, thermal and electrica] insulation, cement pipe and sheets, flooring, plas- tics, textiles, paper, etc. Tiny asbestos fibres collect in the lungs. Asbestos causes mesothelioma, that is a relatively rare cancer of the thin membranes that line the chest and abdomen. It causes cancers of the lung, larynx and ovary. Mesothelioma treatments include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Asbestosis causes permanent lung damage. In Pleu- ral effusions, fluid collects around the lungs. Asbestos deposits are found in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Manipur. 37. (a): The occurrence of cyclones is a sea linked phe- nomena so there are no chances of its origin from Northern and Central India. It originates in the seas due to low air pressure conditions. The East coast receives cyclones not only from those that originated in Andaman Sea but also from the Pacific Ocean (typhoons). For transfer of typhoons, there is no big land mass to stop this. The Bay of Bengal receives - more rainfall in comparison to west coast. The winds are slower and weaker over the ocean. This part is also fed by rivers Ganga and Brahmaputra. The surface sea temperature and humidity also play an important part. The average temperature is around 28°C that is intensified by warm air currents. Odisha state suffers the most from cyclones. The ratio between cyclones from east coasts and west coasts is 4:1. The tropical cyclones are less in west coast due to dry air intrusion as dry winds flow from west to east. The Arabian Peninsula is already dry. There is a strong wind shear which hampers cyclone development. | The naming of cyclones is done in a schematic manner by World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) that was set up in the year 1950, the roots of which were planted at the 1873 Vienna International Meteorolog- ical Congress.

Summary:
Asbestos, known as "the magic mineral," is used in various industries and products but can cause serious health issues such as mesothelioma and asbestosis, while cyclones primarily originate in the seas and impact regions like Odisha in India.

s is done in a schematic manner by World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) that was set up in the year 1950, the roots of which were planted at the 1873 Vienna International Meteorolog- ical Congress. WMO maintains rotating lists of names which are appropriate for each Tropical Cyclone basin. If a cyclone is particularly deadly or costly, then its name is retired and replaced by another one. === Page 13 === Flowering Plants 268, 000 species , 38. (b): A. Greater biodiversity in ecosystems, species, and individuals leads to greater stability. For exam- ple, species with high genetic diversity and many populations that are adapted to a wide variety of conditions are more likely to be able to with- ‘ stand weather disturbances, disease, and climate change. In other words, the two key compo- nents of ecosystem stability are resilience and resistance. Resistance is an ecosystem’s ability to remain stable when confronted with a distur- bance. Resilience is the speed at which an ecosys- tem recovers from a disturbance. B. Extinction is the death of all members of a species of plants, animals, or other organisms. The three types of extinction are mass extinction, back- ground extinction, and human led extinction. Earth could lose 16% of its species if the average global temperature rise exceeds 4.3 °C. Human activities in the form of anthropogenic activities are basically human interference. The main modern causes of extinction are the urban- isation, industrialisation, loss and degradation of habitat (mainly deforestation), over exploita- tion (hunting, overfishing), invasive species, cli- mate change, and nitrogen pollution. Our global food system is the primary driver of biodiversity loss, with agriculture alone being the identified threat to 24,000 of the 28,000 (86%) species at risk of extinction. C. Habitat fragmentation actually leads to with- drawal of support systems to many other species which put their survival at stake. D.

Summary:
The World Meteorological Organisation maintains rotating lists of names for tropical cyclones, retiring names of particularly deadly or costly storms, while biodiversity and ecosystem stability are threatened by extinction caused by human activities such as urbanization, industrialization, and agriculture.

D. Vertebrates Invertebrates 69, 276 species 1,305,250 species Fungi & Protists 52, 280 species Invertebrates are central to the functioning of ecosys- tems, and are important part of biodiversity, yet they are underappreciated and understudied. The Red List 39. of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an important ref- erence for the threat of species, but it is still heavily biased towards vertebrates, with invertebrates being particularly underrepresented. (d): Landfills—Landfill gases produced during bio- logical degradation of buried organic wastes include methane, which when released to the atmosphere, can contribute to global climate change. This can be taken as a part of manure management. Methane is the second-most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, after carbon dioxide. According to the IPCC, more than 40 per cent of meth- ane emissions come from farms or are an outcome of peatland destruction. A quarter of the global emissions are products of agriculture and land-use changes. The pledge by more than 80 nations, helped by the US and EU, to cut emissions of this GHG (greenhouse gas) by 30 per cent is, therefore, an important step in global warming mitigation efforts. Methane is 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. While much of the conten- tious aspects of curbing emissions of this GHG pertain to agriculture, the oil and gas industry — especially natural gas, whose popularity as a relatively cleaner fossil fuel has led to a 50 per cent increase in its use in the past 10 years — is the second-highest emitter of this gas.

Summary:
Invertebrates are crucial to ecosystems and biodiversity, yet they are underrepresented in the Red List of Threatened Species, and methane emissions from agriculture and landfills contribute significantly to global climate change.

Participants joining the Pledge agree to take voluntary actions to contribute to a col- lective effort to reduce global methane emissions at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, which could eliminate over 0.2°C warming by 2050. This is a global pledge, and not a national reduction target. Russia, India and China have not signed the Global Methane Pledge. === Page 14 === 40. A. Emission Trading — Kyoto Protocol— This proto- col was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005. The main objective of Kyoto Protocol was to reduce the emission of gases. This was put into practice by committing industrialized countries and economies in transition to limit and reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The follow- ing were the key objectives of Kyoto Protocol. 1. International Emissions Trading ; 2. Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) 3. Joint implementation (JD There were annexed nations for the purpose of reduction of gases. The key concept was ‘com- mon but differentiated responsibilities’ (CBDR). The main GHGs were Carbon dioxide (CO,), Methane (CH,), Nitrous oxide (N,0), Hydro- fluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbons (PFCs); and Sulphur hexafluoride (SF,). B.

Summary:
The natural gas industry has seen a 50% increase in use in the past decade, making it the second-highest emitter of methane gas, prompting the proposal of a Global Methane Pledge to reduce emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030.

The ‘Earth Summit’ con- cluded that the concept of sustainable develop- ment was an attainable goal for all the people of the world, regardless of whether they were at the local, national, regional or international level. It also recognized that integrating and balancing economic, social and environmental concerns in meeting our needs is vital for sustaining human life on the planet and that such an integrated approach is possible. Cc. Clean Affordable Energy — International Solar Alliance (ISA) — ISA is a treaty based inter-gov- _ernmental organization working to create a global market system to tap the benefits of solar power and promote clean energy applications. This was primarily promoted by India and France. it was started in 30 November 2015. D. Intended Nationally Determined Contributions ~ Paris Agreement — This agreement was adopted in 2015. They are essence of the Paris Agreement so that they can facilitate the achievement of long-term objectives of emission reduction, bet- ter energy measures, forest resources, etc. INDCs embody efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The long term objective is to hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C, to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C, and to achieve net zero emissions in the second half of this century.

‘We must at present do our best to form a class of persons, Indian in blood and col- our, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect’. (a): Nalanda University is the correct answer. Nal- - anda is an ancient center of higher learning in Bihar from 427 to 1197. Nalanda was established in the 5th century AD in Bihar, India. A new Nalanda University has been recently devel- oped in Bihar in 2010. Xuan Zang (or call him Hiuen Tsang) visited Nalanda University in 7th century. He stayed and travelled in India for sixteen years. He translated Buddhist scrip- tures. He also studied logic, Sanskrit grammar, Yogac- ara in India. He opposed Samkhya and Vaiseshika that he found to be opposing Budhhist philosophy. According to I-Quing, there were followers of both “vehicles” - Hinayana and Mahayana. Northern India and most of the islands of the South Seas (such as Sumatra, Java — parts of present Indonesia) practiced Hinayana. The Buddhists in China and Malayu prac- ticed Mahayana. 1. For future questions, note that Fa-Hien was the first Chinese traveller to visit India in the early fifth century. The purpose of his visit was to look for texts sacred to Buddhism. 2. Taxila university was one of the oldest universi- ties of the world. 3. Nalanda University is a public central/union uni- versity located in Rajgir in Nalanda district in the state of Bihar. It is designated as an Institute of National Importance (INI) and excellence. This international university is supported by 18 mem- ber countries was established by an Act of the Indian Parliament in 2010. The President of India serves as the Visitor to Nalanda University.

Pierre and Marie’s amicable collabora. - tion later helped to unlock the secrets of the atom, Together with her husband Pierre, she was awarded the Noble Prize for Physics in 1903. Marie was born in Warsaw, Poland on 7 November 1867, the daughter of a Physics teacher. At an early age, she displayed a brilliant mind and a blithe per- sonality. Her great exuberance for learning prompted her to continue with her studies after high school. She became disgruntled, however, when she learned that the university in Warsaw was closed to women. Deter- mined to receive a higher education, she defiantly left Poland and in 1891 entered the Sorbonne, a French University, where she earned her master’s degree and doctorate in Physics. Marie was fortunate to have studied at the Sorbonne with some of the greatest scientists of her day, one of whom was Pierre Curie. Marie and Pierre were mar- ried in 1895 and spent many productive years work- ing together in the physics laboratory.

Summary:
Inferences based on uniformity of co-existence can lead to fallacies, and fallacies occur when any of the five characteristics of a middle term are violated, while malware examples include worms and viruses, and Marie Curie, a famous scientist, discovered radium with her husband Pierre and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903.

nne with some of the greatest scientists of her day, one of whom was Pierre Curie. Marie and Pierre were mar- ried in 1895 and spent many productive years work- ing together in the physics laboratory. A short time after they discovered radium, Pierre was killed by a horse-drawn wagon in 1906. Marie was stunned by the horrible misfortune and endured heartbreaking anguish. Despondently she recalled their close rela- tionship and the joy that they had shared in scientific research. The fact that that she had two young daugh- ters to raise by herself greatly increased her distress. Curie’s feeling of desolation finally began to fade when she was asked to succeed her husband as a Physics professor at the Sorbonne. She was the first woman to be given a professorship at the world-famous univer- sity. She received her second Noble Prize in Chemistry for isolating radium, in 1911. Curie’s eldest daughter, Irene, was herself a scientist and winner of the Noble Prize for Chemistry. Although Marie Curie eventually suffered a fatal ill- ness from her long term exposure to radium, she never became disillusioned about her work. Regard- less of the consequences, she had dedicated herself to science and to revealing the mysteries of the physical world. 46, At what age did Marie Curie receive her first Nobel prize?

(c): The percentage of children who were not over- weight in 2016 = 100-30 = 70% Their number = 70/100 x 7500 = 5250 The percentage of children who were not overweight in 2017 = 100-28 = 72% Their number = 72/100 x 10500 = 7560 The total number = 5250 + 7560 = 12810 Thus, (c) is the correct answer. 2. (d): For the year 2019 Number of overweight men = 16% of 33000 16/100 x 33000 = 5280 Number of overweight women = 30% of 27000 30/100 x 27000 = 8100 Number of overweight children = 30% of 8000 30/100 x 8000 = 2400 The total of above three = 5280 + 8100 + 2400 15780 Their average = 15780 / 3 = 5260 Thus (d) is the right answer. 3. (b): If we assume that total number of men in 2021 was 100 Then the number of overweight men = 37.5 The number of not overweight men = 100 - 37.5 = The required percentage = 37.5 / 62.5 x 100=3/5 xX 100 = 60% Thus, (b) is the correct answer 4. (a): For the year 2018 The number of overweight women = 25% of 30000 = 25/100 x 30000 = 7500 The number of overweight children = 35% of 6000 = 35/100 x 6000 = 2100 The total of overweight men and women = 7500 + 2100 = 9600 The number of overweight men = 30% of 31500 = 30/100 x 31500 = 9450 The required difference = 9600 - 9450 = 150 5. (d): The required ratio between overweight women in 2018 and number of overweight men in 2020 = 25% of 30000 : 12% of 35000 = 750: 420 =25:14 Thus, (d) is the correct answer. 6.

called arithmetic logic units (ALU) that are capable of per- forming billions of arithmetic and logic operations every second. ALU is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. This makes the fundamental build- ing block of the CPU of a system. The modern CPUs contain powerful and complex ALUs. Control Unit (CU) - Modern CPUs contain a CU, in addition to ALUs. CU tells the ALU what operation is to be performed on the data. ALU stores the result in an output register. CU moves the data between these registers, the ALU, and memory. Process Registers — ALUs load data from input regis- ters. A register is a small amount of storage available as part of a CPU. The information in a computer is stored and manipu- lated in the form of binary numbers, i.e. 0 and 1 which are managed by Transistor switches which are open or closed.

Psychomotor - doing, or kinesthetic, tactile, hap- tic or hand/body Bloom’s Cognitive Taxonomy in 1956 had remained an essential element in teacher training. The updated version was done by Anderson and Krathwohl in 2001. Affective skills were added in 1961 by David Krathwohl. ‘Knowledge Remember Noun--—» to verb Form The revised taxonomy has these elements ~ 1. Remember - Recognizing and Recalling 2. Understand - Interpreting, Exemplifying, Classifying, Summarizing, Inferring, Comparing, Explaining Apply - Executing, Implementing Analyze - Differentiating, Organizing, Attributing Evaluate - Checking, Critiquing au PY Create - Generating, Planning, Producing. (c): Inaspreadsheet application, whenever a cell with a formula is copied over to another cell, any cell refer- ences in the formula will shift as per the relative shift in the references of the copied cell and its destination. The above behaviour can be explicitly disabled by using the ‘$’ character before the column letter or row number or both in the cell references in a formula. We can take a look at what happens to the formula in cells C3 and D2, when they are copied over from C2. Example 1 - C2 contain the formula ‘= A2 + B2’ 1. C3 will get the formula ‘= A3 + B3’ 2. D2 will get the formula ‘= B2 + C2’ Example 2 - C2 contain the formula ‘= $A2 + B$2’ 1. C3 will get the formula ‘= $A3 + B$2’ 2. D2 will get the formula ‘= $A2 + C$2’ In the above example, the column A in the first refer- ence and row number 2 in the second reference were made absolute using the ‘$’ sign in the original for- mula of cell C2. Thus, when C2 was copied over to C3 and D2, the absolute part of both cell references didn’t change in the formula. In the given question, the value of the formula in cell C4 is ‘= $A$3 + B2’. When this formula is copied over to the cell C5, its value would become ‘= $A$3 + B3’, as per the behaviour laid out above. Thus, value of C5 comes out to be 7. 11.

The life and society have become very complex, the situations are diverse, we have to deal with new situations every time. Thus, engage- ‘ment of students in different activities is very important so that there is wholesome development of personality. Education helps us get exposure to new ideas and concepts. A. Emphasize your interpretation approach indi- cates that we may be highly subjective. It is not relevant as we have to deal with open and diverse society. The globalization has happened all around. This type of approach also indicates the feeling of ‘ethnocentrism’. B. Forgetting your own culture means that we as a culture are not participating so that establishing contact with others may not be fruitful. C. An ecosystem of mutual respect creates the feel- ing of trust so that one culture can communicate better with other cultures. D. Knowing the cultural context of other people pro- motes the feeling of ‘cultural relativism’, so that we emphasize that every culture is equally impor- tant. This helps in better communication with other cultures. E. Stating facts means that we believe in transpar- ency and trustworthiness. We are not hiding anything. Thus, (b) is the correct answer. (c): Ignoratio elenchi, is also called as ‘ignorance of the refutation’. Refute means overthrow by argu- ment, evidence, or prove to be false or incorrect or controvert. It is broadly defined as any incorrect === Page 24 === argument which reaches an evidentially irrelevant conclusion. Historically, the fallacy is also more NARROWLY defined as a counterargument to an argument which does not attempt to prove the con- tradictory of what was intended to be proved. In this statement, hunger of knowledge and hunger of food are narrowly linked, without any substantial value. Practically, it functions as a ‘catch-all’ category. The Traditional Form of Ignoratio Elenchi (fallacy of irrelevancy) is occurring here whenever the conclu-_ sion of an argument is irrelevant to its premises.

y, it functions as a ‘catch-all’ category. The Traditional Form of Ignoratio Elenchi (fallacy of irrelevancy) is occurring here whenever the conclu-_ sion of an argument is irrelevant to its premises. The fallacy of non sequitur is often identified with this version. 14. (a): Both statements are true. Statement 1 - Here, we can speak about three mod- els of communication — linear, transactional and interactive. The linear model is transmission of communication - mostly one way communication. So, called as trans- mission model of communication. Transactional Model takes into account social and relational aspects and thus social context. Interactive Models talk about channel (the way mes- sages are sent and received), field of experience, phys- ical context and psychological context. We can take the examples of social media, interactive and online marketing, user generated contents, chat rooms etc. for interactive communication. We always look for immediate feedback. Here, the communication is a process where participants alternate positions as sender and receiver and generate meaning by send- ing messages and receiving feedback within physical and psychological contexts. 1. The continuous feedback is the main element in interactive communication. We are quickly able to understand if a message is received or under- stood. WhatsApp may be taken as an example. 2. There are continuous updates and communica- tion with audiences. 3. There is more transparency in our interactive communication. 4. There are additional alignment opportunities. That was it seems to be extrovert as well. 5. Wecan share information with large audiences. For statement 2 - The interested candidates may look for Bloom Taxonomy once again that comes for digital iconic communication. 15. (c): Internal validity is concerned with correctly con- cluding that an independent variable and not some extraneous variable is responsible for a change in the ‘dependent variable. External validity refers to the generalizability and also to randomisation of the treatment/condition outcomes. A. Randomisation - We need unbiased and objec- tive in our research, and randomisation helps in that.

Title: Importance of Randomisation and Generalisation in Research

Text:
dity refers to the generalizability and also to randomisation of the treatment/condition outcomes. A. Randomisation - We need unbiased and objec- tive in our research, and randomisation helps in that. In simple terms, randomization eliminates predictability. It follows the theory of probability, This removes the possibility of any kind of human interruption by the researcher. Randomization eliminates accidental bias, including selection bias. Assume that a teacher has to select 10 students out of 100 for a research purpose, they can be any ten. Everyone in the class stands 1/100 chance of selection which are equal for anyone. This equal chance of being selected is called as randomisation. B. Generalisation — It means that results of a research study are applicable to the outer world. That is called as the external validity. Cc. Maturation -— The processes within subjects act as a function of the passage of time. This happens when study is conducted on people which are base of research findings. If that element changes over a period of time, it threatens the internal validity of the research. D. History — This refers to any event other than the ‘independent variable’. History--the specific events which occur between the first and second measurement. E. Instrumentation - The reliability of the instru- — ment used to gauge the dependent variable or manipulate the independent variable may change in the course of an experiment. Thus, internal validity may be threatened. Both A and B facilitate the objectivity, unbiasedness and validity of research. The question is about the threat to internal validity in research. In this case, these factors also matter for future questions. 1. Testing - first test affecting the subsequent tests 2. Statistical regression - candidates with extreme scores, for example, choosing the poorest or the most intelligent students in the class 3. Experimental mortality - that is the loss of subjects 4. Selection of subjects - the biases which may result in selection of comparison groups. Randomisation can help in minimisation of this effect. When the sample size is small, randomization may lead to Simpson Paradox.

Summary:
Randomisation and generalisation are important factors in research to ensure objectivity and validity, while other threats to internal validity such as maturation, history, and instrumentation must also be considered.

These courses are devel- oped by reputed teachers in the country and available free of cost. By integrating SWAYAM MOOCs with conventional education the learning outcomes of the students are expected to improve in coming days. (a): Statement 1 - The agenda of sustainable devel- opment is being carried forward with the help of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which aim to bring peace and prosperity to all people by 2030. They started in the year 2015. This Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. It also seeks to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom. Ear- lier there were Millennium Development Goals which were set for a period between 2000 to 2015. There are the 17 SDGs which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing. In simple terms, sustainable development means integrating the economic, social and environmental objectives of society, in order to maximise human well-being in the present, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Statement 2 - Anthropogenic model is the root cause for taking sustainable development agenda more seri- ously. Anthropogenic activities is the human interrup- tion in nature for the sake of development to make the human life comfortable but these activities bring mis- ery also in the form of pollution, hazards etc. We need to have a look at the following diagram. === Page 26 === New species of cultivated plants Forest and other Fires Unsustainable deforestations Anthropogenic Activities contributing to Environmental Degradation Constructions (Concretization) Genetic Modification (GM) Variety of Pollutant: Unplanned Waste Management Increase in Food intake 21.

Title: The Fallacy of False Cause and Examples of Mislocating Causes

Text:
The fallacy of false cause (non causa pro causa) © mislocates the cause of one phenomenon in another that is only seemingly related. The example taken in the question statement are very much natural. The moon is able to shine during the night as it gets light from sun that is reflected back. (b):. Hermeneutics is the art of understanding and interpretation of texts, specifically religious ones. Hermeneutics is philosophical and theological in nature. The history of hermeneutics stretches across epochs, methods and all the disciplines in the human- ities, social sciences, and even the natural sciences. It can be identified with four major strands: conserva- tive, critical, radical, and moderate. Sociologyis linked with society, groups and social insti- tutions. Anthropology is the study of human beings in its entirety.-Economics deals with wealth related issues in the form of micro and macro- economics. === Page 27 === 25. 26. (d): Anthropogenic means human interruption in environment for the sake of development. It is basi- cally based on environment possibilism so that humans are to determine which way the environment should go. Earlier there was concept of environmen- tal determinism that said that ultimately the environ- ment should decide its own way. We need to look at all the events. Cyclones —- They are linked with sea water tem- perature and pressure conditions. The more about cyclones has been discussed in the earlier paper. The frequency of cyclones has increased during recent decades. Nuclear Disasters - In a major nuclear disaster, a reactor core is damaged and significant amounts of radioactive isotopes are released which may result in loss of lakhs of lives. The major such examples are Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. The largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, is located in Ukraine, and has been a major flashpoint for nuclear disaster. Floods — The frequency of floods has increased during the recenttimes as the natural way of water has been disrupted due to concretization of natural resources in the form of buildings, roads, factories etc.

Summary:
The fallacy of false cause mislocates the cause of one phenomenon in another that is only seemingly related, with examples ranging from the moon shining at night due to reflected sunlight to the impact of human intervention in the environment on natural disasters such as cyclones, nuclear disasters, and floods.

Title: Impact of Human Activities on Natural Disasters and Importance of Communication Feedback

Text:
— The frequency of floods has increased during the recenttimes as the natural way of water has been disrupted due to concretization of natural resources in the form of buildings, roads, factories etc. Defor- estation has happened in a big way. There are more and more flash floods which cause more destruction. Voleanoes — They erupt from within the earth as per the temperature and pressure conditions of the earth, so anthropogenic activities do not play any role in it. Forest Fires ~ That is basically burning of forest trees on a massive scale. (a): Let’s discuss the main aspects of communication and feedback. Communication is the main source of interaction between people by which they-share their ideas, and thoughts with each other. Communication is important in every aspect of life. The communica- tion can be verbal, nonverbal or through by the use - of sign language or body language. Feedback can be referred as ‘fed-back’. Feedback means that response is generated. Feedback can be in the form of non-verbal cues pro- vided by the receiver. Thus, feedback fulfils the basic objective of two-way communication. The importance of feedback can be gauzed from the following facts. 1. The element of feedback should always be there to make the communication effective. Feedback is effective listening. Feedback can motivate. Feedback can improve performance. Feedback is a tool for continued learning. Vb wWN 28. The feedback can be of following types: j. Negative feedback: It reflects about mistakes, errors during the process of communication, the areas which have not been understood properly and improvements required. — 2. Positive feedback: There is proper understand-. ing of the message conveyed by sender. 3. Negative feedforward: These are basically cor- rective comments about future behaviour of the work and communication. 4. Positive feedforward: These affirm about the future events. (b): The question papers are made with the perspec- tive of evaluation and assessment of candidates. Objectivity - This can be taken as the main element of a good question paper. They should be constructed for the sake of qualifying an exam or the ranking of candidates.

Summary:
The increase in floods is attributed to disruptions in the natural water flow caused by urban development and deforestation, while volcanoes and forest fires are natural phenomena unaffected by human activities, and effective communication and feedback are essential for successful interaction and learning.

and assessment of candidates. Objectivity - This can be taken as the main element of a good question paper. They should be constructed for the sake of qualifying an exam or the ranking of candidates. Subjectivity - This means that question paper setter may be biased so that a particular set of candidates get benefited from this. Reliability — This refers to the consistency of a meas- ure (whether the results can be reproduced under the same conditions). Validition — This refers to the accuracy of a measure (whether the results really do represent what they are supposed to measure). From a research perspective, objectivity, reliability and validity are important characteristics. (a): Material Fallacies There are five characteristics of a valid middle term; they are as following: 1. Paksadharmata - The must be present in the minor term. For example, smoke must be present in the hill. 2. Sapaksasattva - It must be present in all positive instances in which the major terms are present. For example, the smoke must be present in the kitchen where fire exists. 3. Vipaksasattva - It must be absent in all nega- tive instances in which the major terms is absent. For example smoke must be absent in the lake in which fire does not exist. 4. Abadhita - It must be non-incompatible with the minor term. For example, it must not prove the coolness of fire. 5. Aviruddha - It must be qualified by the absence of counteracting reasons which lead to a contra- dictory conclusion. For example, ‘the fact of being caused’ should not be used to prove the ‘eternal- ity’ of sound. Whenever, one of these characteristics is violated, the fallacies take its place. It also says that the validity of === Page 28 === an inference depends on the validity of hetu or rea- son. It is because of this fact that Naiyayikas consider fallacies of inference as fallacies of the reason (hetv- abhasa). Fallacies of inference thus are all MATERIAL fallacies. Fallacies of reason are of five types — Asiddha, Savyab- hichara, Satpratipaksha, Badhita and Virudha. They have been discussed as the last topic in Unit 6 of Pear- son book.

Summary:
Objectivity, reliability, and validity are important characteristics in the assessment of candidates, with material fallacies being identified as violations of the five characteristics of a valid middle term in question papers.

Text:
e all MATERIAL fallacies. Fallacies of reason are of five types — Asiddha, Savyab- hichara, Satpratipaksha, Badhita and Virudha. They have been discussed as the last topic in Unit 6 of Pear- son book. Material fallacies are also known as fallacies of presumption, because the premises ‘presume’ too much—they either covertly assume the conclusion or avoid the issue in view. Reason — The Nyaya system is formal and is deduc- tive-inductive can be understood through the follow- ing example (For such fallacies, we can refer to the last topic of discussion in Unit 6.). (d): This question is quite similar to question number 26 in the previously solved pervious year paper. This is the basic information All Birds are Mammals | No Birds are Affirmat Universal Particular O Some S are Some Birds are Negative not P Not Mammals Now look at the question statement — ‘Some plants are not carnivorous’, that is basically O — type. This is given to be false. A. ‘some plants are carnivorous’ denotes I-type - given to be True in question. B. ‘some plants are carnivorous’ again denotes I- type — given to be False. C. No plants are carnivorous E-type — given to be False D. All plants are carnivorous denotes A-type — given to be True If O-type is false, then looking horizontally, we can say that I-type is True — that denotes that option A is a part of answer. Similarly E as False, that is option C is a part of answer, Aas True, that is option D is also part of answer. That means that A, C and D are part of answer. Thus overall, (d) is the answer. (a): Statement I - Qualitative data is powerful as the most of this is to be collected from human resources whose behaviour is always complex and dynamic. Even the social context is so dynamic and changeable. The behavioural context may even change from one point of time to another. Qualitative data is basically non numeric, and it holds conceptual information. We use their feedback or response to capture their themes and patterns. The answering research ques- tions is difficult. Thus, the whole scene is based on sensitive social, historical and temporal (time based) context.

Summary:
Material fallacies, also known as fallacies of presumption, involve premises that either covertly assume the conclusion or avoid the issue at hand, and are discussed in the last topic of Unit 6 in the Pearson book on Nyaya system reasoning.

ack or response to capture their themes and patterns. The answering research ques- tions is difficult. Thus, the whole scene is based on sensitive social, historical and temporal (time based) context. Statement II - Obtaining right kind of information in a set of complex situations through customer inter- views, surveys, and feedback. Context sensitivity takes the surroundings into consideration while plan- ning for the research. It takes into account community values and assets. We can look at the following types of approaches to deal with the qualitative data so that we get the right kind of information. This may be useful for the future questions. 1. Content analysis —- This element examines and quantifies the presence of certain words, subjects, and concepts in text, image, video, or audio mes- sages. The method transforms qualitative input into quantitative data to help you make reliable conclusions. This can be used for quantitative data as well. 2. Thematic analysis — This can only be applied to qualitative data, and focuses on identifying pat- terns and ‘themes’. This can be done with innova- tive tools such as Dovetail and Thematic. 3. Narrative analysis - This method used to inter- pret research participants’ stories—things like testimonials, case studies, interviews, and other text or visual data. 4. Grounded theory analysis — This is a method of conducting qualitative research to develop theo- ries by examining real-world data. 5. Discourse analysis — This is the act of research- ing the underlying meaning of qualitative data. It involves the observation of texts, audio, and vid- eos to study the relationships between the infor- mation and its context. (c): Assertion — Cyclones cause an amazing rise in the sea level. Cyclones are composite phenomena, consisting of winds, multiple storm waves, storm === Page 29 === 32. 33. 34. surges (which generally last from several hours up to a day) and inland flooding generated by heavy rain- fall. This inland flooding often causes more fatalities than the wind. Cyclones generally cause massive erosion or deposition — both long- and cross-shore.

Summary:
The research process involves obtaining information through various methods such as customer interviews and surveys, and analyzing qualitative data using approaches like content analysis, thematic analysis, narrative analysis, grounded theory analysis, and discourse analysis to understand themes and patterns within a sensitive social, historical, and temporal context.

and inland flooding generated by heavy rain- fall. This inland flooding often causes more fatalities than the wind. Cyclones generally cause massive erosion or deposition — both long- and cross-shore. The forestations and green belts such as mangroves usually protect us from the damage. Reason ~ There are four stages of a cyclone - Forma- tive Stage, Immature Stage, Mature Stage and Decay- ing Stage. A landfall happens when the centre of the storm moves across the coast. It often carries heavy winds, lashing rains, increasing sea level that can pose threat to people living in the neighbouring region. Once a cyclone makes landfall, it gets separated from its ocean energy sources. When tropical cyclones reach a land surface, they begin to lose their energy and die out. This is because they are no longer receiv- ing heat energy and moisture from the ocean, which is needed to drive them. (a): The National Council for Technical Educa- tion was enacted in 1993 and was set up in 1995. According to Government sources - the main objec- tive of the NCTE is to achieve planned and coordi- nated development of the teacher education system throughout the country, the regulation and proper maintenance of Norms and Standards in the teacher education system and for matters connected there- with. It includes the whole gamut of teacher educa- tion programmes including research and training of persons for equipping them to teach at pre-primary, primary, secondary and senior secondary stages in schools, and non-formal education, part-time edu- cation, adult education and distance (correspond- ence) education courses. (a): Earth is known as ‘Water Planet’, as our planet has more water than land. 1. In reality, less than three percent of Earth’s water is fresh water, and most of that three percent is inaccessible. 2. Over 68 percent of the FRESH WATER on Earth is found in ice and snow (including glaciers). 3. Almost 30 percent of FRESH WATER is found in ground water. 3. Only about 0.3 percent of FRESH WATER is found in the surface water of lakes, rivers, and swamps. 4. In totality, more than 99 percent of Earth’s water is unusable by humans and many other living things.

Summary:
Inland flooding caused by heavy rainfall during cyclones often results in more fatalities than the wind, and the National Council for Technical Education aims to regulate and maintain standards in teacher education programs throughout the country.

y about 0.3 percent of FRESH WATER is found in the surface water of lakes, rivers, and swamps. 4. In totality, more than 99 percent of Earth’s water is unusable by humans and many other living things. As the question is in the form of increasing quantity, (a) is the correct answer. (c): Historical research is basically a descriptive study, which mostly is a qualitative study. The problem identification is the first thing that should be done in any research. So, this can be taken as the rnain objective. Analytical synthesis means first probing all the aspects of research study and then integrating them in a desirable manner. Universal Generalisation is an act of reasoning that involves drawing broad inferences from particular observations. It is widely-acknowledged as a qual- ity standard in quantitative research. The chances of generalisation are limited in qualitative research. 35. (ce): Energy is the golden thread that connects economic growth, increased social equity, and environmental sustainability that allows the world to thrive. The indicator for Energy Intensity is in terms of total pri- mary energy supply and GDP at PPP. Under target number 7 of Sustainable Development Goals, we need to double the global rate of improve- ment in energy efficiency by the year 2030. 36. (d): Phenomenology - This is a qualitative research approach that seeks to understand and describe the universal essence of a phenomenon. The approach investigates the everyday experiences: of human beings while suspending the researchers’ precon- ceived assumptions about the phenomenon. Ethnography ~- In this. qualitative research, a researcher or an ethnographer study a particular social/cultural group with the aim to understand it better. They actively participate in the group in order to gain an insider’s perspective of the group. He may try to get the equivalent experience that is similar to the group members. There are experiences relating to process, participation, data collection, interviews, and the analysis of documents and artifacts. Ethnomethodology — This is the study of how social order is produced in and through processes of social interaction.

Summary:
Less than 0.3 percent of fresh water is found in surface water, with over 99 percent of Earth's water being unusable by humans, and energy is seen as a key factor connecting economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability.

cipation, data collection, interviews, and the analysis of documents and artifacts. Ethnomethodology — This is the study of how social order is produced in and through processes of social interaction. It generally seeks to provide an alterna- tive to mainstream sociological approaches. Symbolic interactionism — This counsels us that a complex social situation like triangulated research involves much more than simply forging a rational design among fairly like-minded colleagues, since participants must work hard to create a working, shared understanding of their research. 37. (d): According to Government sources - DigiLocker is a flagship initiative of Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY) under Digital India programme. DigiLocker aims at ‘Digital Empowerment of citizen by providing access to authentic digital documents to citizen’s digi- tal document wallet.

Benefits to Citizens j. Important Documents Anytime, Anywhere! 2. Authentic Documents, Legally at Par with Originals. 3. Digital Document Exchange with the consent of the citizen. 4. Faster service Delivery- Government Benefits, Employment, Financial Inclusion, Education, Health. Benefits to Agencies Reduced Administrative Overhead: Aimed at the concept of paperless governance. It reduces the administrative overhead by minimizing the use of paper and curtailing the verification process. Digital Transformation: Provides trusted issued doc- uments. Issued Documents available via DigiLocker are fetched in real-time directly from the issuing agency. Secure Document Gateway: Acts as a secure docu- ment exchange platform like payment gateway between trusted issuer and trusted Requester/Verifier with the consent of the citizen. , Real Time Verification: Provides a verification mod- ule enabling government agencies to verify data directly from issuers after obtaining user consent.

Summary:
Ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism are sociological approaches that study social order and interaction, while DigiLocker is a digital initiative by the Ministry of Electronics & IT that aims to provide citizens with access to authentic digital documents and reduce administrative overhead through paperless governance.

(c): The natural ability to live or work together in harmony because of well-matched characteristics is called as compatibility between individuals. (a) Stewardship is an ethical value that embodies the responsible planning and management of resources. 40. 41. (b) Interest in media for two individuals may not develop in compatibility. Between two individu- als, one may be interested in football matches, and other one in serials. (c) Empathy is shown in how much compassion and understanding we can give to another. Sympathy is more of a feeling of pity for another. Empathy is our ability to understand how someone feels while sympathy is our relief in not having the same problems. , (d) External influence may help in temporary asso- ciation, and not in compatibility. (b): Non Conventional Learning Programmes- The education system in which teaching-learning activities is offered other than the on-campus with fixed time classrooms. For examples, evening learn- ing, distance learning, vocational studies, skill-based — courses, online learning, etc. Non-conventional education is inspired by the P.H. Coombs, and Ahmed who has worked on non-formal education for the poor. Characteristics of Non-conventional learning e Learners oriented ¢ No fixed curriculum * Cost-effective e Linked to employment e Continuous e For improvement of Quality Target groups of non-conventional education are unemployed youths, the school dropped out, under- privileged group, women and girls, Tribal and Minor- ity population. This type of education is also for literacy programmes. (b): Let the number of birds on Tree A = A And birds of Tree B = B In first situation — if two birds shift from B to A, then birds on A and B will be equal. B-2=A+2 A-B=-4...... (1).

Summary:
Real Time Verification enables government agencies to verify data directly from issuers with user consent, stewardship is responsible planning and management of resources, empathy is understanding someone's feelings while sympathy is feeling pity, and non-conventional learning programs offer education outside of traditional on-campus classrooms.

(1). In second situation — If 2 birds shift from A to B, then birds on B will be double than those on A. Here, we are doubling the birds on A so that both on A and B are equal. 2(A-2) =B+2 2A-4=B+2 2A-B=2+4=6 === Page 31 === Deducting 2 from 1 A-B-(2A-B) =-4-6 -1A = -10 Putting A = 10 in equation (1) 10-B = -4 -B = -4-10 B= 14 Now, A=10, B= 14, thus (b) is the answer. The question can be solved directly from the answer by adding and reducing the values. 2. (d): Grapevine communication is basically informal in nature so that more and more people feel comforta- ble in it. They get connected in it, they feel connected to informal groups where they express themselves. Thus, informal communication boosts the morale of the employees. In the grapevine, employees discuss various issues. The anxieties of the employees are also expressed. The formal communication moves in a set direction, so employees are bound by rules and regulations. 3. (b): Basically, criterion of valid knowledge is called as pramana. The inference of one proposition from two premises is called as syllogism. Any error of reason- ing is called as fallacy. In nyaya system, it is called as hetvabhasa. The aspects A and B have been discussed in an earlier question. C. hetu (causation) is missing, (it may seem more like inductive). D. Linga paramarsa: The Nyaya syllogism has five terms. Among them, middle term works as a bridge between the major and the minor terms. Therefore, the middle term has main responsibil- ity to prove a syllogism valid or invalid. How a middle term is related to major term is lingapara- marsha. There are five characteristics of a middle term: 1. Paksadharmata - it must be present in the minor term. For example, smoke must be present in the hill. 2. Sapaksasattva - It must be present in all positive instances in which the major terms are present. For example, the smoke must be present in the kitchen where fire exists. 3.

Summary:
The passage discusses various topics including a mathematical problem involving birds on trees, the importance of informal communication in boosting employee morale, and the criteria for valid knowledge in the Nyaya system.

For example, the smoke must be present in the kitchen where fire exists. 3. Vipaksasattva - It must be absent in all negative instances in which the major terms are absent. For example smoke must be absent in the lake in which fire does not exist. 4. Abadhita - It must be non-incompatible with the minor term. For example, it must not prove the coolness of fire. 5. Aviruddha - It must be qualified by the absence of counteracting reasons which lead to a contra- dictory conclusion. For example, ‘the fact of being caused’ should not be used to prove the ‘eternal- ity’ of sound. The above five are linked with Hetvabhasa or types of it. In Indian logic a fallacy is called hetvahasa. It means that middle term appears to be a reason but is not a valid reason. All fallacies are material fallacies. We have mentioned the five characteristics of a valid middle term. When these are violated, we have falla- cies. Five kinds of fallacies are recognised. 1. Assiddha or sadhyasama - This is the fallacy of unproved middle. 2. Savyabhicara - This is the fallacy of irregular middle. 3. Satpratipaksa - Here the middle term is contra- dicted by another middle term. 4. Badhita - It is the non-inferentially contradicted middle. 5. Viruddha - It is the contradictory middle. 44.

Montessori Method: This was developed by Dr. Maria Montessori (1907) is based on the idea of self-education. The child does not sit still and idle to the lessons taught by the teacher, here, in this system, the child educates himself or herself, but with the teacher as a guide. The child uses hands-on materials and specially prepared classrooms to develop both intellect and character.

Summary:
The validity of a middle term in Indian logic is determined by its presence in positive instances, absence in negative instances, non-incompatibility with the minor term, and qualification by the absence of counteracting reasons, with fallacies arising when these criteria are violated.

re, in this system, the child educates himself or herself, but with the teacher as a guide. The child uses hands-on materials and specially prepared classrooms to develop both intellect and character. This type of self-actualization of students is called “normalization.” This classroom system is suitable in theory for all ages but mostly practiced by preschoolers and kindergartners. There is respect for feelings of child, the way he/she wants to educate matters. B. Integral Education, as envisioned by the Mother and Sri Aurobindo, regards the child as a grow- ing soul and helps him to bring out all that is best, most powerful, most innate and living in his nature. It helps the child develop all facets of his === Page 32 === personality and awaken his latent possibilities so that he acquires —astrong, supple, healthy, beautiful body —a sensitive, emotionally refined, energetic personality - a wide-ranging, lively intelligence and will -—the subtler spiritual qualities that unify and harmonise the being around the child’s inmost Truth or Soul. The focus and emphasis in Integral Education (IE) is not just information and skills acquisition but also self-development, triggered from within the child and supported and nourished by teachers and parents. Every experience becomes a learning tool for the child in its growth. IE helps the child to integrate with its true Self, its surroundings, its society, its country and humanity; in other words, to become the complete being, the integral being that the child is meant to be.

Leadership lore is defined as an influence relationship among lead- ers and followers who want real change and outcomes that reflect their shared purpose. Leadership involves influence. It occurs among people; those people who intentionally desire significant changes, and the changes reflect purpose shared by the leaders and their followers. Influence means that the relationship among people is not passive; however, also part of this definition is that influence is multidirectional. It does not use orders or threats to make somebody do something. The basic cul- tural values in America make it easiest to think of leader- ship as something a leader does to a follower. However, leadership has an effect in both directions. In most orga- nizations, superiors influence subordinates, but subordi- nates also influence superiors.

In addition, the changes sought are not dictated by leaders, but reflect purposes that leaders and followers share. Moreover, change is toward an outcome that the _ leaders and follower both want; a desired future or shared purpose that motivates them toward this more preferable outcome. An important aspect of leadership is influencing others to come together around a common vision. Thus, leadership involves the influence of people to bring about change toward a desirable future. 46.

Exports by country S during 2017-2020 = 28 + 28 + 21 + 32 = 109 Exports by country T during 2017-2020 = 31 + 33 + 23 +28 = 115 Thus, required ratio of exports between S and T = 109/115 - (d) As per question, the profit percentage increase by dif- ferent countries between 2019 and 2020 is to be cal- culated first. For Country P Profit in 2019 = 36-28 = 8 Profit in 2020 = 32-22 = 10 Percentage increase = (10-8) /8x100 =2/8x100 = 25% For Country Q Profit in 2019 = 37-29 = 8 Profit in 2020 = 34-26=8 Percentage increase = (8-8) /8x 100 = 0/8x 100 For Country R Profit in 2019 = 36-32 = 4 Profit in 2020 = 34-28 = 6 Percentage increase = (6-4) /4x 100 = 2/4x 100 = 50% As per question, the profit percentage increase by dif- ferent countries between 2019 and 2020 For Country S Profit in 2019 = 21-16=5 Profit in 2020 = 32-23 =9 Percentage increase = (9-5) /5x 100 = 4/5x100 = 80% For Country T Profit in 2019 = 23-12 = 11 Profit in 2020 = 28-21 =7 Percentage increase = (7-11) /11x100 = Reduction Thus, country S has shown the maximum increase in profit. (b) As.every figure is to be divided by 5 (number of years) to calculate average imports, we may get the answer _ directly by total as well, and thus save time. The total imports during different years are: Imports during 2017 = 25 + 28 + 24 + 22+ 26 = © 125 Imports during 2018 = 24+ 26+ 28+ 18+ 16= Imports during 2019 = 28 + 29+ 324+ 164+12= Imports during 2020 = 22 + 26+ 28+ 23+ 21= Thus, the minimum average imports were in the year 2018. Thus, the answer is (b). - (d) As every figure is to be divided by 5 (number of years) to calculate average exports, we may get the answer directly by total as well, and thus save time.

Summary:
There may be aberrations in some questions, but the required ratio of exports between countries S and T is 109/115, country S showed the maximum increase in profit between 2019 and 2020, and the minimum average imports were in the year 2018.

The total exports during different years are: Exports during 2017 = 30 + 26 + 32+ 28+ 31 = Exports during 2018 = 32 + 31+ 25+ 28+ 33 = Export during 2019 = 36+ 37 + 36+ 21+ 23=153 Export during 2020 = 32 + 34 + 34+ 32 + 28 = 160 The maximum average exports were in the year 2020. Thus, the answer is (d}. (b) The average exports by country P = 30 + 32 + 36 + 32 = 1830/4 = 32.5 The average imports by country P = 25 + 24 + 28 + 22 = 99/4 = 24.75 Difference = 32.5 — 24.75 = 7.75. (b) ICT ASCII Code: Computers work in binary code. Information is coded using Os and 1s. Each 0 or 1 is called a bit. In the early years of computer development, different computer companies applied the binary system in their own way. Eventually, a set of standards was developed. Com- puter manufactures agreed to use one code called the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). ASCII is an 8-bit code. That is, it uses eight bits to represent a letter or a punctuation mark. Eight bits are called a byte. A binary code with eight digits, such as 1101 1101,, can be stored in one byte of computer memory. === Page 39 === 7. (b) Logical Reasoning The knowledge through has been classified into 1. svartha — for oneself — one’s own inferential knowl- edge, through linking it with major and minor premises. 2. parartha — through justification of middle term — inferential knowledge for another. 3. Pararthanumana — If the motive is for demon- strating the truth of the conclusion to others it is called as Pararthanumana. Here, conclusion is arrived at through justification of the middle term that leads to it. Aman having inferred the existence of fire in a hill lays it down as a thesis and proves it as a conclusion following from the major and minor premises and their combination into a third premise. The latter has a five membered syllogism viz., pratijna, hetu, udaha- rana, upanaya and nigamana.

Though Vatsyayana disagreed with the first five and stated them as irrelevant. (b) Research Aptitude Statement II is the solution for Statement I. For this purpose, we conduct exploratory study that is more useful in qualitative research. In Statement II, there is list of steps in exploratory study. Research is a continuous process that needs improve- ment with the passage of time, thus it is non— exhaustive. Exploratory research mostly deals with qualitative data. Most of the researchers work on existing theories or formulations and build on them. Some researchers are motivated to work on a problem that has not been studied very clearly to establish pri-. orities, develop operational definitions and improv- ing the final research design. Much time is spent on exploring the problem so that better insights are built for the future. It usually doesn’t lead to a conclusive result. It starts on a gen- eral idea and we try to specify the related i issues with the topic of the research. Exploratory research is inexpensive, highly interactive and open-ended in nature. There is usually no prior relevant information available from past researchers. Since there is no standard for carrying out explor- atory research, it is usually flexible and scattered.

Summary:
Syllogism involves a series of premises leading to a conclusion, while exploratory research is a continuous process that involves qualitative data and building on existing theories to explore new ideas.

ded in nature. There is usually no prior relevant information available from past researchers. Since there is no standard for carrying out explor- atory research, it is usually flexible and scattered. - (c) Logical Reasoning This question pertains to irregular behaviour of ‘Mid- dle Term’. We can solve other questions, linked directly with Indian philosophy as in the following manner. The fallacies in Anumana that can be termed as hetv- abhasha may occur due to the following: (i) Asiddha: This fallacy occurs due to unproved hetu. It is also called as Paksadharmata. (a) Ashrayasiddha: If Paksha (minor term) itself is unreal, then there cannot be locus of the hetu. For example, The sky—lotus is fragrant, because it is a lotus like any other lotus. (b) Svarupasiddha: It is not possible that Hetu exist in paksa. For example, sound is a quality, because itis visible. (c) Vyapyatvasiddha: This is termed as ‘conditional hetu’. For example, ‘wherever there is fire, there is smoke’. The presence of smoke is because of wet fuel. (ii) Savyabhichara: This is termed as the fallacy of irregular hetu. (a) Sadharana: Here, the hetu is considered too wide. It is present in both sapaksa and vipaksa. ‘The hill has fire because it is knowable’, (b) Asadharana: Here, the hetu is considered too narrow. It is present only in the Paksha. It is not pres- ent in the Sapaksa and in the Vipaksha. For example, ‘sound is eternal because it is audible’. (c) Anupasamhari: (iii) Satpratipaksa: In this case, one hetu is contra- dicted by another hetu. In case, both have equal force, then nothing should follow. For example, ‘sound is eternal, because it is audible’, and ‘sound is non— eternal, because it is produced’, The word, ‘audible’ is counterbalanced by ‘produced’, Here, ‘audible’ and ‘produced’ carry the equal force. (iv) Badhita: Here, the another proof (as defined by perception) definitely contradicts and disproves the middle term (hetu). For example, ‘fire is cold because it is a substance’. === Page 40 === 10. U1. (v) Viruddha: Here, the virudha, instead of proving something it is proving the opposite. For example, ‘sound is eternal because it is produced’.

Summary:
Exploratory research is flexible and scattered, with no standard method, and fallacies in Anumana can occur due to various reasons such as unproved hetu, contradictory hetu, and hetu that proves the opposite.

For example, ‘sound is eternal because it is produced’. (b) Higher Education System New Education Policy, 2020 proposes a single regula- tor for higher education institutions across the coun- try, that will be called as Higher Education Council of India (HECD). It will have four verticals for its various roles. (i) National Higher Education Regulatory Coun- cil (NHERC): It will function as the common, single point regulator for the higher education sector includ- ing teacher education. It however excludes medical and legal education. (ii) National Accreditation Council (NAC) — a ‘meta—accrediting body’): It will be based primarily on basic norms, public self-disclosure, good governance, and outcomes. It will be carried out by independent accrediting institutions supervised and overseen by NAC. Giii) Higher Education Grants Council (HEGC): It will look into funding and financing of colleges and universities. (iv) General Education Council (GEC): It will frame expected learning outcomes for higher education programmes, also referred to as ‘graduate attributes’. GEC will formulate a National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF). (b) People, Development and Environment Here, we have taken a broad view to deal with future questions. Since 1972, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has been the global authority to set the environmental agenda, the concept of ‘sus- tainable development’ for future generations and an authoritative advocate for the global environment. UNEP is headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya. It has 193 Member States and representatives from civil society, businesses, etc. through the UN Environment Assem- bly, the world’s highest-level decision-making body on the environment.

Summary:
The New Education Policy, 2020 proposes the establishment of the Higher Education Council of India with four verticals for regulation, while the United Nations Environment Programme has been advocating for sustainable development and setting the environmental agenda since 1972.

robi, Kenya. It has 193 Member States and representatives from civil society, businesses, etc. through the UN Environment Assem- bly, the world’s highest-level decision-making body on the environment. UNEP’s Medium—Term Strategy (MTS) articulates its role in delivering the promises of the ‘2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) as well as its outcome document, “The Future We Want.” Through its campaigns, particularly ‘World Environ- ment Day’ (June 5), UNEP raises awareness and advo- cates for effective environmental action. The Day was established in 1972 by the UN at ‘Stockholm Con- ference on the Human Environment’ (5-16 June, 1972). This day is connected with the launch of ‘UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030’. A step further, UNEP can be further linked with UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Conference of Parties (COPs), Kyoto Pro- - tocol, Paris Agreement and COP26 Glasgow meeting 12. 13. 14. asking for Zero Emissions. World seems to have set Year 2050 as the target year for Zero Emissions and India has set Year 2070 for its own emissions during Glasgow COP26 Meeting. (c) Research Aptitude Reflexivity: Research should be classified as a “Mis- sion’, the researchers get in this mission and their own personalities become part of it. Conducting qualitative research, such as fieldwork, changes a researcher in many ways. Through reflexivity, researchers acknowl- edge the changes brought about in themselves as a result of the research process and how these changes have affected the research process. Thus, this reflexiv- ity is an iterative and empowering process. Reflexiv- ity should be recognized as a significant part of the research findings. Thus, it is an analytic attention to the researcher’s role in qualitative research”, it is both a concept and a process. As a concept, it refers to a certain level of consciousness. There are the few basic principles in the linked quali- tative research: (i) Feminist principle (ii) Rights—based research: the respect of human rights of participants during the research process.

Summary:
UNEP in Kenya plays a crucial role in global environmental decision-making and advocacy, including campaigns like World Environment Day, and is connected to key international agreements such as the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, with a focus on achieving Zero Emissions by 2050.

There are the few basic principles in the linked quali- tative research: (i) Feminist principle (ii) Rights—based research: the respect of human rights of participants during the research process. (iii) Participatory research principles: It recognizes that people have expert knowledge and deep insight into their own lives and communities, (c) Communication / Teaching Aptitude This question is linked with feedback in the classroom to make it effective communication. A teacher should be proficient in all four modes of communication — lis- tening, speaking, reading, and writing — and should know how to utilize this proficiency effectively in an educational institute environment. Being able to do this has been proven to impact the success students achieve in their academic lives, as well as the teach- er’s own Career success. (a) Logical Reasoning If ‘all men are mortal’ is true, then .. To deal with such questions, we need to take help from ‘square of opposition’. Contradictories: Contradictory propositions cannot be simultaneously true and false. If one is true, the other is necessarily false and vice versa. That is, if ‘A’ is true, then ‘O’ is false; ‘E’ is false. === Page 1 === Every S is P No Sis P A SO ——_————E Subalterns Coniradictories Subalterns | ——_______ Subcontraries —__——-O Some S is P Some S is not P Contrary: When two universal propositions differ only in quality. By definition, both opposite propo- sitions can be both false and true at the same time. If one of them is true, the other must necessarily be false. If one is false, the other may be true or false. That is, if ‘E’ is true, then ‘A’ is true; ‘T’ is false Sub-contraries: Contrasting propositions can be true simultaneously, but they cannot be false at the same time. If one of them is true, thé other may be true or false, but if one of them is false, the other must be true. That is, if ‘T’ is true, then ‘E’ is true; ‘O’ is true. Sub - alternation: When two prepositions differ only in quantity (one is universal and the other is special), such an opposition is said to be sub — alternation. These propositions may be simultaneously true or simultaneously false.

Summary:
Qualitative research principles include feminist, rights-based, and participatory research, while effective communication and logical reasoning are essential skills for teachers to impact student success.

They are responsible for receiving, analysing, and forwarding data pack- ets among the connected computer networks. On the arrival of a data packet, the router inspects the des- tination address, consults its routing tables to decide the optimal route and then transfers the packet along this route. A router can be used both in LANs (Local Area Net- works) and WANs (Wide Area Networks). Routers are more expensive than other networking devices like hubs, bridges and switches. Routers are manufactured by some popular companies such as Cisco, D-Link, HP, Nortel etc. A router is a layer 3. or network layer device in OSI Model while data link layer works in the layer 2 of OSI Model. Data link layer is responsible for maintaining the data link between two hosts or nodes. (d) Research Aptitude Survey Research Survey research a research method involving the use of standardized questionnaires or interviews to collect data about people and their preferences, thoughts, === Page 2 === and behaviors in a systematic manner. As surveys are used to collect data from a predefined subject(s), they have been counted under ‘positivism’ approach. The survey as a formal research method was pio- neered in the 1930-40s by sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld to examine the effects of the radio on political opin- ion formation of the United States. This method has since become a very popular method for quantitative research in the social sciences. The survey method can be used for descriptive, exploratory, or explanatory research.

Title: Survey Research: Strengths and Limitations

Text:
United States. This method has since become a very popular method for quantitative research in the social sciences. The survey method can be used for descriptive, exploratory, or explanatory research. Survey research has several inherent strengths com- pared to other research methods due to following reasons. (i) Survey is an excellent vehicle to measure a wide variety of data - people’s preferences (politi- cal orientation), traits (self-esteem), attitudes (toward immigrants), beliefs (about a new law), behaviors (smoking), or factual information (income). (ii) It is ideally suited for remotely collecting data about a population. For example, a large nation such as India or its state UP, MP, Maharashtra that can be covered using mail~in, electronic mail, or telephone surveys. Researches can use well planned sampling to ensure that the popula- tion is adequately represented in a small sample. (iii) Interviews may be the only way of reaching cer- tain population groups such as the homeless or illegal immigrants for which there is no sampling frame available. (iv) Survey research is economical in terms of researcher time, effort and cost than most other methods such as experimental research and case research. At the same time, survey research also has some unique disadvantages. It is subject to a large number of biases such as non-response bias, sampling bias, social desirability bias, and recall bias, etc. Depending on data collection techniques, survey research can be divided into two broad categories: Gi) Questionnaire surveys -— mail-in, group-admin- istered, or online surveys), and (ii) Interview surveys — personal, telephone, or focus group interviews (These have been dis- cussed in detail in second unit of Pearson title for NTA-—NET exam). Constructing a survey questionnaire (or interview- ing) is an art. For the benefit of research students, the following responses to structured questions have been suggested. (i) Dichotomous response — responses such as true/ false, yes/no, or agree/disagree. Is MSP required for crops — Yes / No (ii) Nominal response — more than two unordered options.

Summary:
Survey research is a popular method for quantitative research in the social sciences, allowing for the collection of a wide variety of data from populations through methods such as questionnaires and interviews, although it is subject to biases and requires careful construction of survey instruments.

have been suggested. (i) Dichotomous response — responses such as true/ false, yes/no, or agree/disagree. Is MSP required for crops — Yes / No (ii) Nominal response — more than two unordered options. What is your industry of employment: manu- facturing / supply chain / consumer services / retail / education. (iii) Ordinal response — more than two ordered options. What is your highest level of education: high school / college degree / graduate studies/ PG / PhD. (iv) Interval-level response — When respondents are presented with a 5-point or 7—point Likert scale, semantic differential scale, or Guttman scale etc. (v) Continuous response — When respondents enter a continuous (ratio-scaled) value with a meaning- ful zero point, such as their age or tenure in a firm. These responses generally tend to be of the fill-in—the blanks type. The survey questions should be stated in a very sim- ple language, preferably in active voice, and without complicated words or jargon so that they are clearly understandable by a typical respondent. Questions must not be biased and too much detailed. Double-barreled questions are those that can have multiple answers. For example, are you satisfied with the hardware and software provided for your work? Question should not be presumptuous such as on taxes — too high or too low. Avoid questions with built-in presumptions. ‘Question sequencing’ should be proper, such as questions should flow logically from one to the next. Role of interviewer should be motivational for respon- dents. They should make a good questionnaire. Just pausing and waiting (without going into the next question) may suggest to respondents that the interviewer is waiting for more detailed response. It is called as ‘silent probe’. The interviewer can try the psychotherapist’s trick of repeating what the respondent said is called as ‘Reflection’. Five common biases in survey research are non— response bias, sampling bias (excluding some peo- ple who don’t have some resources such as mobile - phone), social desirability bias (avoid negative opin- ions), recall bias (subjects’ motivation, memory, and ability to respond).

Summary:
Different types of responses in surveys include dichotomous, nominal, ordinal, interval-level, and continuous, with guidelines for creating unbiased and clear questions and avoiding common biases in survey research.

ate ideas effectively and work well with others. This not only helps them personally and education- ally, but eventually professionally as well. Thus, a global education in the classroom is paramount. (b) Communication ‘The medium is the message’ is an expression coined by Canadian educator Marshall McLuhan that is often interpreted to mean that the “media” used to commu- nicate information have a significant impact on the messages they deliver. The form of a message (print, visual, musical, etc.) determines the ways in which 23. that message will be perceived. Modern electronic communications (including radio, television, films, and computers) would have far-reaching sociologi- cal, aesthetic, and philosophical consequences, to the point of actually altering the ways in which we experi- ence the world. {c) Mathematical Reasoning and Aptitude We can solve this question, by counting all the items with the difference d (i.e 175 — 168 = 182-175) Or by using the following formula of Arithmetic Progression a, = 266,a = 168 andd =7 Formula: a, = a + (n-1)d 266 = 168 + (n-1)7 n-1 = (266-168) /7 = 98/7 = 14 n=14+1=15 Thus, (c) is the correct answer. - (c) Mathematical Reasoning and Aptitude The highest denominator in options is 80. We will make every fraction equal to 80. 11/16 x 5/5 = 55/80 29/40 x 2/2 = 58/80 5/8 = 5/8 x 10/10 = 50/80 65/80 — no change required. Now every fraction has 80 as denominator, we need to compare only numerators to compare. Thus 5/8 is the smallest fraction. (d) Research Aptitude Non-parametric (and Parametric tests): First, we need to look at some basic difference between para- metric and non-parametric tests. In parametric tests, the parameters are assumed and the population distribution is always known. To cal- culate the central tendency, a mean value is used. In such tests, we assume normal distribution curve (bell shaped curve). For example, if we were to mea- sure the height of people (in a population), we take some sample, we would see a typical bell-shaped curve. This distribution is also called the Gaussian distribution.

Summary:
Effective communication, mathematical reasoning, and research aptitude are essential skills for success in education and professional life, with a global education in the classroom being crucial for development.

Title: Types of Non-Parametric Tests and Logical Reasoning Fallacies

Text:
For example, if we were to mea- sure the height of people (in a population), we take some sample, we would see a typical bell-shaped curve. This distribution is also called the Gaussian distribution. In statistics, nonparametric tests are methods of sta- tistical analysis that do not require a distribution to meet the required assumptions to be analyzed (espe- cially if the data is not normally distributed). Due to this reason, they are sometimes referred to as distribution-free tests. Parametric tests are generally more powerful than the non-parametric tests, where smaller sample sizes are required in parametric tests. === Page 4 === 24. 25. Types Of Non-Parametric Tests ° 1 Sample Sign Test ¢ 1 Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test ¢ Friedman Test ¢ Goodman Kruska’s Gamma ® Kruskal-Wallis Test ¢ The Mann-Kendall Trend Test ¢ Mann-Whitney Test * Mood’s Median Test * Spearman Rank Correlation (b) Logical Reasoning Exclusive premise: The fallacy of exclusive premises is a syllogistic fallacy committed in a categorical syl- logism that is invalid because both of its premises are negative. Illicit major: Illicit major is a formal fallacy commit- ted in a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its major term is undistributed in the major premise but distributed in the conclusion. O’ type _ Particular negative) ee Etype (Universal Both subject negative) and predicate _ Only predicate Therefore, no dogs are birds. Thus, in premises 1 some birds (major term / subject) are undistributed. In the conclusion dogs (subject) and the birds (predicate) both are distributed. Undistributed middle: The fallacy of the undistrib- uted middle is a formal fallacy that is committed when the middle term in a categorical syllogism is not distributed in either the minor premise or the major premise. It is thus a syllogistic fallacy. Illicit minor: the fallacy of illicit minor term is undis- tributed in the premise but is distributed in the con- clusion (but not vice — versa). (a) Communication Diagonal communication: The communication among the persons at different levels who have no direct relationship is called diagonal relationship.

Summary:
Parametric tests in statistics require data to follow a specific distribution, such as the Gaussian distribution, while nonparametric tests do not have this requirement and are sometimes referred to as distribution-free tests.

con- clusion (but not vice — versa). (a) Communication Diagonal communication: The communication among the persons at different levels who have no direct relationship is called diagonal relationship. This communication is effective as hierarchical bind- ings are removed and there is a free flow of informa- tion, cutting across different positions. Horizontal communication: communication with people at the same level in a hierarchy of peers and colleagues is termed as horizontal communication. This may combine both formal and informal communication. 26. a7. Intrapersonal communication: it is a communica- tion within an individual almost all the times, such as talking to oneself, listening to oneself and relating to oneself. It includes individual reflection, meditation, contemplation and praying to God. Upward communication: This communication is the process of information flowing from the lower levels of a hierarchy to the upper levels. It is the process by which lower-level company employees can directly communicate with upper management to provide feedback, complaints or suggestions regarding the day-to-day operations of the company. (a, b, d) People, Development and Environment Cerebrum: Cerebrum, the largest and uppermost portion of the brain. The cerebrum consists of the cerebral hemispheres and accounts for two-thirds of the total weight of the brain. Hippocampus: It is a small, curved formation in the brain that plays an important role in the limbic sys- tem. It is involved in the formation of new memories and is also associated with learning and emotions. Pons: It is a portion of the hindbrain that connects the cerebral cortex with the medulla oblongata. It also serves as a communications and coordination centre between the two hemispheres of the brain. Thalamus: The thalamus functions as a -relay station in which sensory pathways of the spinal cord and brainstem form synapses on their way to the cere- bral cortex. Specific locations in the thalamus are related to specific areas on the body surface and in the cerebral cortex. (b) Higher Education System Indian Institute of Advance Study (IIAS): This research institute is based in Shimla.

(c) Higher Education system This question is linked with good governance, so linked with public. Data (statistics) and ICT are also going to be part of it. There seems to be some aberra- tion in statement II. (d) Information and Communication Technology This is a direct question of matching. (b) Communication , Technological barrier: low bandwidth of internet is example of technological barrier. Psychological barrier: Complexity of ideas and per- sonal attitude towards technology is an example psy- chological barrier. Geographical barriers: physical locations of com- municators is a geographical barrier.

Summary:
Various research institutes in India, such as the Indian Institute of Advance Study, Indian Biological Science and Research Institute, Indian Institute of Soil Science, and Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research, focus on different areas of study and research in fields such as biosciences, agriculture, and mathematics.

Title: Barriers to Communication and Technology: Understanding Psychological, Geographical, and Semantic Barriers

Text:
l barrier: Complexity of ideas and per- sonal attitude towards technology is an example psy- chological barrier. Geographical barriers: physical locations of com- municators is a geographical barrier. Semantic barrier: communication barriers related to language and the meaning of the words. (a) Mathematical Reasoning and Aptitude Statement I Amount = 280 (1+10/100)(1+5/100) = 280(11/10) (21/20) = ¥ 323.4 Compound Interest = Amount ~ Principal = 323.4-280 = % 43.4 The given answer is % 44.3. Statement II This question is based on simple interest, so interest will be ¥ 5.6 on = 100 every annum. In 15 years, total SI will be 15 x 5.6 = % 84. Thus, amount will not be doubled, but much less than that. Thus, both statements are not correct. (d) Information and Communication Technology In computing, the Post Office Protocol is an applica- tion—layer Internet standard protocol used by e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail from a mail server, POP ver- sion 3 is the version in common use. 35. The Post Office Protocol provides access via an Inter- net Protocol (IP) network for a user client application to a mailbox (maildrop) maintained on a mail server. Thus, the protocol used when receiving emails from the email server. (a) Higher Education System CBCS stands for the choice~based credit system. CBCS grading systems surpass the “conventional per- centage’ and grading means to evaluate a student’s academic skills. CBCS follows a more standardised way of assessment and examination management. CBCS software grading system is uniform across all educational institutes. It follows the semester pattern and not the annual examination pattern. UGC also follows a 10-point grading system, with 0 being absent/fail and 10 being outstanding. Evaluation in choice Based Credit System in Higher Education 0 (Outstanding) A+ (Excellent) B+ (Good) _B (Above Average) a Cc (Average) P(Pass) Ue 4 F (Fail) or Absent (AB) (6) (a) Teaching Aptitude/ ICT DRUPAL: Drupal is a free software package: that allows an individual or a community of users to easily publish, manage and organize a wide variety of con- tent on a website. Drupal is used by mooKIT platform for open source content management system.

Summary:
Various barriers to communication include psychological barriers, geographical barriers, and semantic barriers, while the Post Office Protocol is used for retrieving emails from a mail server, CBCS grading system in higher education follows a standardized assessment method, and Drupal is a free software package for managing website content.

Title: Overview of Content Management Systems and Educational Software

Text:
lows an individual or a community of users to easily publish, manage and organize a wide variety of con- tent on a website. Drupal is used by mooKIT platform for open source content management system. JOOMLA: This uses to build, organize, manage and publish content for websites, blogs, Intranets and mobile applications. Moodle: Moodle is a free and open-source learning management system (LMS) written in PHP and dis- tributed under GNU (General Public licence). Moo- die is used for blended learning, distance education, flipped classroom and other e-learning projects in schools, universities, workplaces and other sectors SAKAI: Sakai is a free, community source, educa- tional software platform designed to support teach- ing, research and collaboration. Systems of this type are also known as Course Management Systems (CMS), Learning Management Systems (LMS), or Vir- tual Learning Environments (VLE). === Page 6 === 36. 37. 38. (d) Information and Communication Technology File Transfer Protocol (FTP): FTP is a standard com- munication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, nor- mally in the form of a username and password. FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) for secure transmission. (a) People, Development and Environment According to Urie Bronfenbrenner’s biological model of human development, microsystem constitutes immediate family, schools:and neighbourhood. (a) People, Development and Environment Statement I: small amount of atmospheric Nitrogen dioxide is produced from polluting sources. NO, is an intermediate in the industrial synthesis of nitric acid. It is largely used in the production of fer- tilisers also. At higher temperatures it is a reddish— brown gas. It can be fatal if inhaled in large quantity. Statement II: Most of the atmospheric NO, is produced due to photochemical reactions in the atmosphere.

Summary:
Various content management systems such as Drupal, Joomla, Moodle, and Sakai are used for publishing, managing, and organizing content on websites, blogs, and educational platforms, with features such as file transfer protocol and environmental considerations also discussed.

Title: Photochemical Reactions and Nitrogen Dioxide: A Deadly Combination

Text:
At higher temperatures it is a reddish— brown gas. It can be fatal if inhaled in large quantity. Statement II: Most of the atmospheric NO, is produced due to photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. Nitrogen dioxide, NO,, present in air is known to be photochemically active due to the presence of an unpaired electron. NO, molecule reaches a higher level of energy when it absorbs a photon of light with energy, which converts the ground state molecule to electronically excited state molecule. NO,, Ozone and PAN show photochemical reactions and photochemi- cal smog is formed. 39.(b) Mathematical Reasoning and Aptitude 40. If each averaged number, X, is multiplied by an another number, Y, then new average will be multipli- cation of those numbers, that is X.Y. Thus, answer to this question will be 7x11 = 77. (b) People, Development and Environment Diarrhoea is a type of waterborne disease which is caused by virus, bacteria and protozoa. The main symptoms. of diarrhea are frequent loose, watery stools and a pressing urge to have a bowel movement. The most common causes of acute and persistent diarrhea are infections, travelers’ diarrhea, and side effects of medicines. Many viruses cause diarrhea, ‘ including norovirus link and rotavirus link. Viral gas- 41. troenteritis is a common cause of acute diarrhea. (c) Teaching Aptitude According to Piaget, the ability to solve conservation 42. 43. problems depends on having an understanding of three basic aspects of reasoning: identity, compensa- tion and reversibility. Jean Piaget mentioned the following stages for cogni- tive development: : (i) Sensory Period (0-2 years) (ii) Pre —- operational period (2-7 years) (iii) Concrete operational period (7 —-11 years) (iv) Formal operation period (11-15 years) The stage of classification depends on students’ abil- ity to focus on a single characteristic of objects in a set and group of objects according to that characteristic. Thus, statement II is incorrect. (b) Research Aptitude Descriptive Hypothesis: This contains only one variable so it is called a univariate hypothesis. This typically states the existence, size, form or distribu- tion of some variable.

Summary:
At higher temperatures, nitrogen dioxide is a reddish-brown gas that can be fatal if inhaled in large quantities, with most atmospheric NO2 produced through photochemical reactions in the atmosphere leading to the formation of photochemical smog.

Title: Types of Hypotheses and Logical Reasoning

Text:
) Research Aptitude Descriptive Hypothesis: This contains only one variable so it is called a univariate hypothesis. This typically states the existence, size, form or distribu- tion of some variable. It describes the situation or col- lects the data, the same as it has happened without adding our own assumptions as a researcher. Null Hypothesis: the null hypothesis (often denoted Ho) is that two possibilities are the same. The null hypothesis is that the observed difference is due to chance alone. Using statistical tests, it is possible to cal- culate the likelihood that the null hypothesis is true. Explanatory Hypothesis: This hypothesis guides the cause and effect relationship between two variables. For example, when salaries increase, then spending on food items also increase. Intervening and confounding variables add to the impact of independent variables on dependent variables. (c) Logical Reasoning The denotative meaning of a word is simply the commonly accepted meaning or the definition that you would find if you were to look up that word in a dictionary. Typically, the connotative meaning of a word has more of an emotional association and is more likely to trigger an emotional response than the denotative meaning. 44, (b) Logical Reasoning 45. Truth and falsehood are predicates of a statement and validity and invalidity are predicates of an argument. 46. (b) 47. 48. 50. (a).

Summary:
Research hypotheses can be categorized as descriptive, null, or explanatory, with each serving a different purpose in determining the relationship between variables, while logical reasoning involves understanding the denotative and connotative meanings of words and distinguishing between truth and falsehood in statements and validity and invalidity in arguments.
